"0#Open discussions lead us to success|John, Maureen, and Chris- thank you for having an open and honest discussion last week about our weekly creative reviews to each walk away with ways to make this workflow smoother for ourselves and our teams. We each have an important part to play in keeping our brand top of mind. We found some immediate efficiencies, after just 2 weeks in. We will continue to improve and do it together. Chris- I especially appreciate your willingness and utter excitement about utilizing the new proof dashboard in Workfront outside of these meetings! (Haha) It may not be as glamorous as we’d like it to be, but it’ll help your entire team get the answers they need in a crystal clear, consistent way. Thanks for getting on board!\n\n1#Heart to heart to beat burnout|Thank you Chris for using our latest creative meeting to focus on burnout and not only on how we can help each other, but giving us a safe space to talk about it all. You think about us individually and as a whole....I really appreciate it. THANK YOU!\n\n2#Thank you 🙏🏻|Today I sit, truly humbled and grateful for this group of creative minds. We are a cross-section of so many different parts of the business – joined together by a mutual love and respect of design, problem-solving, and innovation. Each and every one of you gave up a huge chunk of your week to connect about our brand look and feel. We walked each other through challenges. We shared feedback, ideas, insights, goals. We learned a lot about the unique challenges each team faces, and how our visuals could better support. But most of all – dare I say, we had some fun? Our workshops/challenges were intense, and forced us each out of our comfort zones.... but woah: such excellent creative ideas in such short time!   Thank you all for kicking the year off with such a great show of support, passion, innovation and collaboration.  Bring it on 2022.\n\n3#To greatness!|I wanted to take a moment to set the right tone for 2022 by saying thank you and acknowledging all the great we were able to produce as a team. All the collaboration and effort we put in helped to make my part more effective. I hope I was able to do the same. Thank you for helping me track down files, providing constructive feedback, addressing copy edits, and for your collaboration on all the web, demo/abm projects...  as Owen would say, #blessed :)  Happy new year and wishing you all the best\n\n4#One Team|Teamwork and collaboration are at the forefront of what makes Workhuman successful, and each of you is a shining example. When we saw the opportunity to leverage the IBM webinar by creating a small subset of the video, you stepped in to ensure we were on brand. Ditto the Scott Dussault videos, which the reps can use in their senior-level outreach. Cullen – thank you for the templates and creative guidance. Owen – thank you for your keen eye and copyedit suggestions. And Chris – thanks for opening the lanes to whoosh these through. Brand marketing and sales enablement, working together. Thank you for your partnership.\n\n5#Best sweater in one (or more) categories!|Abby, Jen P, Holly, Angela, Chris L and Lauren B - Thank you for bringing your \"A\" (or is it \"U\" as in ugly sweater) game to our town hall meets holiday \"fashion(?)\" mash up today. You each provided shining examples across a number of prestigious categories as voted on by a panel of your peers - categories including: Best overall, Best single dinosaur, Best multiple dinosaur, Most electrified, Most able to considered a regular sweater, and Best tattoo'd Santa sweater. Thank you for helping bring some good cheer and humor to today's event. With gratitude, - Richard and Chris\n\n6#There is a Superhero in all of us|Blown away again by his team's commitment to dropping everything to come together and use their collective talents to drive the business. Here's to all of you in celebration of teamwork!  When it matters most, we step up, rally the troops, and march right into the battle headfirst. Yesterday was another great example of what happens when you bring great minds together, the sparks fly, the ideas flow and suddenly we have a solution. There is a Superhero in all of us, we just have to put on the cape. Cheers to the team!\n\n7#In this moment...|I'm excited, motivated, energized... grateful. Thank you Chris for everything that you have done for our brand, our team, and for me personally. Working together has been a great ride so far. I love when we get on our creative rambling tangents and come up with interesting ideas. And I equally enjoy when we get into debates (read: friendly arguments), on things and ultimately laugh stuff off when we realize we're actually agreeing. Thats the best part of working on your team, is the fact that we can be real, and have honest human interactions about pretty much anything. This morning, we had a run-of-the-mill check-in about all the projects and requests coming in, and how to streamline/prioritize my involvement. Honestly, it was great to talk through it, and walk away feeling like we have a handle on things. Thanks for being the person - leader, that you are.\n\n8#Thanks for a Great Presentation!|Hi Chris & Jay - Great presentation today! It was really inspiring. Thanks for taking the time! I agree with the comment you made about \"without the human, it's just work\".  It says it all!  (Welcome Human - Brand and Customer Marketing overview.)\n\n9#Cyber-Success|Congratulations to this team on a successful Cyber-week promotional campaign for Workhuman Live.  The team went above and beyond the expected with multiple meetings, rework of creative mid-stream, late night and weekend work – with a focus on driving results.  Promotions like this are important to our success, and are a clear example of how teamwork and collaboration creates results.  Your efforts helped drive over 100 new registrations in just one week, helping accelerate our audience growth.  Well done by all!\n\n10#Brainstorm workshop … or Mind Typhon?|Team, amazing work coming together this week to collaborate on Workhuman Live.  We are at the point in the journey where its time to pivot.  You all took the time to join together in the office (some of you for the fist time since March 2020) and review messaging, branding, promotion, and website.  Every one of you readily adopted the ground rules for the day by leaving all egos at home, keeping an open mind, having some radical candor, and being purposefully critical.  We have a huge list of takeaways that are now in the process of being summarized and prioritized so it’s all actionable to drive Workhuman Live forward toward our goals.  I am proud to work and partner with you all.  Amazing work.\n\n11#Cyber Week Pivots|Team - cannot thank you enough for jumping in and prioritizing the reminder message for Workhuman Live Cyber week.  Edits were needed... and you made time to review and offer thoughtful and strategic improvements to the message.  We were on a true time crunch (the offer ends at midnight!!) and you delivered big.  Anthony - thank YOU for always being at the ready to execute the promotions... event at the very last minute.  Grateful to work with rock stars like you all.\n\n12#Getting the ABM band Back together!|I just wanted to thank all of you for your contributions to multiple ABM projects the week leading up to Thanksgiving. It's been a while since I've been in the ABM mix, but I was quickly reminded of just how much of an all-star powered machine this group is. In a short period of time you knocked out a critical microsite while creating an updated, and most importantly reusable video asset that will be an incredibly valuable tool for our Sales team to leverage in the months to come. Fantastic work!!!\n\n13#Scenario Planning Sesh #1 was what I'd call a Win|My head is spinning from all the inspired thinking in today's planning meeting. Thank you for sharing your Plans on a Page <or is it 'Plan on a Pages?!'> with the broader team. Thank you for deep diving into some of our Marketing priorities to identify integration points, gaps, opportunities for testing, and more. It was awesome to see different people gather to collaborate cross-functionally and spend time thinking about the \"what if sh....scenarios.\" And lastly, thank you for being good sports about the ice breakers questions. From Buzz Lightyear to time machine travel, childhood crushes  and early retirement dreams, I learned a lot of new things about each of you today!  And yet, I am sure you all agree that it felt like we barely scratched the surface in our three hours today. Not to worry! This is the starting point and I have a good feeling that this was just the first of many Scenario Planning sessions to come. So strap in and look forward to next steps AND the next invite. I am excited to work together to ensure we are set up to deliver business results, feel proud of our work, and have some fun along the way.\n\n14#Getting \"IT\" Done|Just a small token of my gratitude to you all for stepping in and stepping up to get IT done. There were multiple emails that initially started with a request for an updated 4min Workhuman overview video to include Inclusion Advisor for an executive deck Aaron and I have to deliver to the Cleveland Clinic. Shortly thereafter I was asked to record a similar video for a micro-site for Michelin so I piled on to the request knowing we could use this video instead, but pleaded with you all for urgency as we needed it by the end of this week. Brian, you coordinated a zoom call for us to hash out the details, Nuvs you provided some video clips to leverage for the addition of AI, Chris you found the right words to say to capture the WHY IA, and Cullen you brought the artistic mastery to share just enough to tease out a deeper dive with a live demo to follow the video clips.  Thank you all for a fresh face on our 4minute video. Those that I work most closely with know how much I leverage these and I appreciate your respect for urgency!\n\n15#Planning for Purpose!|Team,  What an incredibly informative, purposeful, and quality team-building day! Thank you for being present and prepared, for sharing your FY22 department vision and goals, and for collaborating on a unified FY22 brand marketing plan and most importantly our guiding purpose as a leadership team. I feel energized, optimistic, united and supported, and look forward to taking on the challenges that FY22 will bring.\n\n16#The goal is progress, not perfection!|“First steps are always the hardest but until they are taken the notion of progress remains just a notion and not an achievement” — Through a time of transition, new planning processes and forecasts, and current executional needs this team has been exceptional. You’ve come together, forced needed changes, asked the right questions, and most importantly you’ve done it as a team. Thank you for leading by example, overcoming the daily challenges, and for accepting new perspectives and approaches.   You are building our game plans now so we can all enter the stadium with confidence together next year.   Remember, The goal is progress, not perfection\n\n17#Leading the way!|Jess, John, Richard, Chris, and Amy - thank you for putting together a great Brand All-Hands. I have heard from many folks who loved hearing from their colleagues and seeing all the great work being done.  What is also clear: we are a team who is committed to each other just like we are committed to excellence.  Thank you for leading the way today and every day.\n\n18#Terrific Trifecta|I wanted to take a moment to recognize you three as a wonderful support system for me. Last Friday we came together to discuss a challenge and at the end I truly believe we are stronger because of it. Our ability to have an open, honest and transparent conversation let us to come to an even stronger bond and a resolution. Chris, John, and Richard, you inspire me to be better and I couldn’t imagine being on this journey with anyone else. I appreciate you all very much and thoroughly enjoy partnering with you every day.\n\n19#Certified superheroes|Kudos to this team for bringing the re-imagined certified back to life on workhuman.com.  The new experience is cleaner, faster, and more user friendly which will help support a growing program for our customers. Great work all!\n\n20#Launching the next phase of Workhuman Certified|I wanted to thank all of you for the tremendous work all of you have done bringing the new Workhuman Certified website to life. From streamlining the application process to introducing the traits of a human workplace through rich video content, UX and design this is a huge step forward for the Certified movement, and lays the groundwork for exciting days ahead. This is an amazing group of humans to collaborate with, and I appreciate the talent and hard work you bring to Workhuman day in and day out. Thank you!\n\n21#Teamwork that is Certified A+|I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the creativity and commitment you brought to Workhuman Certified Enterprise this week. The website is looking phenomenal with copy and design that reinforces the mission of Certified and an intelligent, data-based UX strategy that promotes easier access for enterprise applicants and professionals looking to start their personal certified journey. In addition to the website we have a new pitch deck and badges on the way that enhance our ability to reach out to organizations to invite them to join us in this movement. This is only the beginning a long road for WHCE, but collaborating with a team like this is what makes this job fun, and I’m so appreciative of all your contributions.\n\n22#United Introduction|Chris! Thank you for the introduction to your friend at United. As we all know, anything is possible at a backyard barbeque, including the potential of creating a new opportunity for Workhuman! It was a great initial call and we learned a lot. This feels like a great fit and we are getting in a a fantastic point in their journey. They clearly are thinking about the employee experience in the right way and I'm excited to continue the conversation with them! Thank you again for your introduction!\n\n23#Always with the words|I am going to try my hardest to break the inclusion advisor with this one.. ;) Chris thanks so much for continuing to push quality. Even with tight deadlines, last minute changes, dealing with myself on zoom, you continue to push for excellence. While I am at it, thanks for leading the design team and helping us work better together. I appreciate it.....I said it...I appreciate it, not you. Little ahead of yourself on that one 😜(for reals I do appreciate you though)!\n\n24#Without the human, it's just work|Jess, John, Richard, Amy, Tyler, Chris, Ana, and Dana - Each week, you bring your all to the brand leadership team vision, mission, and goals. From strategy to execution and everything in between, I am thrilled to work with you exceptional humans. So proud of the work we are doing together.   GO TEAM!\n\n25#Smart, human leadership|Chris and Moe, your support and guidance has meant so much to me throughout my time at Workhuman. You’ve been doing this all along, but more recently, watching you run meetings, connect people and cross-functional teams has been such an education. Chris, as the people leader of the creative department you do so much (connecting us regularly, keeping us focused and informed, setting priorities, listening). And now, working with you on World Gratitude Day, I also get to watch you do it all: from creative direction and writing, to connecting teams and setting up presentation decks, to creating UX flows and solving challenges. Thank you! Moe, I love listening to you on the many meetings we attend together. You’re constantly asking smart questions and I’m so envious of your knack for articulating complex issues in the simplest, most concise terms :)  I feel conversations always move forward in positive ways when you’re involved.  I also so appreciate that you continue to be so supportive of me with advice and guidance. And, of course, thank you for starting/running Brand Camp, it’s been a joy to be able to connect with creatives from across the company every Friday to share ideas/stories/inspiration. You two are amazing, thank you for all you do!\n\n26#Grinding it out|Thanks for jumping in on short notice, making room in your schedules and grinding with me to develop concepts and comps for the Convos and SM presentation. No Limit Soldiers!\n\n27#Next Level Deck Builders!|Chris, Jay and Moe - Thank you for jumping in and up-leveling the Workhuman Certified Welcome deck for our upcoming Phase 1 outreach campaign. We look to invite many new organizations to join the movement in the weeks leading up to the Live event in October. In most cases this will be a company's first exposure to Certified, and you masterfully defined the what and the why while aligning the visuals and language with our new brand standards. Looking forward to a successful campaign with this key asset in place!\n\n28#For your awesome team spirit|I wanted to show my appreciation for all your help, for the countless times you were there to answer all my questions. It's pleasure to work with you!\n\n29#Celebrating our voices|Chris, I'm super grateful to have this level of trust with my manager. Despite your nutty schedule, and 10,000 open tabs, you're always checking in on your people. You listen to our ideas, opinions and observations (good and bad) while encouraging us to consider different angles. And whether we all see it first hand or not, you're always advocating on our behalf - because thats just how you are wired. Thanks for being you.\n\n30#Where did the time go?!|Let's be honest, some Zoom calls can draaaaag on. We meet every Wednesday. And this particular Wednesday, we had a FULL house of Marketing Leaders who were FULLy engaged, thanks to you three. John and Biz - I appreciate you sharing key insights you've gathered from the website advisory committee and executive council and providing visibility into short and long term areas of focus for wh.com. Chris - you proactively reached out to me this morning and volunteered to bring the group up to speed on World Gratitude Day planning and creative development. Both sessions were important updates that help us find integration points and ensure we're aligned in our collective marketing efforts. Thank you for the role you played in leading a productive and fast paced meeting today!\n\n31#Grateful for each of you!|Early planning for World Gratitude Day has me feeling pretty grateful. Kevin, you have been such a great partner on WGD, working hard to lift your strategy off the ground. Thank you for working on multiple briefs, strategy decks and presenting your big picture goals to multiple teams. Chris and John, thank you both for dedicating time to WGD by fitting all of the strategic information and deliverables we’ve collected over the past few months into the new brief and working collaboratively to formalize the new process you’ve been working on to create a better structure for Tier 1 work. To each of you (James, Jon, Melissa, Allison, Jason, Lisa, Colleen, Christina, Katie, and Laura) who put in the effort to propose deliverable ideas and present them for input in our intake meeting, thank you for strategizing on all the different levels of brand awareness! Liu, thank you for all your creative thinking and concepting as we gear up to start kicking off projects so we can fit and align everything together as a story. Ana thank you for stepping in to listen during our big intake meeting on several department’s proposed deliverables and then sharing back a fully drawn out Lucid Chart to map out the user journey, flag concerns, and point out gaps. There’s a lot of work happening right now to bring this all together in a cohesive manner. I’m so happy we’re months ahead planning for a day that makes total sense for Workhuman to own!\n\n32#And then there were 3. Again.|Heyo! Today, monday May 17th, 2021 is Chris Claude's first day! We couldn't be more excited to welcome another video professional to the creative team at Workhuman. Thank to you and your diligence, we can increase our output and capabilities for all of Workhuman's video needs. You overcame obstacles, communicated clearly, and problem solved wonderfully. Thank you for your hard and swift efforts. With all these video folks running around, you might just wind up in some so be on the lookout!\n\n33#Tools of the Trade|Hello! I want to take a minute and prop you up for your help in the latest expansion of video production equipment. After nearly 4 years, and thousands of hours of shooting, we experienced some wear and tear with our video camera leaving us with limited capabilities and needing to send it for repairs. You were swift with communication and decision making, thoughtful with your questions (sometimes I geek out with the video nerd talk) and open minded to our options. Because of you and your help, we are poised to be VERY well equipped in combination with 2 new video team members, and ramping up plans for a video production studio in building 100 in Framingham. Thank you for assistance, and future productions will always have a little piece of you in them.\n\n34#Badge of Honor|Team, this month marks a time in our company's history: a linear TV/CTV and omni-channel brand campaign.  Bringing our company's first commercial to market has been quite the adventure.  Despite years of experience between us, none of us had ever brought an ad to market during a pandemic. We learned so much together. It has been joyful, difficult, fun, frustrating, and one of the best examples of resilience, trust, compassion, and teamwork I have seen,  At each and every step, you remained positive, committed, and determined to create something beautiful.  Thank you for all of your hard work.  Excited to see what comes next. I am so proud of you!\n\n35#Being the spark!|Liu and Chris, appreciate the time this morning meeting with a subset of the customer development marketing team. We are thrilled to partner more closely with the creative team to develop a strong sense of customer strategy, the journey and how this can impact the creative output. Greatly appreciate the inquisitiveness on the customer journey and the thoughtful discussion throughout. Excited for the future!\n\n36#Being the Spark!|Chris, our Be the Spark sessions have been such an incredible tool as part of the Brand Ambassadorship, ensuring our refreshed branding is shared across our organization in a way that is digestible and understood. Thank you for reviewing the messaging guide with our humans! This material is so critical to success of our cohesive brand story and our goal towards becoming an iconic brand.\n\n37#My quickest hire yet!|First, congrats on your newest hire! Regi is going to be such a great addition to the team. Second, and not for the first time, thank you for combing your network and bringing forward a stellar candidate before we even formally posted the role. This was a winning strategy last year when we brought on Liu, and was successful again this time around with Regi. It's no surprise to me that multiple people from your past are wandering into your present to work with you again. In a time where capacity is an issue for the recruiting team, it was a true delight to have a finalist candidate wrapping up interviews by the time we even posted the job. THANK YOU for being such a great partner to recruiting! These quick wins are making up for all the time it took me to find YOU! (well worth the wait)\n\n38#Oh what a web you did conceive!!|Team, The amount of work was immense, and you nailed it.  The website is a major leap forward, and you have established a new foundation for faster and greater growth.  Biz has kept me posted on the amount of work being done and the teamwork that pulled it off.    Congratulations on this incredible success, and many more to come!\n\n39#Operation Cullen Procurement|Hey folks! I wanted to take a minute and thank you for your time and insight into interviewing a new member of the video team. We are all so busy in meeting-palooza and developing grand plans to fix everything and take over the world. This is why I'm so grateful for your time in interviewing Cullen Barnett. He is going to be a great addition to the team, the brand, and the business. Cheers to you!\n\n40#Beyond Grateful for the Brand Book|Today was a huge day for our company. It is with a grateful heart I thank you for the long, countless hours of research, design, word-smithing, and fit and finish over the past few months creating our refreshed Brand Book. For making this dream a reality. For all the zoom calls, the slack messages, the emails and even texts. For pouring your heart and soul into this project, the late nights, weekends, and exorbitant amount of work accumulating into the beautiful set of tools for our company to grow and scale with. This is just the beginning, setting us up for success and I couldn’t be more proud. Thank you.\n\n41#When a dream becomes a reality|Months ago, Jess and I shared a conversation, almost giddy with the dream of creating a brand book in honor of the brand we both love. It's been a whirlwind of blood, sweat, tears, and laughter ever since. I am so proud of the Brand Book you created together. It's not often to see something in your head come to life so beautifully and so quickly that it exceeded what you thought was possible. Your collective and individual commitment to excellence has shown through in spades! Happy Workhuman Brand  Day!  Congratulations on a true team effort!\n\n42#Terrific Team Training!|Chris, Moe and Jess - thank you all  for your time and preparation training the customer marketing team on the new brand book and messaging. It was such a jammed packed agenda of pure goodness. We are so excited as a team to have stronger guidelines and messaging to help us remain aligned and provide the ability to be far more agile in our approach. I know I was a bit crazy and specific on the agenda (and thank you for being so able and willing!!!). We so appreciate the hard work and dedication and cannot wait for the big launch! Cheers to you all!\n\n43#Light at the end of the tunnel|Digital SWAT Team - Can you see it? I can!...And it feels good. Evolving the website to be a more human experience, reflective of the new brand, and better suited to help us achieve stronger business results, faster is no small feat. Soon, everyone will see the first big tranche of your impressive web work. I am grateful for your steadfast collaboration, patience, creativity, and determination since we committed to this initiative last fall. I know it's been a long, windy road and the journey doesn't exactly end once we go live. However, I hope you are proud and excited. It's been a real pleasure seeing this team in action...Thank you all!\n\n44#Problem Solving|Thanks so much for popping on a quick call this week to brainstorm how to iterate and improve the customer newsletter process and content. Diaries are jam-packed with lots of projects in the air. So greatly appreciate the time taken to hear viewpoints, ideate and discuss feedback in a super productive way! I think we landed in a good spot and excited for the future. Cheers to this great team!\n\n45#It’s a wrap part deux|Owen- Thank you so much for your incredible efforts with our first ever commercial shoot! We are so lucky to have you on this team, sharing your unique voice and adding value with every word.   It is an honor to experience this important company milestone with you.\n\n46#Guiding lights|Thank you Maureen and Chris for your always timely and thoughtful guidance on a variety of projects. You both are masters of your craft in addition to great managers, problem-solvers and multi-taskers. You're generous with your time even when that's in short supply. It's a privilege to witness the level of clarity and forward-thinking that you bring to every project you lead. I have never walked away from a meeting with you feeling like my questions weren't answered or unsure of what to do next. So grateful for both of you and all you do to set a project up for success.\n\n47#It’s a wrap on our first commercial shoot!|Team, it was a thrill to be part of our first ever Workhuman commercial shoot with each of you. While we weren’t physically on set, we were able to come together in our virtual new world to be part of this very special experience. Each of you put in a really long hours and worked with so much care to ensure that we do our company proud on our route to be the most iconic brand the planet earth has ever seen.  Here’s to making the world of work a place where all humans feel seen.\n\n48#Impressive Leader!|This is long overdue! From all the web work to the commercial shoot your leadership has been incredibly impressive. You’re always able to see the big picture while at the same time executing on the smaller projects to get us there. I really appreciate your support and guidance as I navigate through this new powerpoint world 😉 Your calm, can do attitude is exactly what is needed to get sh*t done!\n\n49#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n50#So we meet again!|That moment where you get brought into a project not knowing what to expect. Then I realized the crew involved is full of forward thinking, strategy, and heart. Which makes it all flow!  Working on the WH site with all of you has been a pleasure. You don’t hold back on talking about the hard stuff all the while making sure you are not missing anything. Last week I started on the on designs for one of the pages. Because of all of your work I was able to have such a solid foundation to work from. This has allowed me to design w/o crazy amounts of back and forth. Thank you to each and every one of you!\n\n51#We make magic happen|A few weeks ago I remember being on a call with you and you jokingly said 'we still got it Jess!' I'll never forget that moment of camaraderie and knowing I've got your back and you've got mine. By the looks of the momentous achievements we make together, we really make magic happen for Workhuman. I know that we can always have honest, fun conversations with each other and still produce some incredible things that are catapulting Workhuman into the next Brand stratosphere. Couldn't do this without you my friend, thanks for being a great partner.\n\n52#And the Oscar for Leaders in a Mktg Keynote are...|Team, Chris and I cannot thank you enough for your relentless and selfless efforts to bring the 2021 Marketing keynote to the Ignite stage.  Our greatest joy as leaders is being able to represent all of you – to spotlight our shared capabilities, make sure you are seen, and to work alongside each of you as we fuel every single one of our fellow humans at Workhuman with the best marketing has to offer.  The only way to do this is through collective and individual passions, expertise, brains, and brawn… and coffee and very little sleep … and coffee. This truly is an award based on humans helping other humans.  You exemplify humanity in the workplace and we could not be more proud of the work you led for this year’s kick-off event. It was an incredible moment for Chris and me to be able to reflect out to – THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION – a new vision and path forward to being an ICONIC BRAND\n\n53#Creative brains unite for Ignite!|To my marketing creatives preparing Ignite deliverables. I see you working nonstop. I see you putting in so much thought, detail, heart and soul into each element you’re working on. Though this year will be a different experience, you’re putting extra special touches here and there and everywhere that will truly bring magic to the show! What would we do without your creative brains and talent? Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication over the past few weeks. Were a week away and I’m so excited to see it all come to life. Take a deep breath and know, all the work you are putting in brings the output of a truly energized, informed, united company!\n\n54#Advanced Appreciation|Hi peeps. Mid January means Ignite is in high gear. A stressful time to add work onto your other marketing work. It's going to be great. Your time, energy, and resourcefulness to turn the event digital is much appreciated. Thank you. Finish strong!\n\n55#The Lee School for Mindful Movement|What a way to start the day!!! Having knowledge is nice, but sharing knowledge is magical. I wanted to thank you for sharing your mix of Tai Chi, meditation, and energy movement with us this morning! It was wonderful to start the day with some of my favorite people, but also with a reminder to slow down, that small movements matter, and to just breathe. You started your day very early and tried to make it work for as many schedules as possible –a tough thing at any time–and walked us all through some great flows of breath, stretch, and movement. I hope you will do more of these, I  think it was a great test run and I know I'd sign up to do this again! This was just one of the awesome ways that you bring your whole self to work and how you take care of our team by helping us all take care of ourselves! THANK YOU!\n\n56#Dream Team|Team- what an incredible ride we have had this year!  When I think about all of the work we have done together, all of the groundwork we have laid, as a team, to create the iconic brand we know we are - I am in awe.  Each of you has stretched yourselves, tried new and intimidating tasks and responsibilities, and have never lost your grace and humanity. I am proud to work alongside you and to call you my friends.  Happy Holidays to you all.  Here's to an even better, out-of-this-world 2021!!\n\n57#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n58#Dream Team!|Taking a moment to thank you for all your support, mentorship, and hard work. Each of you has gone above and beyond in our web and rebrand projects and I can’t thank you enough. You’ve continued to impress me with your skills, teamwork, and determination all while having a great attitude. Each day I’m thankful to be part of such a great team. Here’s to ending 2020 strong and continuing all of our amazing work into 2021!    (ps - this image would be way better as a gif, Biz - can you fix the internet so we can add those here? thanks - appreciate you)\n\n59#Pioneers and Innovators for ABM 2021|Wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has contributed to the evolution and strategic approach for our sales priority accounts.    A lot of time, thought, and effort has gone into taking our messaging and strategy to the next level as we work with some of our top tier opportunities, including recently with Raytheon and SalesForce.  This new collaborative process will help drive engagement into some of our most sought-out accounts, with the potential to change the landscape for Workhuman!  Please pass this gratitude along to anyone not the list, or potentially outside of our org (thinking of our freelancers who have been called on to elevate their work to ensure best-in-class messaging)!  Cheers, all!\n\n60#Better starts here.|Digital Swat Team UNITE! I am so excited and proud of the first phase of updates to our Workhuman.com that were pushed live this week. The imagery is gorgeous. The messaging is crisp. The video testimonials are a wonderful addition to our customer page....Love the animation on the homepage showing Social Recognition in action. I could go on and on, but I won't. People can peruse the site at their leisure to see your amazing work. I am thankful for each of you and grateful for our shared commitment to evolving the web experience to one that is more human with every improvement (big and small) made. Better starts with this team.\n\n61#The Workhuman brand experience|A brand is an alchemy of identity, emotion, experiences, charisma – the soul of the company and the products it makes. Remove any of these factors you’re left looking at only part of the picture. Unless you look at how people interact with a company and its products, you don’t have a holistic picture of the brand. The experience is cohesive and purposeful though brand identity, marketing communications, physical environments and product experiences. I'm so grateful to partner with you and your teams to create the total Workhuman brand experience. Bridging the gaps between product and brand and ultimately designing those cohesive experiences that create strong emotional connections in order to build trust, drive preference, and ultimately create affinity. Because of you, this has been one of the best collaborative initiatives I've had the pleasure of working on at Workhuman and can't wait to see it all come to life!\n\n62#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n63#High impact WH Certified trailer|The Workhuman Certified trailer is a wonderful example of yet another high-quality video produced this year. The proof is in the data: over 2.5% CTR and engagement rates on social media! And it's worth emphasizing that this was targeting outside our native Workhuman follower or customer audiences such as Marketing Managers and HR Managers too.  Thanks to all those who contributed to its creation!\n\n64#Way to go, digital swat team!|We're only at the beginning of what's going to be a long journey, but based on all the Zoom meetings, emails and Slack discussions we've had over the last week getting ready for what resulted in a great input session with Patti today, I have to say that I couldn't be more thrilled to be on this ride with this team. Let the fun begin!\n\n65#Have a Minute? ... And Much More|When I was approached with pulling together a plan and resources for a short-form video series to provide education on “who we are and what we do,” each of you stepped up in a big way to make it happen. The “Have a Minute” video series showcases different Workhuman themes that not only educate, but humanize our brand. From simply answering the question, “Who is Workhuman?,” to articulating why the annual review is not enough, to discussing the differences between employee engagement and employee experience, to promoting the new book, Live Online, and Workhuman Certified – “Have a Minute?” has provided a punchy, quick lens into our business through our humans. Whether you have been behind the scenes with video, script writing or reporting, in front of the camera, or hosting the series (that’s you, Patti), I appreciate the time, energy, and focus you bring to the program. We’ve learned a lot from this approach, and have some excellent ideas in the queue for making this bigger and better. Thanks for contributing to our mission to make work more human for every person around the globe.\n\n66#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n67#Boneless Chicken Ranch Farmer|Thanks Chris for somehow making almost all the meetings, having a clear view of everything, being patient, and somehow not start crying in a zoom meeting. Your ability to think of all the steps and wanting the best work to go forward…allowed for WH Certified to have a strong light shined on it. I appreciate working with you and I hope that you are able to get some well deserved R&R this weekend!\n\n68#Workhuman Certified Superstars|The words “thank you,” can’t begin to express the gratitude Brenda and I have for this team of talented colleagues who we’ve had the pleasure of working with to bring the Workplace Charter of Rights and Workhuman Certified to life. Whether you’ve been on this journey with us for the past year or the past month, you’ve all had a hand in helping us achieve our vision of changing the workplace for good. Our Marketing friends set the stage for success with a strong go-to-market strategy & brand design, an engaging web presence with compelling copy, customer pioneers to validate our program and tell their stories and customer “friendlies” to preview the program, influencer briefings, securing previous WH Live videos, and so much more! Our HR team challenged our new way of thinking about HR programs, helping to shape the Enterprise application process and ensuring we as a company were demonstrating progress in the Rights, while also preparing to educate and inform employees about this new initiative. And behind the scenes, our very own legal eagles were there to ensure everyone’s best interests were kept in mind. This is the largest cross-functional project we’ve been part of during our time at Workhuman, and we couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together. The saying is true…teamwork really does make the dream work! Thank you, all!\n\n69#Workhuman Live!|I felt like something was awfully wrong in the world this past weekend. I had NOTHING to do for the Workhuman Live broadcast this Thursday! So this is what it feels like to be ahead of the game and prepared a week early! Well done to you all for the preparation, planning, writing, filming, logistics, vendor management, technical excellence and execution of the creation of this fabulous event. The event looks amazing – and I include in that the subsequent web site creation and lead capture processes. It’s a slick and professional production, I’m sure it will be a huge hit. Awesome job, thank you all!\n\n70#Quality Assets|James, Matt, & Chris - You've been on overdrive for the last few weeks but I know you've been particularly heads down over the last week or so including 24/7 this weekend. In the midst of it all, I wanted to thank you for all the work you've put in to make the WHLO video interviews such high-quality. It was the easiest round of approvals from customers and speakers because it looks and sounds so spectacular. I'll share one of the responses I received from Claude Silver of VaynerMedia regarding the preview of her interview, “Wow wow wow!!!! They did an incredible job!! Please thank everyone for me!” It also has had a nice domino effect on getting the approvals we need for logos and quotes for the Certified launch. They saw how carefully you handled and constructed their stories for the live online event, which only makes their trust in us with their brands grow deeper.\n\n71#Sneak Peek Success!|I think the words that were coming through on the chat during the session say it best! So, I'll leave the image above to say most of it - this feedback and the way people felt by the closing of the session - you all created that. Thank you so much for quickly pulling together the session to share a sneak peek at what's to come for Workhuman Live on Oct. 22, and to inspire our employees about all that's to come. Well done!\n\n72#With panelists like this ...|It must be almost Workhuman Live Online time! Team fantastic job giving the strategic and energetic vibe we're striving for with WHL Online today during our employee preview! Response has been amazing and looking forward to the official reveal next week on 10/22 at 12:30pm EST!\n\n73#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n74#Looking both ways|We've got less days ahead of us than behind us on the journey to Workhuman Live Online. But there's no coasting downhill for this team. Some of the work is ramping up, some of it is continuing to speed along. You've all been putting forth your best efforts,  and many extra hours. The shared experiences build not only the event but also keeps the department strong. Cheers to you!\n\n75#A Tough Nut to Crack!|As we approach the final stretch of the Workhuman Certified Campaign I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the creativity and resilience you've demonstrated in the past week, really digging into the design of the Certified website. This site is a gateway to the entire WH experience and Workplace Rights while acting as a centerpiece of the GTM campaign.With that this team was presented with some of the toughest UX \"nuts\" we've had to crack, and you all rose to the challenge. While there is still a long road ahead of us (and more than a few tough nuts along the way) I'm sure this team will help lead the charge with an amazing digital experience as we introduce Workhuman Certified to the world. Thank you!\n\n76#Momentum is Building!  Charter of Workplace Rights|Thank you all for your enormous contributions to making the Workhuman Charter of Workplace Rights a reality!   Over various starts (well over a year ago), pauses (CV-19) and re-directions, today was truly a unique moment where so much great progress and momentum was on display at our steering committee!    The logo, design standards, tone of voice, advertising styles, landing & welcome pages, application forms, why now, double clicks for more details by type, FAQ’s, links to the HUB, messaging live in the field being tested, a go-market-plan with dates set, 3 customers locked for interviews and certification celebration…and more!   On so many fronts, I see the momentum building and its building FAST!  This was always going to be a rush to the finish line as Covid upended all best laid plans!   But I sense we’re close… more to do yes, but a final push now, and we’re ready to start charging the world of work for good, and our societies will be changed for the better too.  Thank you all for your role in this important mission!\n\n77#Building A Pathway To The Future|Team, thank you to each of you for letting me join your team meeting today. There is so much opportunity ahead. I left our discussion feeling excited by our agreed upon next steps as we build our pathway ahead.  Your ideas, your passion, and your desire to build for a better way of working together exemplifies respect for team and what it means to truly Workhuman.\n\n78#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt in the first week of go-live to make sure we have all your important information correct!\n\n79#All the Best...Practices|Team, fantastic job on the latest motion graphic video social ads for WHL Right to Belong & Book promotions. You incorporated approximately 79 best practices: mobile-optimized, square, motion, questions, numbers, names, hashtags, sense of urgency, color palate contrast, and more! I'm psyched to see how they do and am already in talks with other program owners about how we leverage these across other efforts. Thanks to all who contributed from Sarah's WHiQ insights to the copy collaborations with Chris/Owen/Lauren, and Jay's polishing and formatting of the mographs.\n\n80#In 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...|Team - Outstanding job presenting a compelling business case and supportive creative to secure investment for our first-ever foray into TV and streaming content advertising in the run up to WHL Online. I'm excited about the learnings this will unlock and appreciate your ability to \"act fast\" to capitalize opportunistically in leveraging great existing \"ad\" assets for screens everywhere between 9/25 - 10/21. Well done, -C\n\n81#Simply the best.|Vision, collaboration, encouragement, support, commitment... I could keep going. Chris, even when times are challenging, you’re there for all of us. Always leading with a diplomacy and compassion. I’m so grateful for everything that you do for our team, and so impressed with the change that you’ve helped to create. Thanks for a great team meeting today, and for all you are doing to support everyone across the board.\n\n82#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n83#Miro, Miro, on the Wall...|We all know how slow some things can be to change. At Workhuman, we have an affinity to powerpoint. What we also have at Workhuman is a plethora of talented artists and creators. Needless to say (or maybe not for some) that powerpoint is not the prefered tool of design for artists, generally speaking. Chris, you enabled us to move forward with pre-production planning using a preferred tool, Miro. You also let us keep using that tool to socialize our work with the marketing VPs. This was a bit of a new method for us but we weathered the storm and came to a place of alignment and shared vision. Chris, James, Jen, and Lauren: No one has ever done anything all on their own and this pre-production work is no different. Thank you for your brains, your eyes, your input, your pushback, your hole-poking, and your collaboration in developing the plan so far. I think we have a solid foundation to begin executing up against. Cheers!\n\n84#His Airness|Chris, I spent most of my late evenings this week watching the \"The Last Dance.\" The story read loud and clear.  Michael Jordan was an incredible solo talent, but he was an even better motivator by setting great examples.  I have been in a ton of meetings with you over the past weeks, and while its always present - something really hit me: Your tireless effort to move things forward.  A meeting this week that we all assumed to be a high level conversation became a focused dialogue in approach and understanding.  As a result, it identified opportunities where I can provide that same level of preparation and rigor, which will hopefully drive more focused results.  Thanks for providing a great example to follow, and reminding me that there is always new ways to contribute to winning.\n\n85#Trusting the process!|Team - thank you for buying into and committing to the new process and approach we're using to develop an integrated and collaborative 2H Marketing Plan (ie., offsite, collaboration, data-driven goal setting, etc.). Because of your willingness to lean into this new way of working we've been able to advance new creative, powerful, innovative ideas for 2H digital programming, virtual engagements, and WHL-S that tap into the zeitgeist, create urgency, represent that Companies that thrive Workhuman, in a way that is unique to our Brand and business. With gratitude, Chris & Patti\n\n86#Always pointing North|I wanted to thank you for being such a great leader–especially over the last months of what feels like a never-ending series of hoops to jump through! I feel like you never lose steam and you never lose focus. You keep us inspired to look at the goals and make great work – even when requests change in the middle. Your constantly open mind helps us see that greatness exists in every direction – and you always push us to make whatever we are working on the best it can be. I've been under some tight deadlines here but also had some home hurdles to handle and you've been great at helping me to manage both. I appreciate how much work you put into the creative, but also how much you put into the team–we need both in order to do good work! THANK YOU!\n\n87#The future is now. The future is working human.|Team - this group has been the nucleus for \"what's next.\" You've ripped up and thrown away the rule book for what was. You've embraced the freedom, liberation and inspiration that comes from having a blank sheet of paper to operate from. Yes, we've been grinding the last two weeks, but we are on the precipices of exciting concepts that will propel our brand and business forward. Keep pushing, we're nearly there. With gratitude, -C\n\n88#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n89#Beautiful teamwork|Once again, I had a front row seat to watch the creative team work their magic. A ridiculous deadline and not a lot of direction didn't stop the show. You tagged each other to make a beautiful ad today. Thank you!\n\n90#Always Making Time|Chris - no matter how much you have on your plate, how many meetings you're in, or how often you're navigating various changes, I want to thank you for always making time to meet 1:1. Even when there are shifting schedules and priorities and fire drills, you insist on keeping this time to sync up and listen. I know this is ingrained in our Workhuman culture, but you are truly proof of what it looks like in action. Because it's easy to put off check-ins when things get really busy. And you don't. Thanks for being such a supportive and caring leader.\n\n91#Creating a pathway to what's next|Chris, John, James, Maureen, and Owen - the executive team was thrilled when I shared the \"What's Next\" brief, story evolution, and campaign design today. Thank you for creating a way for us to evolve our story sharing to both inspires and enables our prospects and customers to truly Workhuman. This campaign represents an important evolution in many respects.  Your teamwork with each other and with your stakeholders is exactly how we collectively transform our brand trajectory.  Thank you!  Patti\n\n92#Putting the \"Lift off\" in \"Kick off\"|Team - as workplaces everywhere contemplate the next phase of work, we are leading the way in what that looks like externally and with our customers. It also means we need to evolve internally. I was so impressed by the team work and open mindedness demonstrated by this cross-functional group in today's kick off! So, as they say, \"Houston, we have lift off!\" Excited to see where this group takes the next phase of what it means to thrive and workhuman. With gratitude, -C\n\n93#What Makes Us Human: Heart and Soul|Team, when most of us are feeling defeated, deflated, and hopeless, each of you came together to unite our hearts and souls with the people we most want to reach. I shed more than one tear experiencing the imagery and messages of hope and pragmatism. Your respect, empathy, and compassion for all hearts and souls inside and outside of our company has made an impact.  Thank you for transforming a sad exception to our lives into one that brings us together instead of dividing us all.  As always, thank you for your hard work and determination to Workhuman. Best, Patti\n\n94#Collab fab|Hey Chris. I wanted to tell you how much it meant to me that you set up a meeting with Patti and squad today to talk through Eric's video asset. Taste and preference with video is always a challenge. Just like with things we make externally, same goes for internally: you can't please all the people all the time. I don't have to tell you this, being a seasoned veteran. I appreciate you giving me a platform and opportunity to speak my mind and my thoughts regardless of if you or anyone else agreed with them or not. It means a lot to me for my personal growth and I think you set a great example as a leader. Cheers.\n\n95#True Grit and a Whole Lotta Awesome|John, Chris, and Maureen - WOW! You ARE the innovation equation. Thank you for jumping in and creating a world class story to share about going back to the office. This next phase of the pandemic, from a business perspective, is filled with as many unknowns as we had a few months ago. The challenge is that business leaders and HR are fatigued, their people are fatigued, and their customers are fatigued. What you have quickly and expertly enabled is a dialogue, a new conversation based on empathy and respect, that may trigger a new and much-needed new conversation about innovation, employee experience, and joy in the workplace. THANK YOU!\n\n96#Fierce commitment to urgency|\"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there IS such a thing as being too late. This is not time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.\" - MLK JR.   Team, since I started just over a month ago, I have heard from many of you and our stakeholders who have talked about the misfortune of joining Workhuman during a global pandemic that has changed every thing about how we live: from how we interact, to what we spend our time and money on, what we value, and how we work.  The truth is, there was no better time for me to be able to witness the magic that is Workhuman. We already know what is important and that is human connection. What you have demonstrated is humanity during a time of extreme urgency - a rarity in life and certainly in business. Thank you for your passion for your and your commitment to each other and our stakeholders.  I am honored to work alongside each of you.\n\n97#Moodtracker Launch success!|Team – Thank you for delivering our brand new Moodtracker product. Thank you so much to everybody for the amazing work on the Moodtracker product. Hard to believe this was just an idea at the beginning of January. Since then a team has formed, the product designed, architected, built, tested, branded, communicated, marketed and launched. Whew. The speed at which the groups collaborated is a tribute to the sense of camaraderie and positivity we have at Workhuman. The energy, imagination has shone through in every way. This coupled with the determination to deliver a world-class product means that today we have a sixth edition to our Workhuman Cloud suite. Welcome Moodtracker. On behalf of all of the humans in the company, thank you. Eric.\n\n98#A Perfect Go-to-Market Partnership|Moodtracker go-to-market team, its been an absolute pleasure working with all of you, on both the marketing side and product side. Stewart, Bruno, Chase and Adam, you provided the solid foundation that kicked this team off in the right direction as a source of product knowledge and consistent support with in-product visuals and brand guidance. Ger and Jess, not only did you establish a fantastic brand for Moodtracker but you also came up huge in the final push, driving the microsite and video to the next level. Julie, your user testing and insights mid-week were perfectly timed to dial in the messaging of the microsite. Lauren, as always your dedication to the voice of the messaging and attention to detail were critical to providing top quality content for the entire campaign. Chris L, you were in many ways the heart and soul of this campaign, keeping us focused and inspired while working with Sean and the team at Fresh all the way to launch. And finally, Z and Ilana, with your strategy in place my job was easy. I couldn’t ask for better partners on this journey, all I can say is you guys are simply amazing and such an asset to Workhuman. I look forward to continued collaboration with all of you in the months to come!\n\n99#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n100#Making it all come together|I cannot thank you peeps enough for the amazing collaboration on Livestream. A keynote is a monumental project on its own, but translating into a digital keynote-ish thing, with interviews, sudden surprise guests, and a product launch down to the wire – all during a pandemic when we couldn't all get into a room with a whiteboard and lay this whole thing out – is an achievement beyond compare. You all dug in and offered your amazing expertise about everything from the best practices of online live streaming video content, to headlines for the promotion, and wrote or conducted interview questions for last-minute customers. Our slack channels were super efficient, everyone communicated constantly, and no one took their eyes off the goal. I could not possibly have done this without all of you – it was the perfect storm of teamwork and excellence. It was a rollercoaster, but I appreciate all of you, they way you kept a good sense of humor and leaned into every new idea that came our way. If I had to do it again (and I'm sure we will!) I'd pick this team! Thank you!\n\n101#If we looked up \"innovation\" in the dictionary...|Chris- the work you are leading on WHLStream, Moodtracker, and Thank You Healthcare, all the while not letting anything drop in BAU is the stuff innovators salivate over.  The work is helping us to push the envelope - that is never easy to do.  An innovator's secret is not just in that creativity in solving problems better than anyone else, it also requires grit. You got that and then some. THANK YOU for all you are doing.\n\n102#Thank you for a warm welcome|I feel so lucky to be a part of the team! The three of you have made me feel super welcome, valued, and supported (and I haven't even done anything yet!) Looking forward to growing the WH brand together.\n\n103#A world of help!|Jess – I wanted to say thank you for whole-heartedly jumping in and dusting off your design skills to create an image of the Thank You Healthcare map properly formatted for LinkedIn Elevate. We didn't have anything \"official\" besides a screenshot, and you volunteered in Jay's place as he was busy with other high-priority initiatives.  Jay, Dianne, Chris, Katie, Carrie – Thank you all for your help with looping in the right people and sending design specs and templates. Your support with this quick-turn request helped me get the post live that same day, and it's now been shared by nearly 50 of our colleagues and has earned 84.1K reach and 178 engagements since it was published on April 17. Thank you!\n\n104#Questions & Answers = Crushing it|The questions were: \"Are you there?\" \"You working?\" \"Can you come inside on this beautiful Sunday?\" The answers from this group were \"Yes!\" \"How can I help?\" \"Be right there!\"  Thank your dedication, time out of your weekend (or your whole weekend), and flexibility. For answering your phone, responding to texts, jumping on calls, endless Slacks, and using Workfront ;-)  Multiple communication channels are needed to launch a promotional campaign in 4 days, over a weekend, while working remotely. I am proud of you, to be a part of this team, and for what we accomplished together. Thank you.\n\n105#Livestream Launch!|I was going to find an image of a nice stream for this recognition, but the way this team came together and launched – with immediate results (more on that below) – a rocket made more sense.  We have been in a hurry up and wait, start and stop process on bringing a digital/live stream event to market for a bit now.  In the past few weeks it all started to come together, and this past weekend it all really came together.  Our band of weekend warriors once again rallied to pull everything into place and then dragged many more souls into the battle for a rapid Monday launch.  With Dianne at the helm providing impeccable project management and, might I say, a few beatings we were all kept on task.  Jen, Chris, Kevin, and Jay – you were right there every step of the way on design iterations and animations.  Owen, you’ve been a master of the nuanced wordsmithing we’ve needed on this.  Matt, Biz, Geoff and Mark – you built, staged, tested, and launched all new site pages and elements in almost no time at all.  Your work set-up for a great launch – where we dragged in Anthony to build, test, and deploy our emails with about an hours time from asset to release.  Rob and Roshni jumped in to iterate social/digital and bring us live globally.  Colleen, Anne and Jess pulled the enablement tools and comms together and put them in everyone’s hands to help us all share and promote the program.  Mike and Lauren working the external networks to amplify and extend reach.  And Jill.  Maintaining a calm presence, helping align priorities and strategy, and ensuring we’re on track for the overall business goal.  We’re really just a the start of a 3-week journey.  Much work is yet to be done, but you put us in the best possible place to succeed.  So much so, that within hours of launching, we already over 1000 registrants.  Impressive!  I so enjoy working with this team and knowing that together – we can and will deliver!\n\n106#You can’t get more “Live” than that!|Chris, Jeff, Jill - I’m so impressed with the leadership, speed and agility you’ve demonstrated to wrestle a plan for our first all digital WHL event to the ground. The campaign is of the moment relevant, the creative feels on brand fresh, and the determination of your efforts comes clearly through in the Day 1 results. Where others might say ten thousand what?! You’ve said - got it! ... And here’s the plan! Some folks see a countdown clock and say “yikes, pressure.” This group of event and marketing pros says, “pressure makes diamonds!” Excited to see this team shine bright like a diamond and be heads down on execution. Keep up the great work, and keep leading to show the impossible is possible! With gratitude, -C\n\n107#Making us stronger together - every single day|Team - what a week! I am blown away by your collective and individual innovation. These are the experiences that can give us the best learnings and insights - not only in terms of skills, but more important, learning just how much awesomeness we are capable of bringing to the world. Thank you. Onward!\n\n108#All systems go!|This group rallied mid week in an incredible pivot from soft launch to just LAUNCH within hours. I cannot thank you enough for the commitment to urgency for launching media campaigns.\n\n109#Some how you've got time for that.|Chris I’ve been in a handful of meetings with you over the past couple of weeks. In each one you’ve brought clarity and focus to the meeting. Thank you for not only taking the lead but bringing the team together on vision and purpose. I’m making this short cause you probably have 10 more meetings today.\n\n110#Doing in a day what takes most a month|Jess and Chris, thank you for taking on the CSR brand work with the sense of urgency and passion rarely witnessed.  With a sense of humor, humility, and an espirt des corps that was contagious. you created a look, feel, and message of beauty, grace, and humanity. Thank you for making this all happen overnight. Thank you for expertly walking each of us through your concepts and helping us create the world we want to live in: one that celebrates the heroes that are among us. You have inspired me to be better, be faster, be more grateful and never settle. Thank you.\n\n111#1-Day Branding|Guys, what can I say. This latest project for our amazing CSR healthcare push has been a flurry of activity! I'm grateful to you both for bringing me in early on this, because it has giving me better visibility to what it has taken to turn it around, but also because it will help inform how the team and I can roll this out as we go forward. That said, this award is for urgency, because I was truly impressed by the speed at which you both flew into action to deliver tangible assets for the teams to use. Jess, your overnight logo work paid off, and the look that we're going with is refreshing and positive. Chris, the rapid-fire headlines and lead copy really helped bring it all to life. Nice work, guys.\n\n112#ECD or... Recruiter???|Chris - the first time I hired for you I thought \"wow, that was easy\". Our search for a Senior Copywriter was so smooth, and largely because you were quick to respond, decisive, and proactive. This time, you went even further, and delivered a stellar candidate to me on a silver platter. What will you have up your sleeve next time? In all seriousness - thank you for tapping into your network, and quickly identifying an excellent candidate for our ACD opening. On top of it all, you were patient and understanding when we had to delay an offer to reevaluate hiring processes given the current unique situation we all find ourselves in. You are always thoughtful, respectful, understanding, and above all else, always a team player. THANK YOU!\n\n113#Re-tweet this!|Team - amazing job on the most recent Eric video. Wanted to recognize it and share this great compliment from our partners: \"Outrageously fab video re Eric about free offerings! Well done to all involved! EILEEN NOLAN VP, Strategic Accounts\" Keep it up. With gratitude, -C\n\n114#Leading by example|Chris, this probably isn't the first time I've titled an award to you like this. But I honestly don't know a more appropriate way to word it right now. I feel so privileged to work with someone of your caliber. You show us every day what it looks like to balance your compassion for your team, with the commitment to the quality of the work. Thats never an easy thing to do - and given our current world circumstances, its so much more challenging. Thank you for driving things forward; for openly collaborating and encouraging ideas; for understanding how & when to push/pull; for giving and receiving honest feedback, and helping the team grow.... and well, you know.... all the things.\n\n115#Microsite - oh my!|Thank you all for your patience and can-do attitude to get the new Teams microsite up and ready for launch! Was that a record 3 days? What a herculean effort, across teams, across the pond, early mornings and late nights and you all rallied to make it one of the best mini sites ever. The world will finally know what Workhuman can bring to humanity during this time of crisis and without this team effort, it never would have been possible. Thank you will all my heart!\n\n116#And Thank YOU, team!|I wanted to recognize you all for being a part of the amazing Healthcare Thank you Video we launched to our customers and social channels yesterday afternoon. This was both a great initiative to showcase our respect for our customers and all members in the healthcare industry, as well as such a great team collaboration. Each and every one of you played a crucial part in making this so successful.   I was personally excited and touched by this video since I have so many family members and close friends in the front lines, and I'm so excited to share with them to brighten their day!\n\n117#Who you are|I want to give a recognition for many reasons. Each of you has stepped up in an awesome way. From moving this ship in a proper direction to keeping all the teams informed. As I watch the local news I’m seeing people I may not know about step up and step into the uncharted waters that is covid-19. The thing is I know you all to some degree and now I am getting to see why you are at workhuman. You step up and step into all of this with a great attitude and a heart to let us all know to keep being human. From resources, to open lines of communication, you’ve each shown us how to lead with heart. Thanks so much for all you do! Also didn't realize I was going to go with the water analogies.\n\n118#Making it Happen for Healthcare!|Chris, thank you for partnering with me to deliver the video for healthcare workers!  I know that you have a trillion things on the go at the moment and when I came to you with this idea the last thing you needed was another project to squeeze into your already packed schedule!  You jumped on it with such enthusiasm and gusto and worked with me to tighten the timeline to deliver what we need in the shortest possible timeframe.  Thank you for always being open and honest about what is possible and achievable, for being flexible to find solutions and for remaining dedicated to finding the win-win without compromising quality!  You are a pleasure to work with and I want you to know that I appreciate you!  I am so excited to see how it comes together on Monday!  Have a lovely weekend!  Thank you!\n\n119#Is it still Wednesday?|Team -  First, thank you - often and always.  Second, I want to acknowledge we are operating in unprecedented times. This can trigger feelings of discomfort and anxiety if you let it. But, I believe we are strong enough together to rally, support, and mobilize each other to overcome that potential because you all as leaders already have. Know that every moment of progress you’ve made this week already illustrates your strength, determination, and grit.  In the broader context - none of us are guaranteed a tomorrow - COVID may exacerbate that mindset - but in reality this too shall pass and we all will be stronger from it - personally and professionally.  I believe in you. And I believe in us together. Our collective strengths to overcome and our true human spirit to persevere will best this.  I am honored to serve alongside you in the pursuit of our brand, our customers, and the greater community we serve.  Thank you for all your support, kindness, and compassion you've extended to me this week!  With gratitude, -C\n\n120#Seamless leadership|This is so overdue that it's shameful! You slipped in so seamlessly to the creative team that it feels like you've been here for a lifetime. I have a deep appreciation for the way you came in with patience and just observed the work without jumping in – it speaks to your skills not just as a creative but as a leader. So many creative (and noncreative!) people come into a new position and can't wait to put their own fingerprints all over the situation. You watched and waited and got to know the team so that you could figure out the gaps and how to move forward best. You came at the work with absolutely no ego, just a sincere desire to make great stuff. I am in love with the plan for the team that you've shared with us, it uses the best of the skills we already have and puts us in a position for steady growth. I joked with Jill K that if I didn't like the new guy they were bringing in to be my boss I'd petition for a full move over to the events team – but I'm pleased to say that working for you is fantastic and I'm happy to stay right where I am. It's great to have someone else who speaks \"agency\" and who can help re-center me on strategic creative. You bring so much to our narrative and I think our messaging will be stronger for it – I am looking forward to learning a lot from you!! I'm so glad you landed here!\n\n121#Everyone needs a rock...I've got a few!|Over the past few days, we've been working more closely together than ever before. Things are moving at a rapid pace, there's a constant fire hose of new ideas and projects, changing direction....plus the shared learning curve of how to be the most productive yet communicative and inclusive while we all embrace working remotely. It's been a roller coaster ride of emotions and I wanted you to know how grateful I am to be on this ride with you two. Thank you for being excellent strategic partners. In more ways than one, you've kept me sane - well, SOMEWHAT sane. ;-)\n\n122#A Message from Leadership on Video|Chris, Matt, & Owen, I wanted to share the shout out that Eric's video recently received. There is a Workhuman Live speaker who is a video aficionado. She shares stories of people who find passion and meaning in their work through a documentary series. On Friday, she wrote a blog post called \"A Message from Leadership on Video\" to explain how leaders can deliver a message on video in a human-centered way to connect, inform, and reassure their people. She referred to Eric's video as an example in the post of an \"authentic video message.\" Your thoughtful (and quick) work is being seen and appreciated by many. Thanks again.\n\n123#Ready and .... ACTION!|Team - Thank you for displaying a high level and high quality of urgency in getting the WHL-US video communication out today. This was a rapidly evolving situation. I want to recognize your great focus on the task at hand and the commitment to the business you all demonstrated to accomplish this critically important and time-sensitive communication. Getting it done today also helps create space in the market for next week so we balance the amount and type of messages we release to our customers and our salesforce. Thank for all you've done and in doing so with a level of grace and calm that is a positive influence. With gratitude, -C\n\n124#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n125#Career page dedication|Team- you’ve been cranking out a lot of great work on phase 1 of the career’s page update. The initial ask was to find a place to house some videos. When you started to look at the page, you noticed a few areas of improvement that’ll really make an impact on anyone looking to find out more about who we are and what we do! You thought about the content and creative in a global and usability-friendly way! You re-jiggered the order on the page to make for a smoother experience. Not only that, but you thought ahead to phase 2 and shared ideas for new ways to explain social recognition that nobody has thought of before! Thank you all for your individual efforts to really push the brand forward and think outside the box! We’re not done yet, but I wanted to recognize each of you, because I see the passion you have to make this section of our website really speak to our culture!\n\n126#Team Corona|Coronavirus.  Covid-19.  A giant headache.  We all call it something different – especially because the situation with it has been changing minute by minute and making our decision making process so challenging.  When we made the decision to create new content and FAQ’s for our Workhuman Live site and audiences at 8PM on a Friday night, I crossed my fingers we would be able to activate.  We needed to get information out to our audiences that was clear, consistent, and valuable to ensure they felt informed and at ease.  No surprise – every single one of you stepped up.  Dianne was slacking me almost immediately with project set-up details and timelines.  Lauren had copy in my hands before 6:00 AM (you actually sent it at 1:30!?!)  Chris and Amy were both there to review, edit and get on the phone to talk it through.  Jon had site pages staged and new pop-up functionality built and staged Saturday morning.  Jen and Anthony had layouts and content ready to deploy.  Jill was providing copy strategy and reviews.  Holly and Anne were standing by ready to act as needed for our audiences.  And Lauren – our guiding light and champion of strategy supporting the whole process was as responsive as ever with reviews and feedback.  This is such an evolving and fluid situation, but the team never ceases to amaze me.  You gave up family and weekend time to help ensure our customers had the information they needed, when they needed it.  Your continued dedication and respect for customers, urgency, quality, and teamwork is amazing.  Thank you – and Cheers to Team Corona.\n\n127#Quick Video Turnarounds|Thanks guys for the quick turnaround on today's video shoot. And thank you for coming into the office and spending the day there working on these videos. They both look great, what a fantastic background! With everything happening out there, speed and agility becomes even more important, and you guys just mobilized and got it done!  And if anyone asks, I was not standing on a box!\n\n128#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n129#Last minute ask|On top of your day jobs, I asked each of you to present in our weekly marketing directors+ meeting today - without a ton of notice. You produced slides, shared great content, and kept the team engaged during your sessions. Thank you for embracing the new format for our weekly meeting which we tried for the first time today, and contributing to what felt like one of our best meetings to date!\n\n130#Humans Unite!|Team - I wanted to recognize a tremendous display of urgency, creativity, and teamwork to overhaul the existing creative approach for WHL audience acquisition and event campaigns. In just 48 hours (and I think you used all of those hours ;), you responded to our call to action and put forward a compelling, thoughtful, hard hitting, and provocative new approach to this campaign. I believe it will help us meet our goals, and provide a whole new influencing lens on the broader suite of marketing and brand elements we go to market with. From the stat + fact formula powered by WorkHuman IQ \"3-ups\", to the big, bold, palettes and voice shared ... our fellow humans will definitely not want to be a \"Mo\" come May 11th. Thank you for the hard work, quick action, and hyper-focus that generated very exciting and high quality creative. Keep it coming! With gratitude, -C\n\n131#Shoutout to all my Saucy Aunts|Thank you all so much for bringing great energy, enthusiasm, and attention to the kickoff with Influitive! This was a true cross-functional effort with representation from CX, CS, Strategy and Consulting, Marketing, Sales Operations, and Design – an awesome demonstration of the power of collaboration. As we heard, even our Influitive consultant was impressed with how much involvement we had. You all brought unique perspectives on how we can engage with and deliver value to our customers through this community platform. I’m still riding the wave of excitement coming from our kickoff and am so excited to engage with each of you further in executing on the strategy we developed together. And not only were we productive, but we got to have some fun in there too ?. I’m so grateful to work alongside each and every one of you. Looking forward to the amazing things to come!\n\n132#Constructs for success|A few weeks ago we took on a herculean task, gathering a small cross-functional team to create a rubric for consistent messaging heading into 2020. 19 core narratives, from themes to products, and the building began. Each of you played a part, both large and small and we are off to a such a strong start! Next steps are culling these down even more to get them over the finish line but I couldn’t have done any of this without your help and support. GO TEAM!\n\n133#Feedback|Chris - I really appreciate your feedback. I know these requests can be a lot and are time consuming. Your feedback will be a tremendous help for me as we continue to grow and our partnership gets strong. Thank you!\n\n134#What it means to Work ... human!|Tyler, Jess, Chris, Kevin - Thank you for being open, welcoming, transparent and supportive toward me during my transition to WH. Individually and collectively you've sought out ways to build collaboration and an open dialogue with me. You've helped ground me in our shared goals and been open-minded to my ideas and approaches while staying focused on the priorities of the business. It's a powerful team dynamic you've unlocked - one that truly compels proactive-ness, engagement, and a safe-space for ideas, risks, and each of our unique backgrounds, perspectives, ideas and views. I can feel the momentum building for us together and look forward to doing great things together for our brand, our customers, and the wider world of work! A great example of what it means to Work ... human. With gratitude, -C\n\n135#Ignite US 2020|Huge thank you to all of you for every part you played in this years US Ignite!  Content, speaker requests, dry runs.  Fresh new design for Ignite and getting all the creative requests through.  Activations for attendees to take part in, possibly seeing a small sneak peek of what might be seen at this years WHL.  Video's, opening videos, traveling out of country to make videos!  Walk in music, imbedding videos into presentations, adjusting presentations, walk out music, directing PSAV crew onsite.  WH Gives coordination, helping out at registration getting badges and jackets out.  Setting up and breaking down back drops and activations as well as setting up and breaking down for the gold party.  Coordinating signups for breakouts and dine arounds, changing reservations up to the last minute.  Filling your cars with all the items that needed to get there and then filling them again to get them back to the office so they can be prepared to travel across the pond.  Having a smile on your face, answewring many questions, getting plenty of steps in\n\n136#Neon for days!|Creative geniuses, the design of this years Ignite was simply stunning. It was bright, colorful, purposeful and exciting! The way you carried through the entire concept from the opening video, the Workhuman Cloud icons, to the lanyards was superb. There is so much effort that goes into all the details that truly made this special. You are a dream creative force, I'm incredibly proud of you all.\n\n137#Team 12: Brainstormin' with the BEST!|I want to thank you all for such a successful brainstorm session at Ignite! It was great having people from different teams come together to share ideas. First, it was nice to be in a smaller group of humans and get to meet some new friends. And it was so fun hearing about everyone's first job - we even had a nautical theme among the group. Then we dove into the brainstorm piece and the ideas were flowing. Everyone gets an A+ for participation, too! It is not always easy to share with people you just met, but this was not a challenge at all. Thanks for letting me brainstorm with the best!\n\n138#A Good Night with a Few Good Men...|Amidst the blur of the pace of life, it is always nice to slow life down for a bit and connect about the ties that bind and the moments that really matter-and in the process learn something that you would not have otherwise known. Thank you for the honor and privilege of your company and for the camaraderie that will not end just because our dinner did.\n\n139#HIRED!|Chris - congratulations on your new Sr Copywriter! This was such a seamless process on my end, hugely because of your partnership. Following a great kick off meeting, you were super responsive and communicative, and made yourself available for interviews. You were open minded to the profiles I was sending and the people we were considering. Not to mention, you drove away from home back to the office after Ignite ended to just for Owen's interview. I'm so glad it all worked out - and think that Owen is going to do great under your phenomenal leadership. Congrats again, and thank you for being such a great recruiting partner!\n\n140#Being Human|One of my favorite parts of our yearly Ignite program is the dine arounds. It’s a chance to spend time with our fellow humans in an informal setting, with no rush, no pressure, just humans connecting. Last night, this paid off in spades. I want to say a heartfelt “thank you” to each one of you for being your authentic self! I loved the free-flowing conversations we had, the opportunity to learn more about each one of you, to share our similarities, and to find out what makes each of us unique. It’s experiences like this that make me proud to work with all of you at Workhuman.\n\n141#Ignite Keynote|Many thanks to you all, especially you Jen, for the work you did on the Ignite Keynote! Always amazing to see how it comes together in the end. Never doubted it for a second (cough, cough!). It's always a high stakes project, and one where we set the bar absurdly high. I enjoyed presenting it and believe we now have at least half the Workman Live keynote! A lot of creative minds and produce great things. Now onward to Dublin and San Antonio! Thank You!\n\n142#Amazing Partner and Voice of Reason|Chris, I feel like your wisdom and workhumany-ness spans years and haven't you been here a hot minute?! Seriously, you have been a wonderful partner. I enjoy collaborating with you, talking about strategy, tactics, the future of marketing, and how to tackle keeping projects moving and productive. Thank you for being a great listener and being so focused on relationships; so many super things ahead and couldn't be more thrilled to have you on the team leading that charge. Cheers to you!\n\n143#Knocked it out of the park!|Chris, Maureen, Lauren, and James - Your JetBlue 1M Recognition for the Customer Experience team was so fantastic, each approach that you presented was better than the previous one and leaving everyone to say they loved them all! This was my first creative brainstorm/pitch project since I've started and this really brought me back to my agency days with the level of creative juices you presented us. Job well done, I can't wait to see how this moment for JetBlue comes to life and I'm so excited to work with you guys on all future projects, a job well done!\n\n144#Mucho Respect|Chris - there is an inside joke that I am a bit of a stickler when it comes to giving recognition. But, as I shut down for the holidays, I thought about the past few months of your time here and the impact we already feel on the team.  The Respect for All award is definitely one of the most elusive awards given at WH, but when I take a step back and think about the projects you jumped into, the broad group of folks you collaborate with, and your graceful and expert management of new and old perspectives - you demonstrate this behavior every day.  I speak for many on the team in that we are grateful for your perspective, support, and leadership.  Looking forward to the new year and staying on that upward learning curve.\n\n145#Off to a great start!|Chris, we've only worked together for a few weeks now, but it feels like it's been for years! I've forgotten how much fun it is to work with a conceptual 'copy-guy'. We've had a lot of laughs, shared stories, and even had some spirited and respectful debates. All this is setting us up for great success in the future. I truly appreciate how we are able to talk openly and candidly about the great successes we've had and the opportunities ahead. Coming into this organization can be challenging for sure, as there is such a significant learning curve, yet you are taking it all in stride. You joining came at the most perfect time as we ramp up all the 2020 initiatives fast and furiously. These will take a village and I'm thrilled to work with you on this next phase of the Workhuman journey.\n\n146#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n147#Kicking off strong!|Chris, thank you for such a great Job Kickoff meeting today! I'm so excited to work with you as a hiring manager, after having worked with you on the candidate side. I really appreciate the brainstorming session we had, and your willingness to be an active partner in this search process. I'm really looking forward to hiring for your team!\n\n148#Keeping the business moving forward|Jess & Chris - I can't say thank you enough for spending an hour with me on a Friday afternoon to bring to life the weirdness that is in my brain. It's all there but not cohesive or pretty. You both put in an extra amount of effort to bring that out in a way that I know is going to align the team and MOVE THE BUSINESS FORWARD. I am grateful for you both.\n\n149#Lee-der of the pack|Chris, since the first creative meeting you held, it was clear that your fresh approach, egoless demeanor, and breadth of experience were going to infuse new life into the company and expand the scope of what we do and how we put the brand out there. And while you haven’t been here long, you’ve already managed to make many marks with your creative oversight of initiatives already underway like the gratitude and healthcare campaigns, as well as your day-to-day leadership of Creative. I feel truly supported and I’ve loved collaborating with you on copy. I’m excited to learn from you and for all the awesome things to come. Grateful that you’re here!\n\n150#Defining Success|Chris, Jen, and Maureen - I want to thank you all for the thoughtful approach you took to looking at the creative team structure. You all went above and beyond the ask to create a vision for the team that can leverage each team members unique skills. In the middle of all of the day to day work that each of you has on their plate, you took time to meet, discuss, and effectively communicate a plan that will provide clarity and a path for growth on the team. Gratitudes all around!\n\n151#Quality vs Quantity|Chris, without any hesitation you jumped into a couple projects we’ve been struggling to kickoff. You shared your unique perspective in a respectful way, offering your take and ideas to really push forward our brand and messaging. This will help drive consistency to our audiences so they will begin to recognize who we are and what we do! This is so important. While we’ve been in a rush to get things out into the world, your feedback will ensure the quality is there. Thanks for being available to walk through several projects as soon as you hit your desk each morning this week! Happy to be your neighbor and talk this out together!\n\n"
