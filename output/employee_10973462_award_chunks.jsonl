"0#Q1 QBRs: a Fresh New Year!|A 2 week-er! As we 'wrap up' QBRs for the first quarter of 2022, I want to thank you for your deep discovery work and preparation. We started with a week long deep dive account by account to get us all level set on our current footing. It was a very intense week and I so appreciate you all being so prepared and professional! We then gathered in my city by the Bay for another few days of collaboration, ideation, and BIG idea sharing. What a fantastic few days! Thank you for your commitment to this process, for showing up with your whole selves, for being supportive and encouraging of each other, and for making me laugh so much. I'm so proud of the work we're doing together and always SO happy to see you all in person. (I'm also super grateful that Erika's house is Covid-free! We missed your presence physically but we felt your presence virtually!) Safe travels home and happy weekend! #bestteamevah\n\n1#The BEST team on the Planet!|You all are a team of fierce, focused and determined humans!  I am so thankful to have a front row seat to watch you pouring your heart into all that you do to support our customers and grow the business for Workhuman.  Each of you inspires me beyond measure.  The work you all do everyday is challenging and hard and you make it look effortless.  You are truly moving mountains and I couldn't be more proud of you all. Thank you for being uniquely you!\n\n2#And, we're off!|This team had one heck of a year and they're already out of the starting gate to take on 2022! We're 14 days in and I am so inspired by the determination and planning that has lead to a LOT of strategic meetings already. We've already closed 2 more huge customers on the Inclusion Advisor, have Gratitude Summits underway---and a backlog of demand!, and have identified major opportunities with steps toward closing them. Congratulations on a great start to a fresh new year. Please hydrate!\n\n3#A little goes a long way.....|Martin - thanks so much for jumping on an ask I had about a mutual connection at a prospect I am working with. From this email, we were able to understand that WH is still on NFI's radar, and we can continue the work at a high level to ensure we answer any and all questions. Appreciate you jumping all over this at a moment's notice, thank you Martin!\n\n4#Bring on 2022!|What a group of inspirational and determined people all of you are!  In our time together this week at our QBRs, we focused on our vision and commitment to success in 2022.  I was blown away by the commitment and passion each of you demonstrated to continue to drive for the very best experience for our customers.  That in turn means, we will be driving for the very best for Workhuman.  2021 has been a challenging year in so many ways, both personally and professionally for each of you and the grit and fortitude you all demonstrate on a daily basis is unparalleled.  You all have blown your Moonshots out of the water and have continued to drive this business forward against many challenges.  The integrity and spirit of delivering the best experience for our customers, their culture and their employees is what continues to drive our success here as we continue to see more recognition happening at our largest customers.  You all are the lifeblood and I’m so proud to work alongside each of you.  Cheers!\n\n5#Thankful for You|This is the time of year where everyone is rushing toward the 'finish line'--literally pushing themselves and each other toward another year of record breaking performance. It's the crush of renewal season, always a bit stressful and uncertain until the deals are done. Thank you for hanging in there for each other and acting with integrity and professionalism. I'm so thankful to work with each of you! Wishing you a beautiful long weekend with your family and friends. On to December! Gobble Gobble!\n\n6#A very special moment that matters|Team! Thank you all for your participation in our special retirement book and gift for Diane Abbriano at New York Life.  Diane has been a long standing champion of Workhuman and will be retiring at the end of this week.  Diane brought the Applause program to life and has been overseeing the program for over 6 years.  Huge shout out to the experience team (Chris, Amanda and Meghan) for the amazing idea and bringing it to life!  We gathered messages from Workhuman colleagues that have worked with Diane over the years as well as internal New York Life team members to create a special send off to this next exciting chapter of retirement!  Here is the note from Diane after receiving the gift: Thank you for the most thoughtful gift!  It was a nice surprise.  Actually, it was more than nice, it was amazing.  I have received many letters of congratulations and some beautiful gifts, but I couldn’t wait to share this book with my family because it was so heartfelt and personal.  From the first time I met with Tom Vitkofsky, Workhuman became part of my extended work family.  I could not have launched Applause and made it a success if it weren’t for Lynette, Mark, Chris, Lauren, Sheri, Martin and the rest of the Workhuman superstars who were always there to support us.  Please pass along my thanks to this terrific group of humans! --- This clearly made an impact and it would not have been as meaningful without all of your help and participation, thank you!\n\n7#Bursting with Gratitude!|To this magnificent group of remarkable leaders, I wanted to share with you the gratitude I feel for all of you every single day.  Each of you brings a unique point of view and inspiring ways you’re leading our customers into the future.  I can’t imagine this journey without any of you.  My heart is overflowing with gratitude that I get the opportunity to work alongside you, learn from you, laugh with you, swear with you and be inspired by you.  Never have I ever worked with a more talented group of humans.  Thank you for being you!!!\n\n8#Gratitude for your FIRE!|To this incredible team of pros, I hope you are dancing alongside me (virtually) to our theme song! You are the Fire in the band! How lucky are we all to work together and make work for millions of people centered in gratitude?! I'm grateful for each of you every day and inspired by your passion, drive, and leadership. Dance a little, sing a little, and feel celebrated---Never was a cloudy day!\n\n9#Transforming the Future|This team is beyond INCREDIBLE and the TRUE DREAM TEAM!  As I think about the future of where Workhuman is going and the experiences we are working diligently to create in partnership with our customers, knowing all of you are leading the way makes me beyond proud.  We spent an incredible couple of days together leveraging our 'Empire State of Strategic Minds\" and worked with determination and passion to identify, align and set a path forward for what is next, how to get there, and take us well beyond a $1B company during our QBR session.  The level of strategic thinking, passion and determination you all demonstrated was truly inspiring.  The transformative strategy you all have outlined is what is going to move us forward in all the best ways with focus on our customers digital transformation, sustainability, agility, inclusion and equity efforts and beyond.  I can’t wait to see where the vision takes this team and the relationships you have built. Amazing work team!\n\n10#What slowdown?|Team fab. Every week I read your Strategic Insights and am blown away. It's actually a challenge to summarize the incredible work you are doing. Week after week, you are outdoing yourselves. The work that is happening today is work that we were only dreaming about a few years ago! You are truly setting a new bar weekly for us and forcing us to think bigger and bigger as an organization. Thank you for the work you are doing daily, conversation to conversation, meeting to meeting, internally and externally to make incredible things happen. And it's not just the work with customers, the collaboration and teamwork that you demonstrate every day makes me super proud. Thank you and Bravo!\n\n11#Integrating me to the SCD Team!|One month in and I have had such productive one on one conversations with each of the broader SCD team including also Traci and Becky.  Thank you to everyone for being such a productive, positive and meaningful addition to my onboarding.  There is so much to learn from all of  you and I am so thrilled to be a part of this team.  Thanks for leaning in and helping me get up to speed!\n\n12#Valuable Feedback|I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for taking the time to join my Roundtable session to introduce yourselves and spend sometime providing me with helpful context and feedback about your time at Workhuman - everything you shared was very helpful for me learning the business and looking for areas to quickly add value. I so look forward to our continued partnership!\n\n13#Politely shoving a shoulder through the door jam|Mahty, the biggest of shout outs to you as our PwC Head Sherpa. You have been through so many sticky situations with PwC in the past several months, maybe equally as challenging as our current situation, yet you seem to be politely, professionally, and very personally absolutely killing them with your steady hand. Our battle may be heating up but I feel like you're just getting warmed up. Thank you for your tireless work to move the team, both internally and externally, towards our continued partnership and to getting what's at the heart of their very solvable  'problems'. Optimism and ferocious teamwork will get us there. Until the battle is won, know that you're doing an excellent job leading the customer toward the light. Thank you!\n\n14#2H Global Marketing Plans|Team, I just wanted to thank everyone for their hard work and input on our 2H 2021 global marketing plans. I really appreciated all the thoughtful feedback and help along the way, very excited to get these into action!\n\n15#Taking time for Discovery!|All! Thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy days to participate in discovery calls for the customer database growth and governance project. Everyone offered terrific perspective and helped the team get a well rounded view of the current process and areas or opportunity. Excited to share the findings more broadly and appreciate you all!\n\n16#Global Account QBRs—Synergies!|Super excited after our two day meeting (i mean, with the time change, it was days right?)! You all brought your A game and applied the WH ‘MRI’ machine (T Pesch trademark) to our 6 biggest opportunites. We have so much great trouble to get into! Thank you for your energy, professionalism, creativity, ... but mostly for your teamwork and collaboration. I love this oportunity we have to focus and drive big growth.  The impact to the business is gonna be huuuuuge. Bravo!\n\n17#Making Sparks Fly|Huge THANK YOU to all of you for an incredible Quarterly Business Meeting today!  We could have spent the entire 3 hours celebrating all of the amazing work you all are doing. You all are the visionaries leading our customers into the Future of Work and helping them to build cultures that celebrate their employees.  The work you’re doing is fundamentally inspiring employees to feel valued, included and recognized for their contributions and unique perspectives.  As we continue to drive towards our goals for the second half of the year, I am certain we will continue to make sparks fly in all the right ways.  Your dedication and passion for the work we do is unprecedented and so evident in all you deliver.  I continue to be blown away by the talent each of you bring and can’t thank you enough for everything you do to support our customers.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n18#Making Great Impressions all over the place!|Marty – The work you’re doing to strategically move the relationships at Lockheed and Citi is truly remarkable!  You’ve absolutely rocked these two big meetings that involved some tough conversations with your professionalism and grace.  These conversations tend to take the most finesse and \"just rightness\" to deliver a successful outcome.  You did an incredible job coordinating and planning with your internal partners to position the conversations just right in order to set the tone and build trust.  Marty, quite simply, you’re calm, cool and collected at all times and that is so admired.\n\n19#Successful annual review with Lockheed Martin|Team, great job on the marathon 3-hour call for the Lockheed Martin annual review today. Their team is laser-focused and they thanked us multiple times for covering such a wide range of topics they wanted to learn more about. Lockheed has very high expectations and you all knocked it out of the park! Marty, you kicked us off by acknowledging the areas where they wanted to focus on but also opening their eyes to other opportunities like DEI, examining performance and recognition and how they intersect and the list goes on! Sarah, you presented our e-comm updates and acknowledged the challenges all supply chains and merchants are having masterfully. You counteracted some resistance from their VP about the value of the program like the boss that you are. I’m so grateful the Lockheed team got to hear from you! It went a long way in their understanding of the vision and how we are doing our best to build a best-in-class redemption experience powered by fun and choice. Isha, despite literal alarms going off at your house literally minutes before you presented you did an amazing job walking the team through the measurable impact of recognition. Thank you for being so detailed and thoughtful in your prep for this meeting, great job! Thanks again, everyone!\n\n20#Always Ready!|Congrats and well done to this powerhouse team of Strategic Leaders on a blowout Q1! Your hard work and always ready mentality has proven to be our secret weapon. Every week I see you making major chess moves with our Strategic Accounts and teeing us up to win big. So many congratulations on the first of many successful quarters in 2021. Super proud of each of you and your new fabulous leader! Rock on!\n\n21#A Team Appreciation Day!|Happiest Employee Appreciation Day to this team of badasses! I could not be prouder to work with such a team of professionals. You make work fun! You show up every day, leaning in, supporting each other, raising the bar, and celebrating every moment along the way. I hope you feel the love every day but especially today! Thank you for being such great caretakers of our mission and leaders for the organization. Strategic Client Directors lead the way!\n\n22#Visibility 2021|It's February 18! We're almost halfway through the quarter! What a whirlwind 2021 has been. Thanks to this team of inspired minds for coming together this week to review detailed individual action plans for our strategic accounts and also coming together to share our biggest opportunities with each other. We all learn and grow so much together and I LOVE IT! Special shout out to our new BFF, Yuri! Thanks so much for kicking us off, inspiring our thinking, introducing us to the best new yogi 2021, and giving us some insight and vision for the future of WHCE. We're so lucky to have you! Thanks to everyone on the team for contributing to our Periscope project and Data Insights project. We've made some real progress on ass kicking and it's 'only' February! I see you!\n\n23#Wednesday night Zoom-around|Thanks everyone for showing up and contributing to a warm, fun and insightful zoom-around on Wednesday.  Not the same as an in-person conversation, of course but i really enjoyed spending some work-free time with you.  I hope you enjoyed listening and contributing to the 2 lies and 1 truth game we played .... never ceases to amaze me what stories we all have to tell and share.\n\n24#Team Award Communication Flows & Up-Dates!|All, Just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for keeping operations up to speed on the Team Awards initiative during 2020. It has been an exceptional year on many fronts, and the team awards have contributed greatly to the continued success we are experiencing during Q4. Many, Many Company records have been broken in the recent weeks.. from Highest Value of Non Cash Awards in a week, Highest number of orders in a week, Highest number of shipments in a week, Highest number of customer contacts in a week...the list goes on! YOUR notification of the various client team awards and continued communication (or answering my questions! :) ) on when the award was going to happen, what countries were in scope, what value was the award, was SOLI a factor, who was the message from within the client company, do they have amazon,  what would the message say, how many HUMANS would be receiving a well deserved moment of recognition etc... It really does take a village! Your support and willingness to provide as much detail as possible on the team awards, was exceptionally useful during recent week's. The communication flow enabled us to plan resources and inventory levels accordingly, helped us to get the right information to the right teams at the right time, enabling us to continue to deliver an exceptional employee experience globally...while records continued to been broken on a daily basis! Thanks again for your support, Roll on 2021! Enjoy!\n\n25#Ready for a New Year!|Thanks to this very focused team of experts and leaders for creating something out of the tough 'hand' 2020 dealt us. Through all we've maneuvered through, I've consistently heard nothing but determination, strength, support for each other and for others, and a fierceness to overcome that is burned in my memory forever. As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking. Spending as much time as possible making things happen leaves little time for planning so all the more impressive how thoroughly you prepared to review action plans for each of your accounts. Thanks to our badass team of magicians, Traci and Rebecca for helping me pull off one of our greatest QBRs to date. Cheers to you all and to many more years of success together! You are all the magic of Christmas!\n\n26#Pushing PWC across the finish line|Tim & Marty, I wanted to recognize you both for the incredible work you've dedicated to PWC and their program over the past 8 months.  Back in February when the world was much different the PWC team had to make some larger program decisions pausing their program due to tax implications.  This set us on a path working to solution how we can address their tax concerns and bring their program back to life.  Then the world stopped with COVID which had larger implications on PWC and their business.  Fast forward to Q4 and conversations with their program leaders brought us to a place where they were ready to start putting the program back in motion, which led to put it mildly some interesting procurement conversations around a new contract.  This required a ton of different conversations with their procurement and program leaders to get us all to a place where they extended their agreement with Workhuman. Marty, thank you for leading all of those intense conversations and getting us on this path forward.  Finally this set the wheels in motion to start the configuration work for their program relaunch which is very unique compared to any of our other customers.  Tim, thank you so much for managing all of this work with a countless number of others along the way.  You were the direct voice back to the program team running through all their test scenarios, configuration changes, troubleshooting and ultimately managing the customer over the implementation process.  Tim and Marty, as a result of both of our efforts a top customer is back up and running and already pushing a significant number of awards through their program.  I can't thank you enough for the amazing work you've done here with PWC!\n\n27#Grateful for the 'A' Team|Sending a heartfelt moment of thanks to this team of fierce friends. 2020 has been a test in many ways. The one thing that it has cemented for me is that the bonds that we make over time are clearly revealed in times of struggle. Thank you for your unwavering support of each other and the business through these many, many months of stress and hard work. Wishing each of you a day of rest and some time to reflect on your achievements thus far. I continue to be inspired by you and by the possibilities you see in yourselves and each other!\n\n28#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n29#Getting PWC Back On Track|Guys - After spending more than 5 years from my first meeting to getting PWC to finally sign and launch it was a saddening event when they decided to shut down their program for Covid.  I know it was a gut punch for you both as well but I also know that you have been working harder than ever to get them back up and running.  Even though that effort still has a couple more yards to the end zone I want to say thanks for all of the effort that you have put in to this point.  The journey will make the accomplishment even greater and once again PWC employees will know they are truly valued and thanked!  Keep it up but so well done to this point!\n\n30#Coming together for Citi|The biggest thank you to this team for coming together to get an impressive RFP response out to Citi. All of you pitched in under some real time pressure and over the weekend to put our best efforts forward. The biggest of shout outs and undying praise to our fearless leader, Michael, who spent the majority of his weekend committed to getting this undertaking under control! We’re all so fortunate to work with such great colleagues. Thank you all so much!\n\n31#Doing the dirty work|Let's face it, data clean up is no fun.  But, it's worth it!  Thank you for taking time out of your insane schedules to comb through data, find missing pieces and populate our tracker.  Becasue of your efforts we'll be able to get this into a centralized place - allowing us to work smarter and faster from here on out.  Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and getting it done!\n\n32#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n33#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n34#Client partnership at its finest!|Sophia and Marty, thank you so much for amazing work you've been doing with the Lockheed team and program.  We were dealt with a unique issue this week that required initially some internal investigative work on our side followed by positioning things back to the Program Manager.  This involved strategizing around our proper talk tracks and helping the Lockheed team understand we have their best interests at heart.  You both jumped right into this situation and helped ensure we had all the proper context for the client conversation, knowing there were likely 25 other things going on in your day.  The preparation was so evident as the conversation with the customer went extremely well.  So good that the Program Manager called out the amazing work you've been doing with the program along with a shout out to you Sophia coming back from maternity leave and not missing a beat.  This is the second time in less than 2 months that Jill Ruff has recognized your specifically and all the incredible things you're doing with this tough customers.  Thank you both for your partnership, steady hands, calm but focused approach with our clients.\n\n35#UHG Support|Marty, this is overdue, but I wanted to say thank you for your support and partnership with UHG. There were a number of operational items that were thrown our way recently and I appreciate your willingness to step in, bring internal teams together where needed, and take the lead on moving these items forward. With fires seemingly coming at us from all directions and from multiple customers at times, you have a great ability to just take a step back, gather all information and come up with a plan to solve the problem...all while staying calm and collected. I really appreciate your partnership in righting the ship here and thanks for all your help.\n\n36#The Two Day ZoomBR Bonfire!|Thanks to this amazing team for two days (well, half days) of inspired thinking and planning in preparation for an amazing 2nd Half! As much as we missed the personal interaction and late nights, we managed to reconnect in a way that we really haven't been able to pull off in a few months! Special shout out to our Queen, Traci Pesch! She really knows how to inspire, engage, and fan the flames of success! Between Traci and Rebecca's creative minds we've got a great plan to find s'more ways to connect and create incredible experiences for our customers! And, looky here, we've got ourselves a marketing team! Thanks ever so much to the gods who sent us our fierce team in customer marketing, represented with the incredible Kristen G! A thoughtful, workable plan to bring our friends into the many cool streams happening in marketing. And lastly, thanks to all of you badass SCDs, always bringing the big ideas, shaking things up, pushing beyond your comfort zones and helping our customers do the same! I'm humbled and impressed every day to get to work with such a powerful group of people who do nothing but cheer each other on! Let's go light this thing up!\n\n37#A Magical Moment for a Lifetime Advocate|What a team effort this was!  Creating a special moment memorializing our partnership with a lifetime advocate who is retiring is no small feat – especially when that advocate is the former CHRO of UHG!  This team demonstrated, imagination, determination, innovation, respect, and resilience!  I am so proud of the finished product and each of you played a critical part!  Amanda S, the master conductor, driving the project forward with such passion, determination and energy that is your unique gift to the world that we get to see in action every day here at Workhuman! Christina, keeping us all aligned and on track through the many stops and starts as we weaved in and out of competing priorities, Kevin, bringing our vision to life so expertly and with such positivity and creativity, Lauren B, your genius penmanship that hardly generated a tweak from your original recommendations for messages to capture the essence of the memories, Amanda G and Lauren G for helping us craft the timeline of engagements with associated assets to reflect our collection of memories proudly, Eileen, Traci, Jay, Mark and Marty for reviewing the messages and stats to be sure we accurately reflected the UHG story with the appropriate tone and positioning that would resonate with Ellen and make her proud!  Team, job well done!  Theresa shared that Ellen had received the book and “absolutely loved it”.  Thank you for creating a special moment for a special lifetime advocate!  Great teamwork!\n\n38#What sets us apart|Amazing job creating this beautiful life event to celebrate the wedding of Karen Sachs at UHG! Marty, no opportunity big or small sneaks past you! You knew we could integrate our product and humans into this moment and impact our relationship with Karen in a meaningful way. Kelsey, you did a phenomenal  job running point on resources and details to create perfection. What \"vendor\" creates a personalized moment to celebrate someones wedding? We do! We aren't a vendor - we are a partner fueled by passionate, caring humans like you both. Things like this will always set us apart from the rest. Karen will no doubt remember this always when she reflects back to her wedding. Great job!!\n\n39#Wow|Team, I was reviewing all of your progress updates for top accounts early this morning and I have to say that the work this team is doing is fantastic.  So many different variables are involved in these huge, complex accounts but each of you is on top of your accounts in such a strategic way.  Whether it is new growth in thriving accounts like bulk uploads, new sales incentive programs and retirement/milestone awards or just the right amount of surrounding for those accounts in temporary suspension.  This \"in the trenches\" work is so critical to the health and growth of both our business and the lives of the employees at your customers.  They need it more than ever right now.  Bravo and well done!  And special call out to your fearless leader Eileen who is leading from the front with a huge dose of imagination and determination.  Happy Monday!\n\n40#Thanks for the support|Martin, just want to take a moment to recognize your support. you utilized your contact in Citi and with that we have been given more information around an issue in 2 days than the previous 2 months, all positive information too! goes to show that we are all one team here to help each other toward the end goal! CASH!!!\n\n41#Dream Team|I just want to take this moment to pay homage to this team of fierce, talented leaders for their focus and resilience during what is sure to go down in history as one of the most stressful times in world history. It's been quite an experience for each of us during this pandemic both from the work perspective and the 'outside of work' perspective. Each of you has been laser focused on the opportunity this situation created for our business and each of you have created opportunities out of this situation for the business! I'm so humbled by the never-quit mentality that you have lead with and continue to lead with in this environment. The impact you have made on our business at this moment is astounding. Thank you for the sacrifices, determination, support for each other, humor, and grace you have shown these past few months. It's pure joy to work with you!\n\n42#Breaking through at Abbott|This massive shout out goes to Marty, Mark, and the OG Traci P for all of the work, year upon year, month upon month, week upon (you get it...)...that feels more like a grind. I knew you were breaking through several weeks ago, when their CHRO actually 'read' a communication from \"Eric\" and then SENT IT TO her program manager with the \"find out more about this\" message. Sometimes it's these little but giant moves that indicate a subtle but important shift in direction. So, can you imagine my delight when I heard that they were 'interested in taking advantage of our bulk upload special pricing'? (I know you can...because you could hear me screaming from SF!) Although it is our good friend Gail P behind this issuance this time, i have no doubt that she's planting a giant seed for all of us within 'the house'---setting an example for her HR Leadership to think of Abbott Excellence in the way it is meant to be leveraged. SO many congrats to each of you for all the work that you are doing every single day to influence decision makers and inspire 'new' ideas for this very important customer. Today, a million dollar decision, tomorrow who knows what's possible! Bravo!\n\n43#Shining on Lockheed NextGen|Team- Thank you so much for all of your hard work on the Lockheed Martin Account Review. Fitting in an on site full day meeting into 3 and a half hour virtual meeting is definitely not an easy feat while making sure to hit on some key items that we wanted to talk through as well as what the client wanted to see, but this team was up to the challenge! To receive compliments from Jill at Lockheed like the ones below shows the great team work among everyone. There are a lot of great opportunities on this account, and I look forward to our continued partnership to drive these. From Jill's mouth: •\tMarty – you are a natural facilitator – great transitions, and somehow you kept us on schedule •\tGreg – Your metrics were insightful - would be interested in seeing some of those trends more regularly. •\tMelanie – you consistently bring fresh ideas, looking forward to exploring the Welcome Award option. •\tRick – Thank you for the specific product examples of price improvement. We would be interested in seeing more of those specific examples as the vendor expansion project matures. •\tErin – Looking forward to partnering on the User Engagement functionality enhancements, including learning more about the maturity of the Outlook Integration option.  Awesome work team!!\n\n44#Team PaulMartin|Has it really been a year? Who knew that after what seemed like a year's search, we'd actually find TWO new team members last year to start at almost the same time and become BFFs in a matter of months? What an incredible experiment! Each of you has brought new perspective and master level skills to the team and they have certainly being deployed at a rapid pace. SInce the moment you each took over your portfolio of accounts, you dove in with great confidence and got down to business. I'm sure you both feel like 10 year veterans at this point in time! Who knew the universe would throw us such a situation that would accelerate your 'ramp up' period? Thank you for being great sports and for bringing humor, teamwork, and excellence in spades to the team. We all feel so lucky to call you friends and colleagues!\n\n45#Extraordinary Times Call for Extraordinary People|When times get tough, Citi looks to Workhuman for leadership! Big congratulations to the partnership you've created at the Executive levels of Citi. Marty, from your first meeting with Premek, you gained credibility and insight, and created an opportunity to help build a new communications strategy for their 'new leadership'. Who knew that quite literally a few months later we'd have such an opportunity to really 'educate' their new leaders on how to promote a culture of appreciation! Lynette, as usual, your relationships and deep understanding of the customer, their brand and their culture, helped you to quickly stand up a full comms package in a matter of hours (!). This $2M+ boost is just the start of what could be our real 'work' with Citi. SO WELL DONE! Incredible leadership and collaboration! Thank you!\n\n46#CREATING A WAVE of GRATITUDE|Can you feel it? It's a soul lifting, soaking you to the bone, crashing wave of gratitude and joy that is emanating from this group of people. There are SO many ways this team of people is banding together, ideating, taking action, sharing, and LIFTING our customers (and each other) in this incredible hectic time! I just want to take a moment to say thank you for working through this time of uncertainty with your hearts on your sleeve. For reaching out to customers and giving them strength and light and the power to do good. If there was ever a team meant for the right now, it's this team. Thank you from leading from each of your seats and for creating incredible opportunities on a daily basis for our customers, for our brand, and for our business! You're ALL HEART and I'm loving it!!!\n\n47#This is us at UHG - Together, improving lives!!!!|Wait!! what?? Is this photo real? YES it is!! This is the newly energized, forward thinking, ready to tackle 2020 with vigor and determination UHG/WH team and what working together feels like today. We all heard it minutes in \"we're meeting with Patricia and Dave to fix how Bravo! is funded and ask for MORE FUNDING.\" That's huge!!! Marty, your coaching leadership style (internally and externally) has been stellar, strategizing on the right messages at the right time, cultivating innovation, pushing everyone forward, finding executive champions and positioning us for success, is clearly being seen and felt by all. Mark, you've become an instant trusted advisor, building strong relationships with Jacob and the extended UHG team, inspiring Jacob to bring the right people to the meeting who can say 'Yes', championing the cause and delivering at exceptional service levels is nothing short of amazing! Erica, you're new to the UHG/WH team and from moment one - your human portrait intro - you lit up the room. Your passion for data science and analytics shined through. One of the Bravo! program goals is to improve cross-enterprise collaboration, employee engagement, customer satisfaction and return on investment. You clearly illustrated the evidence-based recognition data shows exceeding, exceeding, exceeding! Erin, it's always delightful being in a meeting with you. Your enthusiasm for our product, why/what we do what we do, how our product continues to evolve to create exceptional employee moments that matter is clearly articulated throughout your talk track. And the way you show our support for customer goals, probing to learn more about the 'asks' and building excitement for what's possible is admirable. Your product section opened the door for dialogue around bringing other existing UHG programs onto the platform! Well done! UHG's tagline completely fits here ... Thank you all for improving the lives of others while doing your life's best work! You Rock!!\n\n48#Full Speed Ahead|#weworkhuman #shootthemoon #theinstitute  What a revitalizing day and a half! Thank you to this team of great big thinkers and risk takers for a deeply challenging few days of daring to reach for BIG ideas and creative paths to accomplish our mission. It was a great way to kick off our “project” for 2020. I believe this team, in this partnership, can achieve new heights. Thank you for giving yourself to this with your whole self! Cheers to the Dream State! Special shouts to Becky, Traci, and Jill for helping nail down our process and making sure we paused to drink and eat!!!\n\n49#Did we just become best friends?!|Team Gallows Dine Around 2020! What a lovely time we had at Ignite. From the cuisine (who doesn't adore poutine?!) to such wonderful conversation. 90's dance music, who would play our documentaries (nice icebreaker, Chris!), to finding hidden Bruins fans and exchanging hilarious movie quotes. What an awesome group. Thanks all so much for such a great night and being so awesome for my first dine around host experience.\n\n50#This is not a test---Citi|Marty! So many congrats on your work with Citi over the past several months. There is nothing like being literally thrown into the deep end. In typical Citi fashion, procurement was looking to make some unruly changes to our contract through the renewal process. With incredible confidence, you were able to leverage, INCREDIBLY, relationships that you've secured over the past *few* months, to talk the business leaders through 'their' commitment to us. While it can be very difficult to PUSH BACK hard in these big renewal situations, you made it look like any given Sunday. You flipped the script so hard, I had to re-read emails a few times. Master level work getting Citi secured and opening up an incredible opportunity to grow our business with them at the same time! Looking so forward to seeing what we can accomplish in 2020! Bravo!!\n\n51#Accelerating into 2020|What a year of surprises! Thanks to each of you for bringing your insights, ideas, and energy to bear on our top 5 accounts. We've been meeting quarterly to review from every angle how we can from every perspective, impact the business. So many great ideas were uncovered and put into action immediately from these conversations. And each of us, learned something big about how with some focus, we could more directly impact big opportunities as an organization. Thank you for early and late meetings, for staying focused, and for caring so much about excellence! This has been an incredible 'test' of the WH network! Bravo!\n\n52#Q4 QBRs Rocked!|Thanks to every person on this team for bringing your best selves to Cleveland in the middle of a flurry of major projects, meetings, deliverables, and personal commitments. Each of you came together to share some incredible best practices, strategies that have moved the needles with our biggest opportunities, and some big plans for 2020. There is no better group of people to spend 2.5 days with talking about work. You bring a passion to the business that is only matched by Traci's passion for Cleveland! Thank you for your commitment to excellence! You ROCK!\n\n53#Inspiring Team Bravo at UHG|What a way to make a 5 year fresh start! Incredible team meeting with our partners at UHG. They invited business hr leaders to our meeting!!!! It's a Bravo first! Amazing! Tee'ing up our 2.5 hrs together with INSPIRATION and INNOVATION was a heck of a start. I cannot remember all of the positive, momentum building moments/quotes, but I think the \"we've already started to bring our CEO on-board about setting this program up to be self funded so we can make some of the changes that we know will  improve our results...\"....\"I have SO many ideas about a communication strategy!\"....I'm sure you all have your favorites! A ginormous special shout out to our incredible partner, Traci P for staying up until all hours of the night to bring what was an incredibly constructed meeting to a next-level meeting flow! So much more energy than we've ever seen from this UHG team. Thank you for traveling to the tundra, for preparing so thoughtfully, and for bringing your incredible strengths to this great 'kickoff' to the next summit at UHG. I'm so excited for our opportunity and for what's to come for all involved! Bravo!!!\n\n54#Thank you to the NY Life team!|We had a fantastic onsite with NY Life this week and it was all possible because of each one of you. Thank you for all the hard work that went into preparing for this meeting. There was a lot of really valuable insight presented and the client feels our support! The NY Life team has a lot of great opportunities ahead of them and they feel more prepared knowing they have our partnership. Rick, special call out as I know there has been a lot of problem solving and creative solutioning dedicated to supporting NY Life’s requests and feedback.  Excited to see more to come!\n\n55#International Allegiance Effort|Hey Martin, thanks so much for your knowledge and input recently when it came to making connections with Workday in Europe.  It is still a work-in-progress, but you have helped us understand the terminology of roles in your former organisation and provided us with a better picture of who we should be attempting to liaise with.  Great meeting you at the boot camp and thanks for the follow-up with the early morning connection.\n\n56#And, they're off!|PaulMartin, what a joy it is to watch the two of you launch your careers at Workhuman! You've both been incredibly focused since day one, preparing to take on some of our largest, most strategic accounts, with a bang. Well, the race has begun (and I'm afraid, it's never going to end....there will be short breaks!!...but we're always moving forward!) Right out of the gate, you've been thrown right into some of the most complicated work we do and you're handling it all quite beautifully. So happy to have you on this amazing team! Let's do this!!\n\n57#Q3 Acceleration|Thanks to this team for another outstanding Acceleration Project quarterly mind meld. Every quarter we come together representing the expertise and perspective of many areas of the business. This quarter was special as we've 'accelerated' our thinking and really got the team thinking bigger and making connections and recommendations. This commitment and intense work for our top 5 customers is paying off as we have come away with a laundry list of opportunities and ideas to grow and protect the business. Thank you for your teamwork, intense listening skills, and outstanding impactful insights!!!\n\n58#The Percussion Section is on FIRE|Thanks to each of you for bringing your 'best beats' to Bootcamp! Every great band needs a percussion section that can offer confidence, a solid framework, and some sick solos. Each of you came to play in Newport! Thank you for sharing your success with our most significant customers, your confidence in our market leadership, and your learnings along the way. Not only did you share with the broader sales organization but also in our team meetings throughout the week.  It's always tough to get through our QBR session, even when we have twice the time, so this time was especially impactful as you shared your work and opportunities. Especially thankful for our teammates who are bringing the pain with some incredible marketing ideas and experience projects that should elevate our ability to play into our Mick Jagger years! Cheers!\n\n59#Judy Judy Judy|Thanks to this team of well prepared recognition mathletes for your partnership and expertise in our most recent encounter with our friends at UHG. Sometimes tough conversations are the road to enlightenment. And i truly believe we are paving that road. We’ve made a huge leap forward in mindset when the senior person in the room flatly states the need to double their budget and find a way to completely change the way that the organization funds recognition. Both of which will be incredible undertakings requiring his leadership. We could not have been more prepared to have this critical discussion thanks to all of the detailed work of this team and the all-in attitude it took to push the envelope real-time. The follow up work is underway and I’m certain that our relentlessness will lead to a greater employee experience for all UHG Bravo participants! Thank you!\n\n60#Aiming High With Lockheed Martin...|Team , excellent work yesterday as we walked the Lockheed Martin Team through their recognition journey.  Eileen, thank you for pushing the Team to showcase what great looks like and challenging us to ensure we have the right objectives for the meeting.  Patrick, through the various feedback from internal Team members and the Customer you choreographed the day perfectly.  The meeting would not have been as smooth and on point without your relentless attention to detail and preparation and coordination with all of the various Teams.  Shiamalee and Martin, thank you for getting us off to the right start by showcasing what a Workhuman Enterprise looks like.  Greg and Chris, assume job showcasing our WARI capabilities and highlighting the success and areas of opportunity based on Lockheed's own data.  I think this really opened their eyes to the partnership that they have with us.  And last but not least, thank you all for keeping them focused on good program design and the appropriate level of investment to ensure long term success in the future.  They have a ways to go; however I am confident that this Team will move the needle to ensure Lockheed Martin becomes a best in class Workhuman Enterprise.\n\n61#Teamwork!|Martin, I reached out earlier this week and asked for your help and you responded immediately.  I noticed you were connected to a sales executive on LinkedIn that I reached out to about Workhuman. You were so willing to help and reach out to him for me. I SO appreciate you putting yourself out there and assisting recruiting. Teamwork makes the dreamwork!  Thank you Martin!!  Casey Londregan\n\n62#Inspiring Greatness|Thank you to this incredible team of strategists for an impressive two (very) long days of concentrated best practice sharing, ideation, mind blowing progress on our dream state goals, and overall pure stamina. I was reminded again these last solid 48 hours exactly how much work you are doing and magic you are making at our most strategic customers. It is truly mind blowing what we can do as a team to impact the business. Thank you for your teamwork, your commitment to make the best of our time together, for helping to find the humor in some tough situations, and for being downright badass leaders. Each of you brought a perspective to our two day marathon that helped someone move an idea or a strategy forward. Each of you contributed your unique voice. Together, you make up the greatest team I’ve been privileged to work with. Onward to victory! Bravo!\n\n"
