"0#The Briefing Book Braintrust|Thank you all for the incredible teamwork that went into developing Eric, Tom, and KeyAnna’s briefing books for Paris. The level of precision, care, and expertise you each brought—from messaging and talking points to customer and prospect intel to logistics and scheduling—was next-level. I also really appreciated your support on the briefing calls, ensuring each leader was prepared and confident heading into a jam-packed week of engagements. The partnership, collaboration, and strategic thinking from this team made this new process both effective and efficient. Thank you!\n\n1#Q4 RFP Team Quarterly Meeting|Thank you Cam for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with the RFP team on our 2026 GTM business plan and how the team will contribute to its success. We had some great discussion in how AI will be inserted into the RFP process along with other priorities from your team contributing to our department mission of equipping teams with the insights and tools to perform at their best. 2025 isn't over yet and we still have a strong showing. 2026 is staged to be our best year ever!! Appreciate your continued support!! Michael & Team\n\n2#On Fire Fireside Chat|A big thank-you to you both for creating an engaging and inspirational Talking Points Fireside Chat. Your conversation beautifully reinforced the intention behind the messaging, while also providing relevant advice for how tot get that message across in a convincing way.   You brought the story to life by emphasizing the key points and sharing the context behind the “why,” helping the team connect more deeply with our differentiation and purpose. I truly appreciate the thought, time, and energy you put into making this session both impactful and motivating.\n\n3#Thank you for your partnership|Thank you for the time and care you’ve dedicated to supporting and advancing our skills-based job architecture through your participation in our workshops, thoughtful feedback and follow up work. Your insight, collaboration, and attention to detail are greatly appreciated. I look forward to our continued collaboration on this project\n\n4#2025 Strategy Execution and 2026 Planning Heroes|As we close out the 2026 planning cycle, I want to firstly thank you as leaders for your dedication to executing 2025 plan, intentionally building and shifting your practice maturities despite demanding business as usual delivery.    Secondly, thank you for your effort and thought over the last 2 weeks to reflect on this past year, prepare for 2026. Your commitment and partnership in this process have created momentum and change that can be seen in the business outcomes you deliver.\n\n5#Workhuman Business Model|Thank you so much for coming to Spark Leadership today to walk through Workhuman's business model! Your presentation was dynamic and engaging, and our leaders learned so much.\n\n6#Coaches of the Year|Big shoutouts to these individuals who all gave me super valuable coaching sessions for our new talk tracks. Each person was able to give me a different perspective and helpful tips to improve how I can tell the story of how Workhuman helps organizations better than our competitors. Sometimes sessions like these can be intimidating, but you can tell they truly cared and wanted me to get better. After each coaching session, I know that I improved overall from their feedback, which will help me during the sales process and turn these coaching sessions into sales.....LETS GO! Thanks again, squad!\n\n7#Share the Spark is Live!!!|Thank you all for your work on making this very early morning thought become a reality. It was a few weeks before Workhuman Live Denver that I had this thought about a customer referral program. Before I knew it, it was being announced at the customer party at Live. Here we are on Oct 1, 2025 and it's become a reality. Thank you all for your work, your attention to detail, your focus and your reality checks as we massaged this large idea into a manageable program. I have a feeling it's going to grow in time, but for now, lets sit back, and watch the referrals come in.\n\n8#From Good to Great|What a kickoff to Calibrate! After two weeks of leveling up from good to great, today was the payoff—and we couldn’t have done it without you. Your support helped the team truly master the message. Enablement sticks when you don’t just tell teams what to do—you show them how, and arm them with tools that make their work smoother. Thank you for your partnership and for helping us raise the bar on how we engage.\n\n9#HP RFP Submission|Thank you all for the quick turnaround on the AON/HP RFP response! Not only was this RFP unexpected, but we were given less than a 2-week turnaround to put together a response for HP's requirements, come up with new messaging, deep dive research into stats, etc. You all played a key roll in putting the final touches together. It does take a village and you all are the best villagers (sorry for bothering you on the weekend)! Michael\n\n10#Project Simplify Dream Team|I want to take a moment to thank you all for the work you’ve done to bring Project Simplify to life. It was no small undertaking, and the way you've approached it — with focus, creativity, and collaboration — has already set us up for meaningful impact. This project is a great example of what happens when smart people come together with a shared vision, and the power of collaboration across multiple functions. Thank you for the time, the intentionality, and the willingness to go \"in the weeds\" to bring this foundational body of work to life and activate on it in record time.\n\n11#GTM Summit|Cam, Tiffany and Maggie - Thank you for all the work that went into organizing the GTM Leadership Team Zoom onsite. It was incredibly well executed — thoughtful, organized, and productive.  Your efforts helped create the right environment for meaningful discussion and learning, and the session really sets the stage for how we continue to support our leaders and managers in developing and honing their coaching skills.  Appreciate all the time, energy, and coordination it took to pull it together, as well as the last minute pivot from an in-person session to fully remote.\n\n12#Minimum Commitment quality support|I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for your support with the Minimum Commitments. Your valuable feedback and insights have been instrumental in helping us keep track and manage customers effectively. I truly appreciate your collaboration and effort, and I look forward to continuing to work together.\n\n13#Workiva End User Engagement!|A huge thanks to all our business process control owners and preparers for your engagement with the internal control testing and assurance programme through Workiva! We have come a long way from go-live; from learning how to navigate the tool, providing useful feedback on improvements/dashboard, to now fully engaging in the tool and allowing us to systemise our end to end control management & assurance program. This wouldn't be possible without your continued engagement in responding to quarterly assessments, process doc updates, evidence requests and issue remediation tasks! Looking forward to building on this for H2! Thank you!\n\n14#You are a star|Thank you for your enthusiastic and engaged participation in the service model workshop. Your energy, insights, and willingness to engage made the session a great running start for our work together.  Your contributions—whether through thoughtful questions, creative ideas, or collaborative discussions—played a vital role in shaping the outcomes of the workshop.   Thank you for your time, effort, and commitment we know it takes a lot to spend this kind of time in workshops!\n\n15#Amazing Customer Focus for NPS workshops|I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank each and every one of you for your time, energy, and valuable input throughout the recent Net Promoter Score (NPS) workshops in Framingham. Whether you were able to attend one session, all six, or somewhere in between, your contribution made a real difference.  Across every workshop, what stood out was not just the quality of the ideas and actions, but the values and behaviours consistently demonstrated. There was a genuine, holistic care for the customer journey from beginning to end, exceptional cross-functional collaboration, and a clear passion for improving our customer experience. It was inspiring to see how willingly everyone shared knowledge, supported each other, and worked together with a common goal. Especially those who joined by zoom and also in late and early hours.   Your dedication, creativity, and commitment to follow through have set us on a strong path forward. Thank you again for making these sessions so impactful and for bringing such energy and care to this important work.    Looking forward to continuing this journey together\n\n16#Zurich Account Questions|Thank you Cam for tracking down the responses required for the Zurich NA submission. We needed some fine tuned responses and you came through with plenty of time to spare prior to the submission. Appreciate the support in getting things done!!  Michael\n\n17#Hospitality at its finest!|Last week, this team here demonstrated what it truly means to lead with hospitality, care, and professionalism — and it did not go unnoticed!  A key prospect of mine at Blue Origin reached out to express her heartfelt thanks for the extraordinary support, coordination, and human connections she and her team experienced during their time with us. From seamless logistics and thoughtful planning to deep technical engagement and powerful product demos, each interaction made them feel welcomed, heard, and confident in our partnership. The little things — from helping them find a hotel room to making sure they were introduced to the right people — made a big impact!  This kind of experience isn’t just good customer service — it’s strategic partnership-building. The trust, clarity, and enthusiasm we created together are helping to accelerate meaningful conversations and propel the deal forward in a big way.  To everyone involved: a sincere THANK YOU for showing up with heart, hospitality, and hustle. You're not just representing Workhuman — you're embodying it. 👏\n\n18#Heart & Hustle|To everyone who traveled to Denver and rolled up their sleeves to support our flagship event—thank you.  There are dozens of jobs, big and small, that need to come together to make an event like this work—and you did them all. From demo delivering to activation staffing, room management to speaker wrangling, customer hosting to Gratitude Bar support—every task you took on was vital to the experience we delivered.  Your energy, flexibility, and willingness to step in wherever needed didn’t go unnoticed. This event’s success was built on your hard work, and we are deeply grateful for everything you gave—your time, your effort, your talent, and your care.  Thank you for showing up, again and again. You made this event possible.\n\n19#Op Excellence, AI mustaches and twins for the win|Team! It was so great to spend some with all of you over the past week to start ironing out some parameters around what it means to be \"most excellent\" operationally across a handful of lanes. I thought our discussions were productive, action oriented, honest, and thought provoking. I enjoyed talking about short term, low cost options we could charge against, while balancing a longer term view of what excellent can look like, and what would need to happen to get there. It was also a treat to meet Mark's less Irish sounding twin... he seems cool, but I still think I like the real Mark better. Lastly, a special shout out for Hillary for raising her hand as captain and harnessing her ppt skills ;-)\n\n20#Pricing Guru!|Cam - As always, thank you for being an incredible asset to everyone in sales. On one day's notice, you graciously accepted our Corporate Team meeting to discuss pricing talk tracks and specific pricing scenarios. Your insights were incredibly helpful, and your expertise really makes a difference on how we continue to position our offerings. We are always appreciative and grateful for your support!\n\n21#Expert Interviews - Everest Group Research|Thank you so much to this group for your time, preparation, and insight offering during the SME interviews for our research partnership with Everest Group! The Everest Group analysts asked questions that interrogated why our approach to strategic recognition is the best: how we support customers in their success, how recognition is done right (and wrong), and how we teach the market to expect more from their recognition programs.  Your responses reflected the years of dedicated work you have all put into making work more human-- the contributions you made in these interviews will help the Everest Group create a research paper that details why recognition is a strategic imperative-- and specifically, why Workhuman's approach reflects recognition done right.  I'm so appreciative of your support for this Analyst Relations project! I'm looking forward to keeping this group updated on progress and sharing the final paper later this Spring. Thank you!\n\n22#\"Let me help you with that stick...\"|Cam, It was great seeing and meeting with you in person this week. You are always ready to jump in and support me. This quality you have is immensely appreciated. I know that I can darn near bring anything to you - in or out of your realm - and you will lend a hand. The advocacy you provide to CI is invaluable. Thank you. Sam\n\n23#Best of the Best!|On behalf of my fellow leaders and I, we just wanted to take a moment to say THANK YOU for spending yet another hour of your busy day with us (right after Level Up office hours, no less!). Your help in walking us through pricing and specific scenarios was incredibly valuable to us \"newbies.\" We truly appreciate the time, knowledge, and insight you both shared — especially considering how many directions you’re pulled in daily.  Having such knowledgeable and supportive team members like you makes all the difference, and we’re grateful to have you both as such incredible resources.\n\n24#CERTIFIED!|Cam - Thank you for volunteering to be the first to go through our certification process for SELT. It's never easy being first, but you eagerly stepped up to the challenge. You wanted to make sure you understood what it took to prep for and to pass this before we asked anyone else in the field to take on the same challenge. That's part of what makes you such a good leader. You were open to feedback that allowed us to tailor our approach and to make sure it's as clear as it can be. We appreciate you paving the way. - Brittany, Tiffany, Mary Jo & Maggie\n\n25#Activate - what an experience!!|Team - huge thank you and congratulations for the outstanding work planning and executing Activate. During the SELT meeting yesterday we took the opportunity to review the event in detail - the feedback was extremely positive!  The quality of the agenda, breakout sessions, presentations, panels, along with the perfect balance of down time for relationship building and collaboration was a hit!!  Planning these events takes significant time, effort, consideration, and requires \"buy-in\" from multiple stakeholders (who are sometimes tough cookies :-)).  None of it happens by accident and it is obvious you took into consideration every detail to create a flawless event.  I've heard multiple times that this was our \"best Activate yet\"!!  Thank you for everything you did to make it an awesome experience for all who participated!!\n\n26#\"Pricing\" Dynamic Duo|Chris and Cam! Thank you for creating and delivering not one, but two breakout sessions around pricing. There was a lot of very important information that we needed to present to the Sales and CE teams on a topic that can be tricky! You both do such an amazing job of taking this complicated topic and teaching in a very clear and engaging way. Thank you for all of your hard work on this breakout! The L&D Squad (\"Briffany\")\n\n27#CE Weekly|I wanted to take a moment to recognize the energy and effort each of you are putting into the CE Weekly deck and specifically call out how well the team is working together.  We are focused on setting ourselves up for a success and establishing new ways of working to ensure we are diligently managing the business in the spirit of delivering exceptional value for our clients and growth for the business. The efforts you are making to show key insights into billings, renewals, launch ramp statistics, and technical service SLAs not only help us identify priority areas for focus but also significantly enhance how we communicate our progress with other parts of the organization. Great work so far, and I’m excited for us to continue to iterate on this together!\n\n28#Peak Performance!|Team, congratulations on the incredible achievement of securing the Star Performer and highest-ranked position in the Everest R&R Matrix for 2025! This is a milestone we’ve never reached before, and it’s a testament to the dedication, hard work, commitment, and strategic focus each of you brought to this goal.  Your commitment to understanding our business, delivering the right information at the right time to the right people, and building strong relationships with the analysts at Everest was instrumental in this success - from 1:1 briefings across the world,, multi-page assessment completions, analyst summit engagements, email interactions, countless phone call and more... It’s no small feat, and the time, preparation, and attention to detail you all put in truly paid off.  Thank you for everything you’ve done to achieve this incredible result. Let’s take this momentum and aim to do it again this year—two years in a row would be an even greater testament to your exceptional efforts! ha.\n\n29#Thank you for your incredible partnerhship!|Cam - I can't thank you enough for your incredible partnership and the support you have provided me and the CE organization this year.  Your leadership and dedication to driving initiatives that transform how we operate has been remarkable.  You've been a critical sounding board for me and helped make a vision become a reality.  Whether it was operationalizing the new forecasting and performance to plan process or the new Client Health Dashboard, your thoughtful approach and willingness to tackle some hard challenges now provides us with multidimensional insights to identify risks and take proactive actions.  These contributions have given us greater visibility into the business and enable us to better service our clients, ensuring their success and ours.   Your ability to create clarity and structure in complex areas has been a driving force behind our progress, and I'm deeply appreciative of everything you have done.  Than you for your amazing partnership, hard work, and commitment to excellence.  I'm looking forward to continuing to collaborate and achieve even greater things together in 2025.\n\n30#Risk control on the up, thanks to you!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your exceptional efforts and dedication in managing our business internal controls throughout 2024. Your commitment to excellence and proactive approach have been instrumental in fostering and growing our internal control culture.  In particular, I would like to extend a special thank you to our Control Owners for taking ownership of their controls and providing invaluable input into improving our business internal controls. Your insights and contributions have significantly enhanced our processes and helped mitigate risks effectively.  We have come a long way, but there is still some work to be done. I am confident that with your continued dedication and support, we will get there together.  I also want to acknowledge the vital part our Control Preparers play in this process. Your diligence and hard work in ensuring the smooth implementation and ongoing success of our controls are truly appreciated.  Once again, thank you for going above and beyond in 2024. I look forward to continuing to work alongside you in 2025 and achieving even greater success together. Our risk control efforts are stronger than ever, thanks to you!\n\n31#Stretching with the Sales Consultants|The Sales Consultants traveled in from London, SoCal, Nevada and Florida this week for a two-day onsite at HQ and each one of you played a meaningful role in making our time together purposeful and informative. Thank you for carving out time from your individual schedules (and surges!!) to help stretch our thinking, feed our curiosity, and deepen relationships. Speaking for the team, we deeply appreciate the candor and partnership. It truly enriched our time and will help make us stronger and more effective going forward.\n\n32#Grateful for how you inspire...|Cam, on this auspicious day/week I wanted to take a minute to express my gratitude for the last 2 years.  I appreciate the curiousity with which you operate and how you consistently look for ways to apply new practices and thought leadership to our daily work.  You inspire our team to do things differently.  You are an igniter of ideas.  I appreciate that you take time out of your busy day to research, to learn and to commit yourself to thinking bigger, taking on new ideas, and then taking the time to discuss and shape the future of Workhuman.   There are so many areas of the business that have benefited from your involvement - CE Growth, TS operational efficiencies, operational reporting, customer profitability analysis, operationalizing the Deals Desk, and every other strategic initiative you have your fingers on.  Stay curious, Cam, and keep investing in your growth -  you are a multiplier and we are better because of you.\n\n33#Grateful for your partnership|Cam - what can I say other than I would be lost at WH without you. I can’t thank you enough for all you’ve done to help me onboard, make sense of how things work, tackle projects and always being an audience to bounce things off of. You are an invaluable partner, and I’m excited to continue to partner together!\n\n34#Deals Desk for Dropbox|Team - Chris W. and I wanted to thank you for your ongoing partnership, flexibility, and creativity when it comes to doing what is right by our customers. Most recently, this group proposed a solution to help Dropbox navigate missing their minimum commitment by seeing if we can amend their TFC. Dropbox's executive sponsor was impressed by the offer. While we don't have an answer yet, the proposal itself showed her Workhuman's willingness to partner with them and that we want to keep Dropbox as a long term customer. This customer is learning the ropes of so many things in the first year of their Spotlight program, and this is just another way we were able to show up collaboratively to support them. Thank you!\n\n35#What do you want this thing to do?|I'm so appreciative of the energy that everyone always pours into the creation of the event. I worry that you'll be come exhausted by us asking \"what do you want it to do?\" every year – but you always meet it with it's intended evolution. It IS a different question every year because we evolve as a business, the business world evolves on the daily, the industry and the people in it are different this year than they were last year. I love the saying \"you can never step in the same river twice\" because it's so true – and both the event and our company are a river! I'm grateful for the nuance and curiosity from those who have been to alllll the events and those who have only been part of the team for a short time. I'm super excited about where we're going to take it this year. I'm confident that this year's event innovations will be less about headshot activations and more about showing the world who we are. Thank you all for a great kickoff and in advance for what I'm sure is going to be quite the ride!\n\n36#Target Management|Tiffany, Cam and Kevin – I can’t thank you enough for the hours of work you’ve put into what has resulted in a successful rollout of multiple salesforce process changes and the new client management Target tracker. Thank you for working with me to make this come to life - from your input on the structure, the SFDC changes that needed to be made, operationalizing the trackers, the thoughtful approach to  the training plan, including dry runs and multiple training sessions tailored to different audiences, creating all the individual trackers, and joining 12 pipeline reviews, you’ve been an incredibly supportive team and I so enjoyed working with you all to get this kicked off. Excited for phase 2 :)\n\n37#Gratitude for Renewals Overview|Thank you Cam for providing a thorough and detailed overview of our renewals process. Your explanations were very helpful to my understanding. Keep up the fantastic work!\n\n38#Qualcomm - Welcome to the WH family!!|Huge congratulations to Sameer and the team who were actively involved in the successful sales process with Qualcomm.  After a 29-month cycle, I am extremely excited to share that they are the newest member of the WH customer family adding 50,000 more users to our platform!  It was a win that required significant effort and strategy led by Sameer with support from so many WH team members along the way to ensure we had a positive outcome.  During the course of the process we had more than 70 documented meetings and every engagement and deposit made was very intentional. This included having several key Qualcomm executives at WHLive, many “moments that mattered” (YOS videos, Birthday videos, delivering WH golf balls/shirts, even a video from Snapdragon stadium which is sponsored by Qualcomm), a strong ABM campaign (Custom demo, microsite, mood video), and lots of customer storytelling to create unparalleled levels of credibility.  This sales process was a rollercoaster ride with lots of twists and turns resulting in a head-to-head competition with Augeo who promised the world at highly aggressive prices. But at the end of the day Qualcomm realized that our level of experience, product capabilities, and strategic value we provide are hands down the best in the industry and we became the obvious choice.  This would not have happened without the tireless work of all involved including Hari Date, Nuvs, Erin Avery, Cam Torre, Martina Campbell, Jason Gori, Meisha-Ann Martin, Larry Dennison, Alessandra Fagone, Brian Moore, Brian Kennedy, Owen Cooney, Christopher Claude, Julia Towle, Emily Smith, Hillary Mahoney, Chuck Labovitz, Rich Sorrentino, Rahul Srinivasan, Nick Eng, Ekaterina Kim, and Nina Reichert.  Thank you for going above and beyond to support this important sale!\n\n39#Customers being acquired project team|Team, well done! Together, we officially launched a critical new process driving awareness, action and accountability with respect to existing clients being acquired by new business opportunities. Born out of a forecast call, and each of you raising your hand, we spun up this collective cross-functional effort with our first meeting mid-July, and now early Sept, we've trialed two scenarios and built a repeatable process. Sales, CE, Legal & Finance came together to build strategies & process in an effort to protect our base while optimizing new business, exploring ways to leverage clients to open new doors, gain insight, and hopefully land and expand. At one point, we identified 8 clients with ~$20M billings and approx $72M in new biz to mine through. While the true hard work has only just begun, it HAS begun, and we have a process in place that can now repeat. Thank you for your imagination & determination to drive this innovation!\n\n40#Amazing colleagues|Jose, Daniele, Dave, and Cam, I want to acknowledge the tremendous effort you've put into supporting our customers. I'm truly blown away  The hours you’ve dedicated are incredible, and it’s a pleasure working with you. The recent workshop we had speaks volumes about your commitment to enhancing our support. I’m excited to continue working with you and joining calls with customers. The sense of camaraderie you’ve built with our customers is impressive, and the relationships you've fostered are remarkable. I can clearly see the amazing work you've done and the relentless hours you’ve invested. Your dedication to our customers is truly phenomenal—just wow!\n\n41#Community Milestone: Gainsight Selection/Contract|Celebrating a big milestone—our Gainsight Contract for Community and  LMS is officially signed and delivered! 🎉 A huge THANK YOU to everyone for your valuable contributions and expertise during the community/LMS vendor selection and contracting process. Your diligence, thoughtfulness, and dedication helped us get this across the finish line. I appreciate the open dialogue, time, urgency and collaboration from each of you. Looking forward to kicking off the next phase with many of you!\n\n42#Partnership Goals|Cam! This feels overdue but sending a \"thank you\" for being such a great partner to me as I've started to get closer to the Client side of the house. You are always willing to field a slack, \"quick\" call, etc. from me and take the time to hear my POV, and offer your own. It's clear to me that you are a champion for the Redemption Experience (E-comm) here, which brings so much value not just to me, but the entire E-comm team. On top of the work stuff, I've enjoyed getting to know you better as well (sometimes I say \"wait, are we the same person?\"), and have a few laughs along the way. I'm looking forward to our cross-functional partnership continuing to thrive, and what we can accomplish in the future! Thanks, Cam!\n\n43#NPS input and actions workshop -  Phase 1|I have huge respect for this amazing team of customer centric humans who joined a 3 hour workshop in order to look at our nps results and give greater context and insight into the customers behind the comments and everything else that is happening in their space.   This is only the first of 3 different sessions in order to ensure that we are focusing on the correct 3 to 5 informed actions in H2 that will continue to show our intense focus on customer experience with our program management audience.   Thank you for so generously giving your time to this important meeting and I look forward to our next session.\n\n44#Spark Leadership Guest Speaker of the Year!!!|When I polled folks across the business to find out \"who is incredibly charismatic and informative when explaining our business model?\" Cam's name came up so many times. Cam, you took a seed of an idea and turned it into an incredible 1 hour presentation for our 31 Spark Leadership participants. Thank you so much for building the materials, taking feedback before the presentation, leading a Q&A, and giving one of the best ever guest speaker sessions. Don't take my word for it - one of our participants said: \"Cam was a fantastic addition to the session. So interesting to understand our pricing model and how we make money. Learned a lot!\" Best of all, we will be able to repurpose some of the recording for future training as well! THANK YOU CAM!\n\n45#Designing Service & Support Future|Thank you for your outstanding dedication and engagement over the last 2 days. Each of you brought unique perspective, experience and insight into the workshop. Thanks to you, we have a strong foundation for building the maturity of our service and support capability over 2025.\n\n46#Work in progress and progress achieved!|Team,  I wanted to pause a moment and express gratitude for the support you have given as we try and put some rigour and process around our Insights to Action reporting and oversight.  All of you have been working diligently on executing different projects in order to help drive improvements in our program involved customers sentiment (we often refer to as \"buyer\" )   The recent nps results have been a reflection of the work all of the Workhuman teams have been doing,  but it is important that we get information to the relevant groups in order to help them decide which of the customer requests should be prioritised.  This is an ongoing piece of work and we have plenty of road ahead,  but this is a great point to recognise that we are making progress!  thank you and looking forward to refining this further\n\n47#Shining Team for GDS|Your efforts to ensure a quality meeting with the broader team at EY GDS are much appreciated. Taking the time to prep, dry run, and discuss the areas that need to be discussed is much appreciated.  From teams integration, to reporting, security and data feed and spend management this team was able to answer all questions posed by the HRIS & Operations team from GDS.  Well done all and we look forward to working together on next steps to provide GDS with the best possible Workhuman solution.\n\n48#Showing up - great coaching|Cam, thank you for showing up for me to help talk out key points, validating my understanding, and shoring up my approach in advance of a prospect call close to the finish line today. I was feeling the pressure to close it, and your coaching in the moment was what I needed to solidify my path forward. As I said in the video, “one thing has nothing to do with the other” made the light bulb go off 💡💡💡. Thank you. Thank you for showing up for me, showing up for our clients consistently, with high engagement for our success. I’m grateful to be in this together, bouncing off ideas, talking through challenges, grinding it out every day.\n\n49#IDC RFI|A quick thank you for providing the necessary details for the IDC RFI. It's important we place well in this upcoming Marketscape on the recognition market, and your insights and focus on data quality is just one piece of the puzzle we need to be successful.\n\n50#Helping shape leaders|Cam, thank you so much for your leadership recommendation reads. \"Reality-Based Leadership\" by CY Wakeman and \"Dare to Lead\" by Brene Brown have really opened my eyes both in how to be a better leader and a better human. They've helped me identify the fact that story building is something I naturally do, and that I should take a step back, ask clarifying questions and build my courage. They've also helped me identify the benefit of helping team members build their own courage by not being dependent on their leaders. I'm looking forward to practicing what I've learned from both to these great reads in order to build those leadership muscles. side-note, you're also a prime leader role model, thank you for all your help!\n\n51#Business Acumen for People Leaders|A huge shout out to Cam for building an amazing session on Business Acumen for People Leaders, which will debut in Spark Leadership later this year. This session breaks down how Workhuman makes money in a way that is understandable and informative. The content explains our company value prop in a way that's conversational. Thank you so much Cam for building and presenting this session to our People Leaders!\n\n52#Interview Dream Team|I'm not certain I've personally gotten to each of you, but today Peibei accepted our offer to become our first Senior Pricing & Profitability Manager.  This would not have been possible without each of you giving of yourself to interview the candidates and sharing your insightful feedback.  I don't take lightly the \"ask\" made of you to invest your time to ensure we add another quality \"human\" to our ranks, and I know the right hiring decision was made because of each of you.  I am grateful for colleagues like yourselves and I am always impressed and better able to have success in my role (including that of hiring manager) when I have the opportunities to listen to each of you share your knowledge, opinions and experiences.  Thank you for all you do to make our company the success it is...\n\n53#“Great Scott!”|Feb 7, 2022 - My 50th day in role, and likely the 10th time I asked how WH managed subscription overages. Cam & Kev, as you may recall, we held a call on that fateful to discuss. We knew our agreements allowed us to charge clients \"for additional Users above the designated Quantity\", but we also knew that due to a lack of process & data transparency, our Humans could not ably act on this claim, leaving meaningful unbilled dollars on the table each year. By the meeting’s end, we crafted a vision, including mining data with Product to display via QuickSight, developing user reporting for our teams & our customers, defining what “valid” users are, and establishing overage thresholds. We did not lack inspiration, but lamented we were not organizationally ready for the discipline & insights needed to execute.  Apr 2024 - My sincerest thanks and congratulations to ALL of you business stewards, for assembling your talents to redefine the term “shared success partner”! After a 2+ year business transformation journey, you have successfully launched a thoughtful, 1st generation invoicing solution grounded in that Feb ‘22 vision. This month 55 clients were intentionally billed for their Q1 user overages, resulting in tens of thousands of revenues being realized for valued products & services – and this is the first of many quarters where this will routinely occur.  I laud your varied contributions that now benefit our company. You have designed, piloted, and launched new protocols, tools, reporting and communication cadences, and have ensured WH and our customers are both aware of who is benefiting from our products, and you are enabling us to take “credit” for this goodness whenever we determine we should. Please know your combined efforts have set an impressive new standard for future successes should we once again choose to elevate our already solid business expertise to greater heights.\n\n54#Nailed It - Texas Style|With a final RFP presentation at Baylor Scott and White, the Monday after Workhuman Live, it meant putting your game faces on (not to mention flying BACK to Texas) and you all delivered.  Erin and Cam, it was so great to see you in action in person. This meant that there were serious time challenges, third party questioners and a large group to present to.  You both NAILED IT with a compelling conversation about our philosophy, platform features and capabilities and discussion of our partnership, not to mention discussing the art of the possible with Wellness Programs.  The people in the room were very engaged and appreciative of the discussion.  Even with the time constraints, you hit all the points, played off each other well and made a real conversation.  Katrine and Allie, your participation on the zoom call confirmed that we have and will provide excellent support for them, and your knowledge of the context helped us prepare thoroughly.  You all put our best foot forward and the 3rd party evaluator put it best when we saw her later “You did a great job”.  Thank you!\n\n55#One for the Books!|Here's to the incredible team of humans who supported our WHL breakout session scanning & line management this year in Austin!  You all stepped in and stepped up, and I cannot thank you enough for your patience, smiles, generosity and frankly keeping your calm, even when at a few sessions, it felt like people were ready to storm the room! You were all pros, from start to finish - and wow did we finish on Thursday with a bang at Cy's session. It truly looked and felt like this image above. Thank you for being kind even to those folks who we all knew were \"pulling one over on us\" (let us never give out book signing tickets again!) and for being so wonderful to me, running around with my hair on fire. And most importantly, for filling in for each other when other priorities arose - delivering a truly amazing experience for every one of our attendees, and for all your teammates. You are appreciated more than you know.\n\n56#Teamwork makes the dream work!|Thank you for taking time out of your day to meet with me. I appreciate the knowledge and history sharing, it helps me since I am still fairly new to WH. You did a great job breaking down the different sections of a contract just so I can visually understand how most are done. Thank you!\n\n57#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders.

I must also acknowledge our Workhuman back-office teams - your support over the last 18 months has been the backbone of our success from procurement and legal contracts to finance and administrative champions, your relentless support ensured that every piece fell perfectly into place.  Your collective attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and commitment to inclusivity have not only enhanced our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community but also enriched the experience for every attendee.

Cheers to the entire team behind WorkhumanLive Austin!\n\n58#RFP Superstars!|Thank you all so so much for going onsite to BSW and giving the most incredible presentation - it was so apparent how much time, effort and preparation went into today. The customers were so engaged, asking questions, laughing at stories and really taking in everything that you were showing to them. I know everyone just got home from WHL and to then hop on a flight for a one hour onsite was probably the last thing anyone wanted to do so THANK YOU! And not just for today, but for all of the ongoing strategy and presentations while I was gone too. You all absolutely killed it :)\n\n59#Quick to be Strategists for Lunch!|Brenda and Cam, Thank you so much for joining Brandon and I for lunch with Lisa for MillerKnoll.  The complexity of what they have been going through as an organization from the CEO PR Debacle to the two most senior level HR leaders leaving and being replaced along with their efforts to harmonize 16 brands amidst it all has been interesting to navigate during a deal cycle.  The two of you were more than happy to spend time with Lisa at Workhuman Live, engage in robust conversation and really listen to all the challenges she has faced in her 8 month tenure with the organization.  Cam the second you heard they were in your home state you willingly offered to be on site and be part of the conversation.  Brenda the time you put in providing your additional thoughts after the lunch conversation and ability to see the many impacts of their strategy is so valuable.   Appreciate you stepping in and value the partnership with you both!\n\n60#Urgent Customer Questions from Qualcomm|Since nobody was busy this past week, getting to this urgent request from Qualcomm should be easy.  Oh wait, we had Workhuman Live ALL week long which required significant FOCUS (see what I did there) and attention to making sure all the attendees were having the best experience possible, learning, networking, and being inspired.  After our big finalist presentation last week, there was a glimmer of hope that we'd have a chance to breathe as we entered the week of WHL24.  However, we received a flurry of questions that came from Qualcomm that needed to be answered with accuracy, care, and sensitivity due to the nature of where we are in the sales cycle.  You all were kind enough to break away for a bit to help me think through and craft the proper responses, which included another clarifying question even after we sent over the initial responses.  I simply wanted you to know how unbelievably grateful I am to this group for your support 💯\n\n61#Help with Babson students|Thank you for your help walking the Babson students through your organization and how we use data to drive decisions.\n\n62#Ever Evolving Team|Thank you all for your continued support in nurturing the non-org,  Salesforce Team! The collaboration and constructive discussions had around structuring the team and each of our responsibilities (yay RACI discussions at 8AM/EST) helps in both our personal career development AND our teams efficient, quality, deliverables to the business.\n\n63#End User NPS vs Program Design...Signals Found!!|Wanted to take a quick moment to celebrate this brilliant team for your continued focus and teamwork. For many weeks, you've carved out time to crunch the numbers (Barbara & Radoslaw), make sense of the patterns (Cam, Lynette & Naomi), and helped us take our findings forward to new stakeholders. Congrats on the great progress we've made and always looking forward to our next!!\n\n64#Bringing Vague Ideas to Life!|Chuck, Cam - I cannot thank you enough for your inspiration, innovation, drive and commitment to bringing the concept we talked about back in November to life in our 2024 CE compensation plans.  Each of you working diligently to bring clarity & definition, thinking through the possibilities and delivering a solid approach to replacing our MBO components in our plans with something that is quantifiable and unquestioningly aligned to our objectives as an organization and as a company.  I am so indebted to both of you for your tireless approach to getting it done right and done well.  Thank you for taking the time to consider a lot of different options, work with people across the organization like Meghan to understand how NPS works, and ensure that we could inject this new way of compensating our teams in time to lock in for 2024.  Your attention to detail, careful consideration to what works, and desire to build an approach that would actually enable upside for our people is so appreciated.  Undoubtedly this took many cycles of discussion, contemplation, reworking and more research.  And then, Chuck to have taken the extra step to put the powerpoint slides together that told the whole story for our team call today was an added bonus.  THANK YOU!\n\n65#Data Delight!|Team, thank you all for the recent work on various report generation and data reviews.  So much of the work we do is dependent upon data to make informed decision and predict future outcomes.  All of you have helped in generating new reports supporting both Workhuman Live and Spotlight on audience data & segmentation trends, revenue trends, historical performance, trend comparisons and normalization, and more.  It’s a daily need, that continues to push us in the right directions and supports the strong event performance we are seeing.  Thank you all for your partnership, collaboration, and patience.  Now just wait for the post event asks 😉\n\n66#Many Hands Make Light Work|Throughout the week we met with this group of individuals to help us get ready for a very important upcoming meeting with Applied Materials.  During our time with them in the sales process, design, implementation and launch this January...their team has always had an interest in what their near peers are doing in this space.  As we prepare for our meeting next week with the Head of Compensation, Head of Benefits, and Shared Services Leadership - all of you played a role in helping us understand how LAM and KLA have been successful in partnering with Workhuman.  In addition, we learned more about how Gilead decided to finally make the move from YOS only to adding R&R to the equation as they look to take their program to new heights.  I feel like we'll be able to confidently lead the Applied team to understanding the value of our partnership, and how we can ensure they are wildly successful as they grow their program and partnership with us.  Thank you all again for your support, it is so very appreciated 💯\n\n67#Ai Assistant Ideation Session|Thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules to come together, collaborate and help generate ideas for our new Ai Assistant. The next challenge for the POC team is to add Workhuman data into our Ai Assistant. Thanks to your participation we now have 100s of ideas that can be prioritized and potentially used in some shape or form for the next version of the POC. Although we ran out of time I hope you all enjoyed the discussion and being part of the contribution process for this project. Looking forward to collaborating with you again in the future.Thanks.\n\n68#Season of Giving Shout Out!|Shout out to the Season of Giving taskforce for yet another successful customer marketing holiday campaign (and debrief session)! Thank you to all who collaborated well in advance of the campaign kickoff and throughout the season to plan and monitor this campaign. With this cross-functional partnership these campaigns continue to improve as we drive more engagement with our customers & unlock new opportunities to encourage recognition during these important national & global holidays. Thank YOU!\n\n69#Making great progress|Barbara, Lynette & Cam...thank you so much for your continued focus on our Recognition Maturity Model passion project. Barbara, you've taken our idea and run with it in such an amazing way and based on our latest meeting, it's easy to see how incredibly close we are to being able to pull out some very useful Program Design insights from our Qualtrics eNPS data. Cam and Lynette, a huge THANKS for continuing to share your invaluable perspectives on what questions to ask based on your extensive experience with our customers over many years. We've now had around a half dozen meetings over these past 4 months and we're making steady progress! Know we have more work to do but I can't help but celebrate each of you as we continue to move forward. Very soon we'll able to share with our future customers (and any current customers looking to freshen things up) all of our data driven best practice program design recommendations thanks to this project:) Cheers to this brilliant team for all the work thus far!!\n\n70#Unlocking key customer data|Thanks Cam for joining my All Hands to continue to educate and unlock where and how my team can see where to find key customer insights. Today was an important call to continue to connect the dots between the work they do to our initiatives to Zoe’s breakout to the WH Strategy Board. Having it all tie together matters, and being able to learn how they can measure impact of various strategies plus see commitments in forecasts…it all hangs together. I’m impressed with how quickly dashboards and capabilities to measure what we need has come together, and it’s why you hit the stage last week. You continue to deliver day in and day out in pursuit of teamwork and collaboration to make us stronger and Win. And yes, I’m going to keep using that pic time and time again!\n\n71#Coming Together for BSW|I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for coming together quickly to help with our upcoming capabilities meeting for Baylor Scott and White. After receiving the email from WTW letting us know we were being requested to join a meeting to help BSW during their review of different recognition programs this team quickly came together to develop a well thought out presentation with just over a weeks notice. I know many of you rearranged calendars to ensure you could make both the planning and final meetings and due to this I feel confident that we are well prepared for this meeting and will be very successful.\n\n72#Prize is Right!|Thank you all for your participation in playing Prize is Right at Activate! While not everyone could win the grand prize, we appreciated everyone being willing to go up on stage and have some fun!\n\n73#The best \"TEACH\" ers!!|I wanted to take a moment before the craziness of Activate begins to say a huge that you to this group. All of you not only said yes, when asked to be a facilitator for the \"Teach\" breakout session, but you have all gone above and beyond to make this session great! You brought your expertise, ideas, and creativity. I so appreciate the time you have put into creating this session the past couple months since I know how busy your schedules are. I am so exited to bring all this greatness to the CE and Sales teams this week. THANK YOU!!!\n\n74#Putting Pendo to the Test|Team, thank you all for the partnership and support in leveraging Pendo to extend reach and awareness of Workhuman Live to our customers.  This was a true integrated team effort to align across marketing, customer experience, technology, product & analytics, legal, ops, and more!  Innovating and trying new things is such an important aspect of how we will grow, achieve results, and ideally reduce overall effort needed across the team to do more at every step. I appreciate everyone being open and enthusiastic to the idea, working together to help bring it to life. Now we watch to see what we learn from it!\n\n75#Creating Caring Moments for Kaiser|While this took a little longer to share, it was really important to me to share my appreciation with this incredible team that helped put us in position to both get selected as a finalist and deliver a winning presentation.  It all starts with the great relationship that you have been building Chris that put us in a good position to kick things off.  James and Michael helped paint the picture by leading the RFP part of the process which was incredibly detailed, and as per usual, you crushed it.  Making sure we showed up and ready to dazzle - Larry, Brian, Kevin, Owen, and Chris...can't thank you enough for your excellence in building a fantastic custom demo and mood video for the delivery team, it really was moving for them.  Lastly, to Nuvs, Cam Jason, and Lisa, thank you for helping craft and deliver an incredible presentation to the 15+ attendees from the Kaiser team.  We've left a lasting impression on their team and have given ourselves the best chance to bring on the entire enterprise of 200K employees.  I appreciate all that you do to help set us up for success, and hopefully all this teams efforts will result in another happy Workhuman customer!!!\n\n76#The answer is yes!|I couldn’t be more grateful for your recent support in helping to get our first-ever live workshop for the Sustain/Evolve segment off the ground. Whether the ask was to cofacilitate and help shape the agenda (Patrick), figure out how to host the live workshop and register customers (Luke), or set up and send registration emails from Salesforce (Cam, Miguel, and Chrissy), the answer was always a resounding YES! I know 2024 has started with a bang, so I appreciate how you all stepped up with already full plates to help us kick off a new initiative to better support our customers and their long-term success. While we’re a few weeks out from the inaugural event, the first email we sent was a success and registrations are already coming in. I thank each of you for your respect for teamwork, your respect for customers, but most of all, your respect for urgency!\n\n77#People Leader of the Year!|Cam, I seriously couldn't have dreamt up a better People Leader! There have been many ups and downs throughout 2023 and you were there with a cool head throughout it all. You recognize the importance Salesforce plays for the company as a whole and are open to re-prioritize at a drop of a dime to ensure the mission critical/most value added projects are top of list, even if that means a project outside of your department! You give us the space needed to complete projects and always offer a helping hand when barriers popup. I hope I can be even half the People Leader you are some day! Thank you for being you!!\n\n78#Fantastic Partner|What is the definition of partnership?   \"A partnership is an arrangement between two or more people to oversee business operations and share its profits and liabilities.\"   Cam, Thank You. Thank you for the hours of time you have given me throughout 2023 in service to helping me better understand client operations, billings growth and the state of the customer business. You have helped me learn to fish, enabling me with tools and insights involving me in a way that I now have such a deeper level of understanding and appreciation for the client side of our business. Along the way we have had some incredible conversations too flushing out opportunities, ideas, whales, and the number of books you have shared in your excitement of new ideas is inspiring.  Thank you for being a partner, sharing with me our profits and liabilities. I appreciate you are a straight shooter, open-minded, highly motivated, thoughtful and passionate about our direction. It has been absolutely wonderful to partner with you this past year, and I'm looking forward to what we'll accomplish in 2024! 🍻\n\n79#Minimum Commitment Support|Lads a massive thank you to both of you for all of your help with minimum commitment this year and especially the last few months. You have both really helped our team push the process of sending invoices once a client misses their commitment target which has resulted in no delay in sending invoices. The last few months you have also taken ownership of the At Risk Clients list and taken the group through that on our monthly call, asked the CSM for updates along the way and pretty much said \"Send\" to every potential penalty ahead of time. This has been a huge help to the billing team. Thank you both and enjoy!\n\n80#Moderna 3-Year Closed/Won!|Team, we can officially say that the Moderna 3-year renewal is officially closed!  Cam and Jamie, your efforts were instrumental in making this a reality.  Throughout numerous discussions with the Moderna team, you helped us clearly demonstrate the unique value we offer and why we are priced the way we are.  Moreover, I truly appreciate your partnership with the CSM team.  Your willingness to share knowledge, help facilitate crucial conversations, and highlight the importance of why we choose to monetize our system in 2 key areas, underscores your dedication to delivering maximum value to our clients.  Chris and Chuck, a heartfelt thank you for your crucial roles behind the scenes and your willingness to talk through the final details.  Your support is always appreciated!  Alex, you have maintained a strong relationship with this group for the last couple of years, which led us to this point.  We had a nice onsite with them earlier this year, and they had no doubts that Workhuman was the right partner for them to help energize and get the most out of their employees.  Thank you again to this entire team for delivering a key win to close out 2023 strong.  Cheers to 2024!\n\n81#World Gratitude Day Customer Task Force|Following our WGD reporting debrief, I wanted to take moment to recognize this amazing team of cross-functional superstars who planned, collaborated, and ideated week after week in the months leading up to WGD. Cheers to executing our most successful campaign yet: double and triple digit YOY % increases, 1M awards sent, 1M+ end users reached….and the list goes on! This was an incredible team effort from day one and the results are a testament to the dedication put forth by this team to continually enhance and support these campaigns on behalf of our customers. Well done!\n\n82#Bay Area, Birria and the Balm of Gilead|Team Gilead, as I reflect on our whirlwind travels in the blue-sky Bay Area, I am thankful for everyone's commitment to making this Design Lab meeting a success for our Gilead partners. With some big team changes (PM out on maternity, one of the program sponsors unexpectedly out on long-term leave, executive sponsor getting more involved), it was critical to get face-to-face time to instill confidence in Gilead for their program launch and timeline. The fact that Camille gave us four hours of her time speaks volumes, and we got important insight into leadership and cultural initiatives underway at Gilead, as well as how to position the program for success to support a culture of gratitude (\"G\" is for Gilead and Gratitude!) Thanks to our amazing sponsor Lianne, we learned about the Balm of Gilead (a biblical perfume with healing properties), how delicious Birria nachos are on Food Truck Thursday, as well as a rapport-building dinner in Burlingame. Cam, the strength of the relationship and Gildead's careful consideration of their program design with the massive change elements is a credit to your pre-work and handholding with the team to contract. Matt, my partner in crime (8 launches and counting?!) - thank you for co-piloting our Design Lab approach to ensure we provided Lianne with the best experience, and the confidence that we used the time with their stakeholders in the best possible way. Dinorah - thank you for traveling cross-country for this learning experience, enhancing our client experience and supporting me onsite at the DL. There's no one else I'd rather embark on a Lyft minivan tour of the Bay area with than the three of you!\n\n83#Thank you!!|Hari and Cam, Thank you so much for leading the conversations in the CE Challenger- Budget Conversations Workshops this week. Cam, you identified an opportunity to provide learnings and insights to the CE team that align with the skills we are learning in Challenger and helped build a workshop that will help the team in those all important growth conversations! Hari, when I tapped on you to share your knowledge and skills you did not hesitate to not only lead the training, but also come in person so that we can start to bring back the valuable connections that can only happen when we are together. Thank you both so much!\n\n84#RFI Rockstars!|Last Friday, Kaiser Permanente Enterprise (the parent company of KP Washington, KP Foundation, and Washington Permanente Medical Group with a combined opportunity of over 250,000 potential EE's) sprung on us an RFI as the larger enterprise is looking to potentially expand their R&R program to the entire population which is a HUGE opportunity. Not only did they spring the RFI on us on Friday, but the responses were due less than 7 days later and thanks to you all, WE MADE IT!  Christa, Robyn, and Cam - thank you for being flexible enough to literally jump on a call less than 2 minutes after the Risk Call to discuss the proper best next steps and helping me get this over the finish line. James, I can't really put it any other way than YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Even with another finalist meeting and multiple other RFS/RFI's, you managed to pull the entire RFI together in a ridiculously quick manner. I can not express how much we appreciate your support here. Here's to winning Kaiser Permanente Enterprise's business in 2024!! :)\n\n85#Thank you|Hello all,  Thank you so much for all the collaboration, craic and kindness during my time in WH. You have been an absolute pleasure to work with across marketing, sales and cx where everyone works so hard to do whats right to continue to drive WH to success. Thank you for the strong support of enterprise architecture and at a personal level your tremendous support to me. I would also like to thank Amie Preston who isn't on the system.  Its been an absolute pleasure and I know I will see some of you again :)!!!  Gill\n\n86#Landing the $12M Whale - Gilead!|What a milestone - it was months in the making, but you never took your collective focus off the Gilead bouncing ball!  Cam - you spotted the opportunity - you created the spark and brought the players together to grow the opportunity to the whopping $12.1M annual possibility.  You drove the relationship, you earned a seat at the table, and continually reinforced Workhuman's value.  Erin, you jumped in as the consultant to get those sparks to fly with the customer by bringing the solution & insights to life.  Julia, Chuck, Chris - you needled, you negotiated, you helped us get to the structure that ultimately sealed the deal.  Timing is everything in this business and you all were on point.  This is an historic opportunity that will set the bar high for what is possible when we operate with a growth mindset!  Congratulations! Can't wait to see the sequel(s)!\n\n87#1H Ring the Gong|Thank you so much for this group for helping us to recognize our wins and milestones for the first half of 2023! I appreciate you taking the time to pull together sales wins, customer launches, renewals, and product innovations, along with the teams and individuals involved so we could celebrate and share with all across the company. Cheers!\n\n88#Providing Honest Feedback|Thanks for connecting with me on the Conversations pricing analysis sheet. You understood the project's importance and the need for data accuracy. I appreciate your review, honest feedback, and for calling out the missing considerations. Glad I can team up with you. Thanks for being a great colleague!\n\n89#We appreciate you!|Cam and Jamie -  I have to give you both a huge THANK YOU for always being great partners to the CSM team.  Your constant support is such a great reassurance when we are dealing with a client inquiry or heavy discussion.  Knowing that you both are willing and able to support our clients is the best feeling.... and then seeing you work your magic is the cherry on top.  I know I have reached out a few times in recent weeks and never once felt like I was bothering you or asking for something that would burden you.  Please know your day in/day out support is paramount to our collective success.\n\n90#You all are my sunrise!|I'm 1000% stealing Cam's summary of the WHCP team and turning it around to thank each of you: You each were the food, sun and water to helping make for a terrific all hands today.  Luke, you pulled together interesting and compelling stats to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of Customer Central, and iterated an idea into a very fun game that spurred interest and interaction across the team. Thank you for being receptive to my suggestions; you were lightening quick and the reveal elements you designed were so fun! Melissa, you took my choppy slides and thoughts with notes and turned it into an immersive and interesting deck, also remaining flexible to all the \"one more edits\" and \"can you add\"s that occur all the way to the night before. I am so impressed with your talent. William, thank you for sharing and showcasing Invitation Homes as a successful offline story. As you heard from the team, they are interested in sharing that story forward, using client images if they agree -- that's success! Thanks for paying it forward. Cam...my star of the show...thank you for joining to demonstrate how they can measure the impact of the team's engagements by viewing billings, IPE growth and more. You left them wanting more, and I'm excited that we are bringing this level of business insight and interest. I love that you plugged right into my spring/summer analogy, and was super touched to hear you compliment the team as the \"Food, Sun and Water\" for our clients.  Thank you Everyone for making the meeting shine, and bringing me such warmth today.\n\n91#Salesforce Superheroes!|Overdue (but MIGHTY!) gratitude and congratulations to you Superheroes for the launch of Consulting Engagements in Salesforce! You lent your individual superpowers and collaborated on a difficult task to accomplish an important goal. An example of I=I+D at its best!  Jen, your vision was the start and your prioritization was the successful finish! Thank you for sharing prior learnings and re-centering us when we got mired in making it just right. Your push to \"go\" was the pivot point that got us live.   Cam, as translator and negotiator, your knowledge of both our team and SF helped us interpret each other’s language and offered give-and-get perspective. And your \"let's just try it\" guidance pushed us forward.   Chrissy, our lynchpin. You tweaked an existing approach, scrapped it, tried others, and ended up where we started. Accurate? Haha! I loved the moments when we’d be stuck and you’d suddenly push back from the desk with an idea. You could practically see the lightbulb go on! Meanwhile, you dug into a part of the business you hadn’t really worked with before. Your sheer expertise and being the SF key-holder made you invaluable. But the WAY you worked with us - full of patience and willingness to understand the needs - is what I appreciated most.   Jenn, you did ALL the things: taught yourself SF, cataloged requirements, corralled stakeholders, problem solved, architected iterations of approaches, and maintained urgency. I love working with you on these operational projects and this was our biggest yet! You create the kind of cross-functional partnerships where everyone engages and delivers their best. I mean this from my very grateful soul - this wouldn't have happened without you. Thanks to you, we've made game-changing strides in tracking, reporting, and understanding how WHCP most impacts the business. Such a major achievement to be proud of!\n\n92#Accenture Executive Dashboard|Team, I wanted to express my heartfelt appreciation for each and every one of you who contributed to the successful development and delivery of Accenture’s monthly executive dashboard. The collective effort and dedication you put into this project truly paid off, and I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished together. The impact of the executive dashboard cannot be overstated. Providing key details on the health and performance of the Recognize program is invaluable in driving informed decision-making and enhancing their overall strategy effectiveness. The insights and visualizations we have crafted are shared broadly across Accenture and allow leaders to grasp the narrative of recognition effortlessly, empowering them to take actions that make a meaningful difference. Melissa thank you for your exceptional contributions throughout the creation and design process. You have an unwavering commitment to excellence which is evident in your handling of the visual design and formatting, as well as your commitment to refining the dashboard through numerous iterations. Thank you for your creative thinking and patient collaboration. Ray, Noah, Will, Dylan, Jack, Greg, and Phil, thank you for extracting and compiling the data and metrics that form the foundation of the dashboard. Your meticulous attention to detail and analytical expertise ensured that the information presented was accurate, reliable, and meaningful. Cam, Liz, and Danielle thank you for your invaluable contributions to the strategic aspects of this project. Your insights and collaboration were crucial in ensuring that the dashboard remained relevant to Accenture’s needs and effectively captured the essence of its recognition program. Steve, thank you for effectively managing the execution of this project. Your leadership and coordination skills are instrumental in keeping everything on track and ensuring a seamless monthly delivery. Thank you all once again for your contributions.\n\n93#You are the Workhuman Renaissance!|Cam,  Thank you for being so supportive, proactive, and diligent once again for everything these last 2 months - from closing an incredible quarter, delivering so many process enhancements, and helping to structure another impressive board update!  I know you've been working many long nights over weeks just to get things lined up for our QBRs, SELT, Board and then all the weekly updates and efforts we are pushing across the organization.  When I floated the idea of a new way of visualizing the renewals forecast for the board meeting you were already taking over, ticking and tying numbers and making sure things were right.   I know that I've asked you to do a lot in a short period of time, and always you step up and deliver, and I want you to know how much I appreciate all that you've taken on this year.  I know we still have a long path ahead, but please take a deep breath, look around and take stock in all that you have enabled for this organization.  Multiple board members approached me last week to say thank you for the accomplishments in Q1, I let them know that none of it would have happened if it weren't for you, your leadership and your team's commitment day in and day out that really paved the way for so many things to actually come to life in the organization -- and that's on top of your day job.  I'm so grateful you're fighting on our side!\n\n94#Amazing work to Support our largest Customers!|Wow, what a fantastic couple of days together!

Onsite meetings at WHLive was a huge new goal – and we realized we did not have a way to differentiate event meetings from other meetings happening. From defining and building a whole new process, to creating custom reports in salesforce and quicksight, and ensuring the data mapping was all working – this team came together and delivered! Your attention to detail and commitment to data integrity has been incredibly valuable.  We are able to see over 350 meetings in our reporting – 118% goal attainment! Thanks to your efforts and reporting, we better understand our performance, have a model for future events, and can now focus on ways to optimize our processes. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for all that you do and your continued partnership.\n\n96#That's a Wrap.

THANK YOU from the bottom of my soul. Many of you lived through the \"challenges\" we experienced last year, and for those who didn't you heard about it, so you new the nerves were running high. Clearly working technology is always a huge help, but that's just the ticket for entry.  It's all of you who kept the flow of attendees happy, directing them to the right spots, giving them a smile and a feeling that you were there just for them. Honestly...Walmart has nothing on this team! I'm so incredibly grateful for all of your support, even when you weren't scheduled so many of you jumped in to help as needed.  Simply the best!!!\n\n99#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.

Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention.

We covered how to look at where a client is segmented, how risks are being shared in line with our No Surprises principle, understanding Renewals, what does red status mean, Engagement tracking, and Billings. Comments from the team were \"game changing\" \"we've grown up!\" \"will make this so much easier\" \"welcome the insight\"...everyone was riveted, and I look forward to having you come back for deeper dives in all areas as the team gets familiar and comfortable. It's very exciting to see the progress made thanks to your leadership.

I appreciate the multiple iterations you went through and continued sense of urgency.  I am not a fan of firedrills as I know its stressful and distracts from the day job.  I appreciate the effort you led with the rest of the group to get to a level of detail that satisfies the needs of our executives & board.

Well done and thank you, it's wonderful that this work is now complete, thank you for the teamwork!\n\n110#You're the Wind Beneath My Wings!|Thank you Cam for coming up with the inspiration for the CE keynote at Activate -  you considered options and not only came up with the theme, but then did some digging to come up with the awesome quotes and connection back to growth.  It was a brilliant idea that SPARKED a great ending to the presentation.  It might seem like a small thing, but it was a big thing for me!\n\n111#List City|A BIG thank you for all the help with our renewals campaign and ensuring our list is as clean as can be. It always makes things so much easier when we can jump on a call to talk it through. Jamie, I know how much time you put into manually updating the list and I am so grateful for that. Cam, you have been so communicative throughout this process and helped us find a solution that works best. Miguel, thank you for digging into Salesforce and pulling the contacts needed to complete this list. I'm pretty sure I ping you or ask you to jump on a quick call  once a week, lol.

I'm not carrying this baton solo, however, and I appreciate all who've remained in our group, and the new faces who've joined along the way. Thank you for your insight, expertise, energy, desire to drive Conversations forward, our practice to challenge each other and our boundaries, ask great questions, say when something doesn't make sense, and all the amazing dialogue to drive innovation for our Conversations customers. Most of all....this \"work stuff\" aside....I genuinely enjoy YOU...it makes my heart happy when we all share a laugh, tell a story, or otherwise \"be real\" with each other in our meetings.

I wanted to wholeheartedly thank you for being core members of the leads strategy and salesforce governance forum. The level of dedication and support throughout has been amazing! Week in and week out you attend, bring items for attention, provide crucial inputs, subject matter expertise, collaborate, attend specific workshops all in the interest in delivering solutions and governance for architecturally significant change, integrations, automation, process change. This spans strategic change across the phases of the lead strategy, planned critical system improvement and capability change across the front office stack - but also this group of humans has delivered a high level of transparency with the Marketing, Sales and CS teams highlighting issues/obstacles that also require significant technical solutions, governance and implementation. The data and analytics teams involvement is crucial, helping the team to understand knock on impacts to reporting and analytics – maintain the ability for the teams to measure against the strategic goals!  The leaders – Celia, Jacqui, Cam, Meghan and Mark have been instrumental in prioritising across strategic and non strategic change so the execution teams have clear priorities. 2023 phase 2 and phase 3 of the leads strategy – further automation, integrations across the stack, capability assessment and consolidation of technologies and processes, key data enrichment partner decisions (POC), Salesforce and Marketo DB clean up, retention policies, aligning to regulation, compliance and so much more fun!!!  I cannot wait 😊,  see you there!!  Gill\n\n114#Just the beginning|Thank you to everyone for participating in yesterday's Kickoff workshop for the Hub.

You all bring such drive, compassion, knowledge and strategy to our customers and teams’ needs.  You bring your whole selves to the work at hand and ensure your teams have the opportunity to thrive.

It was so inspiring to see each and every one of you show up with passion and a desire to collectively learn from each other.  We spent time building momentum around how we unlock doors with executives, gaining full adoption of the Workhuman cloud, reaching new users on the platform, increasing investment and renewing our vows with longstanding customers.  The engagement that I saw when we discussed the roles everyone plays in supporting our customers, how you partner together and the achievements that have come from those partnerships was profound.  As we often hear, it takes a village - well I'm so PROUD to be a part of this village.  The commitment demonstrated in these sessions together is what makes us great and will continue to lead us into a bright 2023, no matter the challenges, we have each other!

Thank you!\n\n122#Collaboration Cam & Chrissy|Cam & Chrissy, I wanted to thank you for all of the incredible work you have been doing to support the SCDs and our Salesforce endeavors.  You have been working so diligently to build out a way for us to get our work into SFDC and it reflect the reporting in the best way possible.  We have been zigging and zagging all over the place, but you have both approached it so professionally and with such positivity.  Cam, an extra thanks to you for helping to get some off shoots of data to support myself as well.  Thank you for being such incredible partners!  Bravo!\n\n123#Making a List & Checking it Twice!|Full credit to Kevin for reminding us that even Santa makes a list and checks it twice! 😊 HUGE thank you to this group for discussing how to ensure we pull accurate, targeted email contact lists to drive our Season of Giving, Employee Appreciation Day & World Gratitude Day campaigns.

And thank you for being core contributors to the post mortem deck and discussion -C\n\n125#World Gratitude Day - 2022 Program|Team - I wanted to take a moment to step back and recognize the nearly four month journey we've been on together to deliver this year's customer-facing World Gratitude Day toolkit and campaign. From the onset, this group set the bar high - first in listening to and actioning customer-facing learnings from last year and second, in taking foundational steps to double our award delivery capacity, while opening up new award delivery channels via CustomeriO. There was extensive teamwork, ongoing cross-department collaboration, and an exceptional week on week approach to communicating, forecasting demand, and inspiring confidence across the teams. In summary, results across all benchmarks from last year improved significantly. And while we wait to see the final impact on Billings, take heart in knowing you all defined a new way of working together across Customer Success, Product, Human Engagement, Engineering, and Marketing. With gratitude (albeit a few days after Sept 21 :) -C\n\n126#The best support!|Cam, Jamie, and Judith - Thank you all for gathering for an internal regroup and then a client-facing discussion with BMS.  Due to a recent acquisition of another WH client, there are some internal moving parts to decide and finalize.  We were able to help the team understand the current state of Turning Point's agreement and what the future state could look like.  As BMS is one of our more strategic clients, I truly appreciate the partnership in ensuring a smooth transition.  We are their trusted advisor and they value us for certain.  Thank you for all that you do!\n\n127#Leaders who Get Stuff Done!|On this World Gratitude Day, I want to this fantastic group of leaders to know how much you are appreciated and how much impact you have for the team, our customers, and our business. You lead team members, you work through issues, you guide and coach, you recruit talented humans, you motivate customers and make sure that customers’ voices are heard by the rest of the company.  Thank you for being you, bringing your talent every day, and getting “stuff” done.  With gratitude....\n\n128#Cam has a Halo|Cam, thanks for a great week and month.   From continuing to operationalize our metrics and lead the crack renewals and ops team, to pulling together information, content, board slides, to having your hands on so many projects to move us forward.  You’re at the center of so much and always willing to jump in. Thanks for all of your energy, intellect and drive that you share with all of us.    When you were in the office this week and presented (last minute) to the all-hands huddle on World Gratitude Day and the activities and approaches in place and several people commented “Cam has a halo!” . Maybe it was about being backlit on Zoom, but you surely have a halo with everything you do for all of us.  Thanks Cam.\n\n129#Top Work|Jamie & Cam, Thanks for always assisting/supporting with all kinds of aspects of new/existing business for our clients regardless if it is a request of Demo's, contractual agreement/renewals ,minimum commitment, amendments it's always delivered prompt & efficiently with a Big Smile.  It's a joy working together with both of you, once again Thanks! Steen\n\n130#Teamwork Takes it to Launch!|Thanks to an amazing team for making the Citizens' Celebrations Launch such a huge success. It was quite the journey. Robyn and Cam, you tee'd it up for me perfectly! Dan and Matt, you were Launch Rock Stars! No matter how many changes, customizations, challenges came your way, you tackled each one with enthusiasm and grace. Claire, Nuvs and Cam, just 6 days prior to the scheduled launch, when Citizens was ready to pull the plug, you all dropped everything and jumped on a call to collaborate and brainstorm creative solutions to overcome each of Citizens' objections, and then Mike, you came sliding in at the end to answer their last and final request to provide a reference from another financial institution. Joyce, thanks for your creative mind, your guidance, and all of the work you did with Celeste and the Citizens' Comms Team to knock it out of the park post launch. With 425 Nominations and 178 Congratulations in the books, just 7 business days after Launch, Citizens was thrilled!  Woohoo!  Thanks again! We couldn't have done it without each other!\n\n131#Lunching, Learning, Demanding, Planning ...|... and Innovating! Team, my thanks to this group for your ongoing and persistent efforts to bring World Gratitude Day to market successfully across all dimensions of customer experience, program value, and execution. This group has carved out important time to cross-functionally ideate, plan, and execute. Through this week's (and the ongoing) Lunch and Learns and Demand Planning reviews we are demonstrating a great model of communications and shared goals. Onward and with gratitude! -C\n\n132#Necessity drives Innovation|As Vanilla Ice said, \"If there's a problem, I'll solve it.\" - Team outstanding work identifying new pathways for supporting anticipated World Gratitude Day customer volume. We know this has big potential to drive Billings growth in 2H, and we know that we had to overcome challenges in capacity and experience from last year. This team has mobilized around both, and been innovative in exploring Human Engagement/CustomerIO as a channel for non-monetary awards so we maximize our Team Awards capacity and experience on the day itself. I appreciate the pragmatic and speedy way you all have approached this, weighing pros and cons, and keeping the customer experience front, center, and the driving factor of our decisions. Thank you all for being dynamic, responsive, and resilient! Onward! -C\n\n133#SMTP to AWS migration|The last few weeks saw the culmination of many months of work with the completion of the migration of all client SMTP/email delivery services to AWS from our last physical data centre. This took a momentous amount of planning and coordination between multiple internal WH teams both Cloud and Client Services and then with our clients themselves. The level of cooperation displayed between all teams ensured, most importantly the uninterrupted delivery of client email which number in the 100s of thousand per day and ultimately the successful delivery of the project and is no small feat. Our new AWS home will allow us to take full advantage of all that AWS has to offer providing a stable and robust platform to build and grow our product upon. Well done to all involved and enjoy your reward!\n\n134#Just getting started!|Cam - what a great way to kick off our partnership on the client-level dashboards.  Thank you for taking the time to walk our team through all the hard work and thought that's been put into the Gainsight project.  So many helpful insights and so much to look forward to as we move forward!\n\n135#SOLI Analysis Accuracy!|Cam, thank you so much for jumping in and helping me out with the Corteva SOLI analysis. Despite everything else you had going on, you stepped right up and taught me a new formula in Excel that drastically reduced the amount of time and manual work we would've needed to struggle through. Multiple calls and plenty of Slack messages. We were able to provide a quick and accurate resolution for the client, and prevent anything else from going wrong. I appreciate you immensely!\n\n136#Scavenger Hunt Heros!|Team! Way to go on being the first team to complete the CS Wiki scavenger hunt. We have so many valuable resources out on the CS Wiki, sometimes you just have to hunt a little to find them. Thank you for your enthusiastic participation and great job finding all of the items in the hunt so quickly!\n\n137#Cam to the rescue (again)!|Cam, thank you so much for your help on analyzing the Corteva SOLI changes. You are always so helpful even if the issue is out of your scope of work and always have the customer front of mind. I appreciate everything you do and can't thank you enough!\n\n138#For the love of Jackson....|Cam,   Thank YOU, thank you so very much for all of the support, effort, work that you have done to investigate what we can do for Jackson Natl Life and how we can come to an agreement.  It is certainly not easy when a client comes back after an implementation and \"has a different understanding\" on how something (YoS Cash Awards) works.    It would be easy to \"walk away\", but you have rolled up your sleeves and worked with Scott, Amy, Rachel, me and others to understand what we can do within system/restrictions, the billing aspect and how we get this resolved.   I am most grateful to work with you on this quite unique situation- all for the love of our clients!!  I SOOOO appreciate YOU!\n\n139#Challenging the Status Quo|Cam – I love seeing meeting invites from you on topics I know will make a significant impact to both our team and our customers as we look to scale. Today’s meeting is a shining example of that. I want you to know that your mindset to challenge the status quo, to improve efficiently and to grow Customer Success strategically does not go unnoticed. We are at a stage we need to think differently, think boldly and take risks and it’s amazing and a pleasure to watch your ideas and your progress to achieve this big results!\n\n140#UMGC RFP 91928|Congrats Team, UMGC announced today they have reselected WH once again as preferred vendor for another year, the RFP process has been at some stages intensive and demanding but you all kept the cool. We are also delighted our Favorite PM Kendra Fray remains with Client Services . Once again Thanks, Enjoy! SJ\n\n141#Thank you for continued success and reliability!|Cam & Jamie understand the needs of the customer while also adhering to WH's finance, business and legal internal policies.  This is an extremely difficult task to meet from both ends but they do this with ease. The partnership between Customer Success and Finance has grown significantly and I know I can always count on both of them for assistance/direction with understanding the customer's current situation; and their additional context is helpful with drafting new order forms and contractual conditions that fulfill customer immediate needs & WH policies and procedures simultaneously which ultimately renders greater cash flow, revenue recognition and overall profit to WH as a whole.  Additionally, their knowledge and continued support with communicating team awards (which tends to be more popular in the last year) and providing finance with the correct documents to properly review and approve these team awards have created a more efficient and effective internal request process. Above all, they also understand the finance, revenue and legal implications when proposing a new customer request to finance which is quite admirable.  Thank you for always being an integral part of WH's front end (and back end) operations process!  I look forward to working with both of you more in the future!\n\n142#Teaching Me So Much with IBM|Patrick, Jason and Cam and have been so amazing with showing me the ropes for IBM (and Kyndryl). They have all been so patient if I didn't understand something, always willing to hop on a call at a moments notice to help walk through any problems and have taught me so much about Conversations in general! It is both challenging and fun and I'm really grateful that I have this opportunity to help with IBM and learn from these guys. Thank you!\n\n143#Best in the game|Cam and Jamie - you two are the best duo in the game- the Chris Paul and Devin Booker of renewals and upsell! Thank you for all the time, effort, and negotiations you are pouring into the team's current opportunities. From the many hours going back and forth with JetBlue, to strategizing on our approach for Gulfstream, to handling billing mishaps at Point32, and so much more -you both truly do it all. Your passion for supporting our customers shines through with every decision and proposal you make. Thanks for all the continued support you give myself, the team and our customers!\n\n144#Championing the codes|Cam and Danielle, thank you both for pushing forward the comp codes for Quicken Loans/Rocket Companies. This was a complex situation with sales signing comps, a move from Growth to Strategic, and a very persistent program owner. Rocket Companies is looking to rethink the way they strategically approach to the work the Amazement Team is doing companywide in 2022 and forward.  In addition to recognition, they are striving towards being the Culture Champions and thought our conference would be the best place to further their knowledge. You were able to secure three passes and the Rocket Companies team was more than excited. Gretchen said - \"THANK YOU! This is FANTASTIC! I am super excited to attend this event and meet this team in person. I truly appreciate the passes!\" I am so appreciative of your partnership and persistence on this. Thank you both for all the help and for being great teammates!\n\n145#Booz Cruise|Thank you Meisha-Ann, Jose, Sarah, Penny, Nuvs, Jaime, and Cam for all the hard work and prep time invested to prepare for and deliver the Booz Allen finalist presentation this morning. The conversation was quite in-depth, covering all aspects of our partnership. I'm confident that we succeeded in demonstrating existing value and helping uncover opportunities to improve their program design and benefit from our expertise moving forward. And considering the extended length of the discussion, I think we can officially re-categorize that from a mere 'presentation' to a 'Booz cruise'! Thanks again, James\n\n146#Thank you for the Conversations perspective!|Hi Cam,  Thank you so much for taking the time for our 1:1 meeting in my first few weeks here.  I especially appreciate you sharing how you work on the upsell of Conversations, and how our teams will partner. I hope there is much more work in this area in 2022, than in customer disputes...haha.... :)\n\n147#PPT Takeover|Cam, I cannot thank you enough for your continued partnership in Customer Strategy.  You have been extremely helpful in every way, especially when it comes to the weekly PPT.  The work that you have done preparing the documents and sending to Chris has been amazing, and your support has enabled me to focus on my new role.  I really appreciate everything that you do!\n\n148#Regional Customer Account Help!|Thanks so much Cam & Mick for helping me to find information on one of our US Customers, which is part of a UK HQ'd company. Both of you were very willing to help bring me some context & point me in the right direction. I look forward to hopefully igniting some interesting conversations with the wider company!\n\n149#Conversations says hello to IBM!|Congratulations, team, on delivering the last significant piece of functionality for IBM - Annual Reflections!  This experience, along with all of the other milestones delivered for IBM, is a moment worth celebrating.    IBMers have been front of mind for this team for over a year.  You have all consistently gone above and beyond to deliver for the customer and Workhuman.  Your product and support experiences touch the entire IBM organization, making the employee experience at IBM exceptional and more human.   Be proud of the work you have done to reach this massive milestone - we are!  Cheers, The Chris' (French & Campbell)\n\n150#Making it all work|I want to recognize the great work you do day in and out. You’ve been critical to making all of the pieces work together for the team and our customers.  From incubating, and now growing, our operational capabilities, to building tracking for team awards and driving Celebrations opportunities, to building a scalable renewals process which is smoothly, you’ve led the way in us scaling for growth.  You’ve also been the go-to person for information for me, for Board slides, for other teams. Many of these requests are last-minute, sometimes only-partially defined and yet partner with requestor (often me!) to refine the ask and get us the right information quickly.  Despite having so many balls in the air, you always seem to bring a sense of calm to the work and ensure it all gets done well.   Thank you for your leadership and work in making the gears of our business turn together to generate success.\n\n151#A long RFP comes to a close|Team – now that we have an actual signed contract from Sensata, I can officially thank the group that participated in their RFP process.  My intention was to send this recognition moment a longggg time ago.  The whole RFP process started before I was even employed at Workhuman and who knew it would be 1.5 years later before things were official.  Not only did Sensata decide to renew for 3 more years, but they are bringing on a full Service Anniversary program for the first time and they went all in on Life Events/Community Celebrations.  Danielle – you are definitely my most overdue recognition ever.   You helped us prep for this RFP, had a presence on our client meetings, but more importantly you’ve been a great leader, coach and friend to me since I started here.  As a remote new hire, I can't tell you how important all of your guidance has been.  I wouldn’t be where I am today without you.  Cam – you have your hand in pretty much everything.  So many of my client presentation talking points are taken directly from you.  Thank you for all your work building the RFP deck, helping sell them on Celebrations, the many pricing conversations we had, and everything you did to get this deal over the finish line.  Dave – it goes a long way when we can have our leaders participate on client calls.  Thank you for your presence on our RFP finalist meeting (December 2020!) and showing them that there’s an entire team at Workhuman invested in their success.  I appreciate you all!\n\n152#A Manager you can rely on!|Cam, thank you so much for all of your help during my first month! Your knowledge of the internal business processes has been so helpful and you are so quick  to respond to any questions I have. You've made me feel like a part of the team since day 1, thank you!\n\n153#Analytics Rockstars|Team, thanks so much for the quick turnaround on data and thoughtful dialogue around our customer marketing programs! It felt like a great example of how powerful cross-department collaborative efforts can be. So thanks again for all your hard work we really appreciate it!\n\n154#Cleared for LIFT off|It was only fitting the title was a bad pun. Cam and Danielle - thank you for all your work over the last year that led to a very productive and exciting JetBlue call with the executive sponsor today. You have advocated on their behalf and gone the extra mile to show our partnership. Today for the first time in many months, our executive sponsor acknowledged that and as a result we have a really promising path forward with JetBlue. I don't want to jinx anything, but it sounds like we will be working with them for many years to come. Just as important, they are ready to re-engage through standing meetings and work with us on strategy. All the little (and BIG) things you've been advocated for and pushed forward over the last year during their time of need are paying off. Jamie - you did a great job of coming in and reinforcing our commitment to the partnership and making the team feel heard. It was clear that Icema loved your moment of human connection talking about your destination wedding and your great experience with JetBlue. Your suggestions and reassurance made for a very happy JetBlue team...and maybe free flights for you?! Thanks again to this A team for all your hard work and support on JetBlue!\n\n155#Way to lead the group!|Cam! So appreciate your help in the customer strategy growth breakout this afternoon. You took it upon yourself to setup the meeting, drive the slides, make edits and capture notes as we dug in as a group. You did a fantastic job leading the team through passionate discussions and kept us on time and productive. Excited with what we accomplished today and it was due to you stepping up and in - thank you!\n\n156#Customer Strategy People and Culture Offsite|Thank you so much for your participation and contributions at our recent Customer Strategy People and Culture offsite.  With our work environment changing so radically and the personal stress mounting, you all volunteered to be part of the solution.  You came with open minds and a solution-oriented outlook to address the main feedback areas on behalf of your respective team members.  From video communications and updated team rhythms to self-care habits and cross-departmental relations, your ideas sprung forth into actionable plans.  I can't wait for your peers to hear about them.  Thank you not only for the great work but for the positive attitude and growth mindset you brought to the discussions.  I'm very grateful to be on this journey alongside such caring teammates.\n\n157#Good cop bad cop routine!|Cam- I have to say, we have truly mastered the bad cop, good cop routine! Your role being the bad cop, is by far the hardest. But you my friend, absolutely kill it every time! Most recently, we had to opportunity to present to Hershey’s PMs, new Program Owner, and the old Program Owner (who isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. We had a challenge to help them truly understand the value in frequent recognition, not limiting their employee experience and to continue to deliver a best in class recognition program. The old PO flat out said “I am at the point that I want to give people the ability to give 4 awards and thats it!” You masterfully explained why that is not a great experience, and how they could better leverage the tools available to them. You respectfully questioned their thinking, and helped us get to a place where they are willing to separate out their programs to ensure sales incentives and safety awards are set up and budgetted for separately. We have our work cut out for us, but I wanted to take a moment to thank you for always being there to help deliver excellence to our customers- and for allowing me to play the better role of good cop too:-)\n\n158#Is there any way.......|Kevin and Cam! we chatted this week to see if there was any way we could look at the folks who engaged in the WGD toolkit and see if there was business impact. You went back and pulled together a series of amazing stats! This was so helpful to understand how and who we impacted with this work and helps fuel conversations about smart investments in marketing moving forward. AWESOME work! Always a pleasure partnering with you.\n\n159#Weekly Customer Strategy Operations Meeting|Team, I want to celebrate you all for the role you are playing in making our weekly customer operations meetings such a success.  I was reflecting last night on how far we have come recently in visualizing all the facets of customer strategy in real time and looking at them in a way that helps us take action and drive strategy.  Every week the views get getter and that's because you're all focused on continuous improvement and actionable intel.  Thank you for the great work!\n\n160#Customer Operations|Cam, thanks for all the wonderful work you have been doing lately to pull together key insights, reports, results and activities within Customer Strategy.  You really understand the nuance of our business and the key levers we need to focus on for success which makes working with you on strategic initiatives easy and fun.  You're doing excellent work here.  Thank you!\n\n161#Allstar Team for Analytics|All, as Jack and I presented to the Customer Strategy Leadership Team today, it really hit me how powerful your incredible work and insight has been. Your focus to illuminate customer data that really matters, helps us move the business forward and demonstrate the power of recognition is unparalleled.  I feel very blessed to be working alongside all of you and learn something from you all each time we meet.  The tremendous amount of work you all have done and are continuing to do is remarkable.  Cheers to all of you!\n\n162#Dream team|Cam and Mark - the operations office hours dream team! Thank you both for all the help you given me over the last few weeks with my various requests at the operations office hours. Cam, thank you for for walking me through creating an opportunity,  creating a Customer Success Plan report, helping me move forward the Quicken Celebrations opportunity, and everything in between. Mark, thank you for always offering to dive in to 6sense with me and showing me trends at Quicken Loans, Hershey etc. It has been so helpful to see areas of interest and opportunity in my customers and learn about new personas. You always go the extra mile to give me tools to grow my customers. Thank you both for all you do!\n\n163#Customer Ops Evolution|Dave, Cam and Kevin, I just wanted to send a short note to call out the amazing progress that we have made over the last few months with customer reporting and operational diligence. Through your collective hard work, we are really rounding into a nice dashboard for running the business along all of the different customer segments and key initiatives. Progress like this is an iterative process, with improvements made every week. You all tackled the challenge with a positive can-do attitude and a spirit of continuous improvement. Thank you!\n\n164#Collaboration, planning and customer rock stars!|Team,  Thank you all for your participation in our Onsite / Offsite this week.   This dedicated block of time helped us sync up, reconnect, share ideas and plan for the remainder of the 2021 as we prepare for 2022 planning.  Even though some of us were virtual, you all brought your full selves to the meetings and we had meaningful conversations with clear actions.     Jay, Danielle, Jose and Kara, your SWOT analyses of your businesses was insightful and helped us see the broader opportunities and challenges; balancing the broader themes with your books of business.  Mick, you added to that with context around the Client Services segmentation and support approaches.  Amy, you brought great insights into our biggest engagements that helped level-set us.  Rich, your update on scaling launches and your creative ideas for shortening the window sparked great discussions.  Erin, your view of the product update process helped us see path to better collaboration; an AHA moment!  Kerri, thank you for bringing HX context into the discussion and being a great partner in the meeting.  Cam, thanks for the deep and broad update of operations and approaches, not to mention the awesome idea to have a camera on in the room as well as each person’s camera.  Michelle, we now have the data that shows that you and your team are doing heroic levels of work and started to plan out to adjust our plans to support them.  And Dana, thank you for all of your support, coordination, planning and ideas to make it all work.    While I’m eager to get together in person as a group, this was a great chance to spend focused time with all of you and have some laughs. Thank your for time (into the evening for Jose and Mick!), creativity, and partnership.  While some of you may not be great bowlers, you are all great leaders and humans and I appreciate you all.  Onward and upward!\n\n165#Better Educating to Our Future Customers|Dan, Amanda, Jess, Alan, Mark, Dave, Hari, Marcy, Corinne, Naomi, Meisha-Ann, Cam, Jay, Melanie, Amanda and Sarah - I wanted to take a moment to appreciate each of your contributions this past quarter as they've been key to developing assets that better educate our future customers. First and foremost - Dan, Amanda and Jess: thank you for your collaborative spirit and support through multiple iterations; the important and skillful work you do brings everything together! Alan, Mark, Dave & Hari: I want to thank you for the relentless focus you bring to each of our WHiQ slide reviews; your diverse perspectives and ability to communicate complexity in simple terms is what makes these meetings so informative and productive! Last but not least, Marcy, Corinne, Naomi, Meisha-Ann, Cam, Jay, Melanie, Amanda and Sarah, thank you for your deep partnership helping to create a number of new slides (soon to be made available on seismic) that beautifully illustrates what a 3 year partnership with Workhuman entails. Together, we've made so much progress - yet our work is seemingly never done...always something we can further improve upon. That being said, I wanted to hit pause and take this moment to let each of you know how truly grateful I am for your friendship and continued partnership, all in service of better educating our future customers!\n\n166#Collective efforts|Humans (see what I did there haha), a massive thank you for all of your help the last couple of weeks to help improve non award activity billing and specifically interactions with our customers. I could be preparing to create a min commit invoice or a subscription invoice and reached out to all of you for assistance. We've gone over the length clients have left on contracts? (if less than a year obviously we cannot bill for the full year) how are they at making payments? are we able to get new amendments drawn up? has a client paid their latest subscription invoice? why a client have pushed back? The past few weeks there seems to be an increase in all of these queries and all of have really helped out with solving them. We have also had to have numerous calls on these, shoutout to Danielle for jumping on a call with Stephen and myself at 8am US time! Non award billing is really growing and you are all helping the process easier as we go along. Thank you all and enjoy!\n\n167#Broad Comms Channel Review|Cam and Chris! Greatly appreciate the time this week running through the progress on the 'broad customer comms channel' initiative on the strategy board. Being a highly cross-functional project, it is key we share updates and blockers on an ongoing basis to continue to chug along! I appreciate your feedback on pushing through some roadblocks, thinking through ways to accelerate, and the respectful dialogue and insights to continue to make the most of our content. You are both rock stars, and I very much appreciate the partnership. Cheers!\n\n168#Killing it!|Cam, thanks for the awesome demo of Community Celebrations at bp this morning.  We have done a few of these together now and your interaction and enthusiasm with these clients spills over!  Love the stories and how you truly bring this to life.  This is the last WH Cloud Solutions to switch on for bp and they were very excited about moving forward.  You are such a fantastic team player and appreciate all of your great work.\n\n169#Partner in Crime!|Cam..where do I even begin? I will start by thanking you for your continued partnership every single day. Whether it be the support you give the team, or the day to day interactions we have on min commits, renewals, opportunities, growth initiatives..the list goes on and on! Most recently, we had quite a large and complex escalation for one of our customers. I was at a doctor appointment when I received an email from the customer so couldn't get on a call, and there you were minutes later jumping in to ensure not only Kenny had the support he needed, but also that we got on a call with the customer immediately. You gathered the internal troops required to fix the issue on my behalf, and ensured the team had the right leadership support. I can always depend on you, and that is why you are my true partner in crime! I am so appreciative of everything that you do, and the partnership that we have built over the last two years. You truly are the best partner I could ask for! Thanks again!\n\n170#I'm sorry your neighbors heard this first...|I hate to admit this but I like to overshare soo... this morning I thought to myself - wow, people must think I'm obsessed with Cam by how often I say \"HE'S THE BEST!!\" I promptly spiraled realizing I tell everyone and their neighbor how much I appreciate you - AND NOT YOU!  So this is incredibly overdue but CAM!!!, you have no idea how grateful I am for you.  Your leadership is exactly what we needed to create alignment between Customer Success and Sales Ops.  Your dedication and enthusiasm for process improvement and consistency makes my operations heart skip a beat!  I'm so excited for this partnership and all the goodness to come!\n\n171#Taking time for Discovery!|All! Thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy days to participate in discovery calls for the customer database growth and governance project. Everyone offered terrific perspective and helped the team get a well rounded view of the current process and areas or opportunity. Excited to share the findings more broadly and appreciate you all!\n\n172#The webinar dream team!|Cam, Erin and Evan you truly are the webinar dream team. Despite very busy schedules, competing priorities, well deserved pto and more, you all make time to help bring these customer webinars to life. The amount of effort that goes into the creation of the content, the presentation, and the follow up resources and activities is no small feat. I couldn't ask for a better team to partner with on these events. Thank you for all the work you put into each and every one of our customer webinars and for making this program so fun to work on!\n\n173#Bringing it at Baker Hughes!|Congratulations to this terrific team!  Everyone brought their \"A\" game to get the BH team on board the WH Cloud train.  After a very long time of bringing up Conversations and Celebrations, BH finally agreed to listen to all the applications.  Cam, you did an amazing job in connecting with the team.  The demos of the solutions hit right on all of their needs and objectives.  Such a great job!  Lauren, thanks so much for all the information on communications and all the ways we are able to assist them in getting the Workhuman word out to all level of employees.  Christa, thanks for all the work you put into Baker Hughes each and every day.  You do such a wonderful job of keeping Workhuman front of mind at BH.  It was such a fruitful and productive gathering and thanks to ALL for all of your hard work.  Enjoy the long weekend.\n\n174#Teamwork can solve any mystery!|We were able to solve one of the largest art heists of this century through tenacity, cunning and puzzle-solving skills! Thanks to you all for taking the time to participate in a the team building zoom call.  With a host who had an off-the-charts energy level it was great to take the time to jump in, turn on those creative juices and have a few laughs. And special thanks to Dana for coordinating our host and schedules.  Looking forward to our next team-building meeting to be IN PERSON!\n\n175#Thinking again...and again and again|Team, what an adventure we have been! Diving into our Salesforce CRM from a customer and customer marketing perspective has brought our unique perspectives together to envision a data structure that can support our evolving organization. This week we started the process of mapping over 18 customer contact fields into three streamlined fields that will support our understanding of our relationship with contacts at individual customer organizations and streamline data management. This would would not have been possible without dedicated support from Chris on the Sales Ops side, continuous feedback from Cam and the vision that Jill and Mark have. Proud to be part of this work. Thank you for being great partners in this endeavor.\n\n176#It Takes A Village|I wanted to thank each of you for stepping up while I was out on maternity leave, and supporting my team and customers while I was out! The saying it takes a village is so true, as you all had to take on a new role, in addition to the every day work you already had on your plates! From having 1 on 1's, to joining customer calls and account reviews, to being an escalation point or just being available to answer a question, you each played an instrumental role in supporting my team.  I so appreciate each one of you, and being able to take off and enjoy time with Jackson, knowing the team was in great hands! So on behalf of myself and Jackson, thank you!!!!\n\n177#Incredible Simpson Strong-Tie Client Partners|Steen and Cam, thank you both for your support and customer centric thinking as you helped navigate taking Simpson-Strong-Tie to the next level!  This new program is the first step as they get back to their original vision of building a global program.  Hari and I promised them years ago one of our key differentiators is we are committed to helping our clients constantly get better.  I so appreciate how you both have supported and listened to SST and helped them get this new program done.  We can never have too much of that so thank you both for your inspired leadership thru action.\n\n178#Another Terrific Customer Webinar... Check!|Team, terrific work on the latest customer webinar, 'Inspiring Leaders to Become Recognition Advocates.' Great reach with 41 registrants across 37 different accounts (like BMS, Lam Research, Lockheed, Booz Allen, Citizens and MORE!). I'm so excited to see how the post event toolkit performs as well. Thanks to this group for thinking outside of the box to provide useful tools for our customers and being data-centric and sharing post event insights so swiftly. This program is on fire! Awesome teamwork all!\n\n179#Life Event Champions|A huge thank you for your recent insight and knowledge sharing to help set Life Events at bp up for success and take it to the next level. Your input, brainstorming & resources for the upcoming review has been a huge help and I am excited to see where this goes next. Thank you for sharing feedback on what's resonated well when presenting to other customers and also the best way to position community celebrations into the conversation.\n\n180#Celebrating Celebrations!|Thanks for your work on the Celebrations Suite customer adoption project and for the comprehensive update to the executive team this morning. In addition to the many direct benefits to the Celebrations Suite, this project also shows a viable model for intentionally driving the adoption of new products across the board. Well done!\n\n181#So grateful for your partnership!|Cam, today’s exec presentation was a great reminder of why I am so grateful to have your partnership in driving all things Celebrations. Talking through all the initiatives and what the team has accomplished brought home for me what a pivotal role you’ve had. Running the numbers, talking pricing strategy, coordinating with the other teams, and of course playing a key role on the front lines with customers talking up the value and demoing constantly. Your feedback and insights always are a great boost of energy for me.  Thank you for joining me on this fun journey and for all the virtual high fives. Here’s to many more.\n\n182#Life Events and Community Celebrations|Rachel and Cam, amazing update today at the executive progress meeting on Life Events and Community Celebrations! This recognition, however, is for the months of work that went into those results you presented.  You really embraced our new \"incubate\" approach to launching new products and the learn fast/startup mindset in finding the winning formula.  The strategy to drive real world value from the product, demonstrate it to customers and surround them with multi-channel marketing resulted in over 50% conversion rate from free Life Event trials to paid subscriptions.  Very encouraging results and the result of months of effort.  Well done!\n\n183#Advancing at Avanade|Cam, so great to partner with you recently on Celebrations for Avanade. This is a new client for me and setting the stage for future growth and extended partnership were enhanced greatly with your input. Really appreciate the time you gave this opportunity. Your delivery and style really made them sit up. Thank you.\n\n184#The 4 Musketeers?|Cam, Ana and Mark! Seems like the last 4 weeks its been the 4 of us in meetings about ALL the things; reporting, lead scoring, contact roles, database discovery... the list goes on! While we have many different projects converging at once and the to do list seems endless, there is no one I'd rather be on this roller coaster ride. This team is thoughtful, innovative and pushes the envelope to ensure we have the best possible experience for our customers! Cannot wait to see what value these projects bring and THANK YOU!\n\n185#WOW, WHAT A LIGHTNING brain STORM|Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for your participation in our SFDC Lightning migration prep sessions!  Your input will be crucial to the success of this transition.  Change can be tough but with partners like you, I'm incredibly excited for what's to come!\n\n186#Renewals Scrum!|Team! Awesome meeting yesterday as we continue to dig into optimizing renewals across the customer business. We had a terrific discussion about types of accounts, scenarios and the 'menu of options' we could deploy against those scenarios. Excited about the progress we continue to make and the opportunity in the future! Thrilled to be working with such a great team.\n\n187#Life Events - closed|Now that Life Events is officially closed won for Stepan Company, I owe you both a long overdue thank you for all your help over the past few months.  Mark, it's obvious how passionate you are about the work you do.  You're a kid in a candy store, but with data and analytics.  Between the targeted ads, email campaigns and our microsite, you got the client interested and wanting to learn more about their Life Events product before I even started having conversations with them.  Cam, you've always been there to help with messaging and you provide the data and facts to back up everything you say.  You both really helped me build a data story about the impact these Life Events moments are having on their program and employee engagement.  It was a true team effort from the very beginning, which resulted in the client not even questioning their decision to keep Life Events.  It was an obvious decision for them.  Thank you again for all your help !  The CSMs are lucky to have you as partners!\n\n188#Thank you!|Cam - it has been a long year for my customers in the retail/goods & services world and you have been an incredible partner to both them and myself. You have a very full plate, but somehow find the time to have conversations on all the things - min commits, renewals, celebrations bundle. Each time you speak to a customer your passion and commitment for our product shine through. You truly believe in what we do and the culture transformation it brings to our customers and our customers see that and value that. Thank you for running with the UNUM renewal, the PVH renewal, the WestJet renewal, the Travelport sunset, the Bruce Power min commit convos, and everything in between. It has been great to learn from you through these conversations and I look forward to all the good that is to come from them!\n\n189#Expert Advice & Amazing Partnership|Thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to dig in with Customer Marketing and Darcy to understand specific details around renewals. Your feedback, thoughts and experience is incredibly valuable to help us understand the right situations. I can't thank you both enough, we have so much great information to work with after these meetings!!\n\n190#Douglas Elementary School Pilot - Time to Learn!|We're about to embark on an exciting journey for our Beyond the Workplace ambitions.  Thank you to all of you for your efforts in getting us here and your future efforts in making this a successful test pilot.  This opportunity with Douglas Elementary School began due to incredible heart and passion of you Alice.  You saw a school system in need of appreciation and inclusion and opened the doors given your personal connections into it. From there, we started to assemble the dream team, Cam, Lynette, and Judith who will undoubtedly make this pilot a success (of learnings, strategic insight, and infused positivity).  And Hillary - masterful job on streamlining the contract, as this is quite new for both parties and the aim was to make the agreement as frictionless as possible. Thank you also to Lauren, Amy, and Jim for their leadership and support along the way.  Now it's time to get in the classroom and start our learnings!\n\n191#Citi Branches Out!!|A huge thanks and congratulations to this team for successfully getting Citi Live on Community Celebrations this week!! From our Q4 Business Review meeting where we explored the various ways the Citi Program Team works with internal business segments on requests for Citi Gratitude, we learned that many \"programs\" are turned away because they are more participation vs performance driven---Lynette suggested the team consider Community Celebrations as a great way to bring those groups in while reinforcing Citi Gratitude. That started the chain of events leading to Go-Live this week. Key calls/meetings/demos with Rachel, Cam and Tim early on convinced Citi it was the right course of action. Project Team calls with Rich, Dan, Amy, Jay and Eileen got us organized internally to deliver.  Communications planning with Tirrill and Lynette provided Citi the tools to launch to Managers. Technical and Production Support assistance throughout from Rich, Tim, Michelle, Brian, and Stephen was critical this week. Alan and Mikael assisting with Pendo support. Steve assisting with overall Renewal and Finance coordination as usual. Thank you All for making this successful and we hope this will be one of many programs they will add to CC down the line!\n\n192#Happy Employee Appreciation Day, dude!|Cam - I've been thinking that even though we work together the most, I can't even remember the last time I recognized you. In a way, it's a sign of friendship and trust. It's already understood that we appreciate each other...but that doesn't mean it's not needed. I am very thankful for your perspectives, your sense of humor, your drive and passion, and all your amazing ideas. One of the best things about partnering with you is that we can challenge each other to be better, while at the same time you are always there to listen. Whether it's navigating IBM, trying to fix problems or get things done for a customer, or collaborating on the customer webinar series, working with you is always fun and inspiring. On this day of employee appreciation, I hope you know you are valued and all your amazing work is seen. The Dude abides!\n\n193#Onboarding Heroes|Hi Michael, Amanda, Casey, Orlagh, Eileen, Mark, Dave, Cam, and Rick! I want to thank you for making time during the past few weeks to participate in my onboarding process for the new Sales & Customer Success Enablement Strategist role. I'm look forward to working closely with you on our customer renewal and YOS / symbolic awards efforts. Thank you again for sharing your expertise to help me transition into this exciting new position! James\n\n194#Lending Your Expertise|Thank you both for joining today's call with Avantor.  Cam - you did an amazing job walking through Life Events and Community Celebrations.  You really painted an tangible picture of how important these awards are to build and foster connections among colleagues.  And thanks for inviting me to share a picture of my puppy to bring it home!  They are definitely interested and I will be continuing this conversation in subsequent calls.  And thanks for also researching and providing a visual to show the recent approval change that they had inquired about.  Erin - thank you for diving right into a configuration conundrum that we are currently working on with Spend Management.  You immediately put your CSM hat right back on and stepped in to identify the next step needed to bring that to resolution.  And thank you as well for walking through the details of role based reporting.  We'll now move forward to putting this in sandbox so they can determine how to best use this functionality and who to give it to.  Mostly I appreciated the partnership you both exhibited both with me and with the PM.  You were so engaging, so supportive and so helpful.  So thanks my friends, for Lending Your Expertise!\n\n195#Passing Checkpoint 1|Yesterday, IBM Checkpoint launched to over 300,000 IBMers in 93 countries and our largest ever Conversations program took off. When I was choosing an appropriate award reason for celebrating your team accomplishment, the description for Innovation = Imagination + Determination reads: \"Resilience: rebounding with courage from setbacks and adversity when facing difficult situations.  Calm under pressure and positively adapting.\" What a wonderful description of the journey you all have been on these past few months.  Many people go their whole lives without working on a project like this that touches so many people all over the world with incredible complexity.  Take a breath, take a moment and let it sink in. You did it!  The feedback has been wonderful.  In an internal communication amongst the top HR leaders at IBM, quotes such as \"\"After playing around with the new Checkpoint Experience I just wanted to say I LOVE IT and it looks to be exactly what I was looking for... I look forward to setting my first goals and soliciting way too much constructive criticism!\". And a resounding testimonial to each of you...\"We do have a fantastic partner in Workhuman, and they are just as excited to launch as we are.\"  Congratulations on this amazing milestone and thank you each for your critical role in making this dream real!\n\n196#Beyond the Workplace Learning Expedition!|Thank you so much for participating in this exciting learning expedition with the Douglas team today!  Cam, thank you for jumping in to fill in and demo the product last minute!  You are a pro, and I am so grateful that I can always count on you - whatever the need of the moment!  Jim, thank you for offering such terrific insights, guidance, and support throughout the call!  I am hopeful that this learning expedition will be a valuable first step in progressing with our mission driven goal of expanding beyond the workplace and into schools!  Great team effort and thank you, from both Kevin and me!\n\n197#Whirlpool Business Review|Thanks to you all for the time and effort that went into holding a successful business review with Whirlpool this week (and Cam/Lauren, thanks in advance for the work you will be doing in the follow up meeting next week!) There was quite a deal of preparation that went into this meeting and very clear guidance from the customer in terms of their content expectations. You all did an amazing job delivering exactly what the customer wanted to see. Whirlpool was engaged, asked great questions and is very enthusiastic about the relaunch planned for Q2. With some new blood on the Whirlpool team we have an opportunity to make a difference in how they design their future (glocal!?!) program and I look forward to seeing where these conversations lead! Thank you all for your incredible team work.\n\n198#Happy Checkpoint Day!!!|Congratulations!!! Team, I must commend you for getting IBM launched. Each of you brought your all and then some to get this completed. From the countless hours testing configurations, translations, emails, eligibility, handling production issues, and not to mention running numerous data loads. The Checkpoint program will be a success for IBM not just because of all the great Conversations functionalities set up for them, but because of the amount of love and dedication put behind it. After many months of careful planning and execution, HAPPY LAUNCH DAY!!!\n\n199#5,4,3,2,1 - IBM Launch Last Minute Magic|It’s Saturday morning and just like any great NASA launch the behind the scenes last minute is what really makes the magic happen!  Selling this potential direction changing deal was just the beginning and each of you has done amazing last minute work on IBM!  Most of never understand all the effort but we all appreciate you amazing HUMANS for all the extra effort!  Cant wait to hear how much their employees love the new way to Talk!  And to listen!!!  Thanks for urgently giving up your weekend!\n\n200#Biggest Fan|Cam, if the customer development marketing team had a fan club (that would be hysterical), you would be our biggest fan, with the foam finger and all! Joking aside, you have been an stunning partner to our team, from day 1. I recall chatting in Dubai conference room with you and Sarah, rattling off all the crazy things I thought we should be focused on. You are always so energized, positive, willing to help and constantly looking for ways to do right by our customers and the teams that support them. Thanks for being such a terrific teammate! I cannot overstate what a pleasure it is to work and collaborate with you!\n\n201#IBM Successful Data Load!|Thanks to all of you and congratulations on the first successful load of IBM's data into production as the next step towards launch next week.  This is one of our largest customer files and involved some creative analysis, problem solving, code changes and data sleuthing!  The Dunkin Donuts man would say \"it's time to make the donuts\" at all hours of the day and night.  Just like him, you have worked TOGETHER to overcome misplaced quotes, ill-formed files, \"orphaned\" employees and high volumes to get us to that next step along the journey.  This has taken literally dozens of attempts and we now we have success. Thanks to you all for always being positive and creative.  On to our next milestone with IBM.\n\n202#IBM is live in production!|Today is the day we have all been waiting for! After roughly THREE months of testing data files for IBM with 350,000+ records coming from multiple sources, we successfully loaded IBM's first production data file! This is no small effort with every file taking hours to load...this team remained focused day after day, identifying and troubleshooting errors, coordinating fixes with the IBM team, brainstorming on creative solutions, and monitoring data loads day and night. Having successful data in production is quite simply THE most important step in getting IBM launched. Thank you to each of you for all your determination and hard work. You are each part of bringing this extraordinary client to life for Workhuman and giving 350,000 employees and new and better way to have a voice in their career journey. And a very special shout-out to you, Shawn, for leading this process in it's entirety. We needed your expertise on this project and you delivered! Congratulations to each of you and take a moment to celebrate this big moment!\n\n203#Life Events ABM Partner In Crime|Cam, I can't thank you enough for your partnership the past several weeks with Life Events upsell campaigns. You've been instrumental in considering each opportunity individually in unique ways, asked thoughtful questions about ABM and have been an overall incredible team player. Just reflecting back on the last several weeks, you've pulled & analyzed data, dug into pricing, created pitch decks, successfully rolled this out to the team - and even found time to record a video explaining stats for our customers! I have no doubt that these upsell tactics will come to fruition, thanks to you and the value you are helping Workhuman articulate. Thanks again and I look forward to partnering with you more and more in the future!!\n\n204#Thank You|Cam, Thank You for your prompt & professional handling of WH Enhancements DEI & Reporting Privilege's queries received by one of our Clients today, after a quick conversation via phone we agreed to utilize an already existing opportunity to extend usage of Life Event to be combined with new related queries, perfect approach,  Once again Thanks, You Rock!\n\n205#Entering the Home Stretch|Erin, Patrick and Cam, you've been running this race with the IBM launch for months now.  As we predicted, IBM has brought many new requirements, interesting challenges and people to their launch of Conversations.  To date, the project has continued to work so smoothly that the customer has said \"I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop\", but it never has.  This success to date is because the three of you have created and executed a plan that's gotten us into UAT with our eyes now on a Feb 1 launch.   Through countless requirements meetings, status updates and discussions, you've kept IBM engaged and happy.  Thanks for all this work as we enter the Home Stretch towards our launch.  Thank you!\n\n206#Cisco Workday Integration is Live!|A huge thanks to all of you involved in getting Cisco up and running on Workday! Clearly this was a monstrous team effort with hours upon hours of time put in by all of you (and I'm sure there were even more people involved behind the scenes!), whether it was working directly with the customer, configuration, testing, or the intense battle to get spend management up and running. While some parts were quite bumpy indeed, at the end of the day the customer launched successfully and is extremely happy. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n207#Making the IBM Conversations plan come together|To quote The A Team's Col. John 'Hannibal' Smith: \"I love it when a plan comes together.\" I have been extremely fortunate to work closely with each of you on the IBM Conversations launch project these past few months. Erin & Cam, this is the first time I've really been able to collaborate with you - and to say I'm in awe would be an understatement. You've displayed top-notch strategic planning, project management and technical expertise on a daily basis. Oh, and you're excellent presenters and client relationship builders to boot. You've inspired me to match your level, and are setting me up to be successful long-term with IBM. Shawn, Kel & Noah - we simply would not be as successful as we've been with the project without your dedication to quality program configuration and troubleshooting. Your work ensured a smooth UAT process, and the proof is in the praise we received directly from IBM: \"This was the most organized program UAT we've ever been a part of.\" The work is by no means done, but know the great work will continue with each of you on the team.\n\n208#Life Events PEPM Prep!|Awesome work over the last week building out the Life Events PEPM GTM plans. This team did a wonderful job collaborating on strategy, talking through gotchas and working together quickly to develop a strong plan;  all culminating in a terrific discussion with the customer facing teams this week! Appreciate the strong teamwork and love that we created a model to leverage in the future. Amazing partnership, team!\n\n209#Celebrations Go-to-Market Go-Tos|I could not let this year wrap without saying a heartfelt thank you for the incredible energy and efforts you have put into the Life Events and Community Celebrations launches this year. You 3 have been my \"go-tos\" for everything customer facing...navigating customer targeting plans, helping to craft compelling stories, delivering demos together, continuously finding new ways to communicate the value, navigating pricing discussions, and so much more. Every challenge you've met with your full commitment and excitement for this product suite. Each phone call was never enough time given the sparks of creativity, insight and enthusiasm for the potential. I loved getting to know the 3 of you more personally and am so, so grateful we've had the opportunity to collaborate.\n\n210#Boldly going where no one has gone before|Thank you for your Enterprising collaboration on our IBM engagement plan. We've never gone anywhere quite like this before, and your bravery and creativity is just what we needed for this voyage! We had a key milestone this past week - sharing with IBM what we believe will drive engagement for them. Your collaborative effort was key to us putting our best foot forward. Thank you!\n\n211#Thanks for your commitment to this journey!|Huge shout out to our esteemed colleagues on the inaugural Experience Task Force team!   Thank you for all of your support, patience, persistence, passion, participation, and continued commitment to the journey we're on together.  We know that the road hasn't always been clear, and perhaps a little bumpy while we've figured out how to navigate, but we've gotten to our first set of priority ideas to tackle for the buyer journey, which is awesome progress.  And choosing ones for the end-user journey is within sight!  You are part of this team because of the perspective you bring to the table while still always having the customer at the center, and we couldn't be more grateful.  This image captures the spirit that this team has - and can't wait to see the fruits and nuts of our labor!  Thank you again for being on this journey and foraging ahead!   (And may you always appreciate our corniness along the way 😉)  Sincerely,  Meghan and Alice\n\n212#Customer Meeting|Cam & Steen,   Thank you for taking time to meet with one of our customers to help them understand the T&C's of their program. You both were extremely helpful, solution focused and Customer focused to ensure we were doing right by the customer.   The customer went away with a renewed appetite to get the most out of the program and we have some clear actions and plans to help them deliver on this.   Appreciate the support and help - Enjoy the award!!\n\n213#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n214#Amazing Work on IBM Conversations Project|Team -  I wanted to take a moment and reach out to thank you all for the amazing and detailed work that has been done on the IBM Conversations project to date!  Even though we have a long way to go the client has already reached out and stated that this is the best project team and most smoothly run project by a vendor they have experienced in their time @ IBM!  What amazing praise from Simone!  Being on the semi-weekly calls and hearing the client enthusiasm as well as the Workhuman team knowledge and joy means that even though many of you are spending dozens of hours on this per week it will be worth it when we have an ecstatic client once the platform goes live!  Keep up the great work team!  So well done to this point!\n\n215#Internal Community Celebrations launch!|To the Kool Gang who helped shape the vision of how we'd use Community Celebrations here at Workhuman, THANK YOU! Starting with ourselves as the earliest of early adopters means a lot of thoughtful decision making on everything from how our reasons and configuration will work to how we can communicate and support our humans to embrace this new offering most effectively. You embraced the opportunity to learn as we go and then you rolled up your sleeves. You configured, you provided insightful product feedback, you came up with great communications, and most importantly, you demonstrated terrific excitement, flexibility, and support for this new product launch. Thank you for being such a delight to work with on this exciting new milestone for the company!\n\n216#Picking Up What They Put Down|Cam, I'm watching the recording of one of IBM's design session and I'm really impressed by the way that you take the information the IBM team provides, digest it, and send it back to them in a meaningful and strategic configuration option. You did this a few times. What we have consistently heard from them is the need to \"slim down\" options and ensure \"behavior change\". In talking about their Feedback and Goal types, you reminded them of this need and had them choose 2 options. When talking about nudges, you reminded the team of the purpose of nudges - the behavior changes they are looking for. I'm learning a lot from reviewing these recordings in how to ensure the client feels listened to and that we are meeting their needs!\n\n217#Appreciation for this great team|Thank you all for your expertise in leading an important conversation with the OTIS program team.  We have been working with their team over the past few months on some open program questions, culminating in a call with their program leaders this week.  This involved a number of internal discussions as we've been looking at their program activity and how we can continue to lift up their recognition program.  Each of you were so helpful participating in the conversation as we are working to expand our relationship with the customer.  Thank you for your thoughtful expertise in navigating a few different unique topics in the client conversation, as well as working through some specific follow ups from the discussion.   It was a true team effort in showcasing to the client the power and expertise we can continue to bring as their recognition partner.   I thought this picture was a true testament in how our customers are at the heart of all that we do and you all clearly showed that.\n\n218#A moment of surprise & delight for Sam!|Erin, Cam and Yvonne, thank you all so much for the thoughtful gift that came through the post this morning for Sam! When he burst into the room the other day asking me for a lollipop during our IBM steering group call, little did he (or I) expect a big bag of them to arrive at his door a couple of days later. To say he was thrilled is an understatement. I am worried though, that this has set a dangerous precedent of him just shouting his demands at the people on daddy's zoom calls and expecting the postman to follow through 😆 Really thoughtful of you all though, thank again!\n\n219#The A-Team delivers for Cardinal Health|Team- when we found out, on short notice, that we needed to put together and deliver a formal RFP presentation to Cardinal Health, it quickly became apparent that we needed our best and brightest on this critical call. From strategy sessions and walkthroughs to the meeting itself, each of you delivered in a huge way. Jay, you provided a smooth and confident opening. Traci, your infectious energy and deep knowledge of Cardinal's history brought home our partnership with the customer. Cam, your targeted and detailed demo brought home key aspects of our platform. And Chris, you came over the top and brought the executive gravitas and passion that tied it all together. Through two plus hours you all crushed this presentation, and it was obvious that the customer was impressed. A huge thanks to all of you for this epic \"A-Team\" effort!\n\n220#Partner in Crime|Cam- this award is long overdue! I have to say, the team and myself would be lost without your constant and ongoing support! You have played such an instrumental role on so many customers, whether it be for contract negotiations, contract questions, new opportunities, saving businesses...the list goes on and on! You have been such an amazing partner, and I truly don't know what I would do without you. We have such a great rhythm going, and I look forward to partnering on many many more projects with you in the future! Thanks again for all that you do!!\n\n221#Overdue gratitude|Cam, this recognition is sorely overdue. It has been a sincere pleasure working alongside you these past few months on countless new initiatives.  Life Events adoption. Subscription mix renewals. Center of Excellence. You grasp concepts right away and always, always make progress. No excuses. You find ways around, over or through obstacles and always bring positivity and creativity to every discussion. Thanks for all the great work and for keeping it fun along the way.  I'm grateful to be on the journey with you.  Well done!\n\n222#We will have Customer Success opportunities...|Team, I wanted to thank you for all your time, insights and iteration to get us to a point where we can start to outline pipeline management in Customer Success. As they say, our ideas together are better then anyone’s individual thoughts and this is just another great example of this mindset in action. You all had ideas which where built upon to build a foundation of the “three stages” we will be able to capture in SFDC and broadcast automatically via emailed dashboards. Thank you for all your ideas and open minds to bring us to such a place. Together we can and will change the world one employees, one program and one opportunity at a time!!!\n\n223#Day in the Life!|Cam, thanks so much for taking time out of your day to join the customer marketing team call. With some new folks on the team, hearing about a 'day in the life' of some of our stakeholders is so helpful. Appreciate you sharing your background, focus areas and taking time for questions! Thanks for being such an awesome teammate!\n\n224#Successful start to our DentaQuest|Cam & Erica, we made an excellent team over these past few weeks as we prepared for DentaQuest's first ever program review - and it resulted in a powerful, effective meeting with the client. We had the rare opportunity of being able to meet with their CHRO and other key executive stakeholders to learn more about their initiatives and perception of their program, educate them on what we're seeing in terms of the impact of recognition and share insights around how program is performing. Cam, you did an amazing job of compellingly detailing the Workhuman story, outlining our various solutions and promoting all of the insightful analyses we're capable of conducting. Erica, you piqued their interest with your analysis around the clear turnover reduction they've enjoyed via the program, and how employees with the most diverse mix of giving and receiving across colleagues and managers resulted in an increased likelihood of DentaQuest retaining them. Thank you both again for all your hard work. With your help, we delivered an effective message they they were clearly engaged in, and I'm excited by the potential of growing this relationship with them further!\n\n225#Cut the cord!|Thanks Rich, Lauren, Cam and Hari for your all the quality work, help and assistance each of you provided to get us to this momentous day.  We received official notice today that Lam Research officially shut down their old program as part of the schedule to turn on their new and improved Above and Beyond program in June.  Cam and Hari you were pivotal in getting us into contract and Rich and Lauren you took the ball and seamlessly put our client on the path to delivering their vision for their 10,000 employees around the globe.  Thanks so much for all of your efforts.\n\n226#Hey, how are you with v-lookups?!|Ha. Cam. I think you might actually block me on Slack! Thank you for ALWAYS being there to offer a helping hand, no matter what RANDO question I might have for you. Today's feature at 7:30 AM, v-lookups! I sincerely appreciate your help, ability to talk through challenges and always come with a solution mindset, you are the best teammate, thank you!!!\n\n227#Quick reaction and support|Team: Thank you SO much for all your help in getting things sorted yesterday and today with the demo site. Brian: you quickly reacted to a ticket when I needed some site clean up of an image which I was unable to rectify myself. Dan, you helped make some quick configuration changes to support my talk track and helped loading enough content to show off the richness of the experience. Cam and Erin, you both jumped in with advice from when you did it and also were happy to lend a last minute hand in adding comments and content.   These things take a village...and I'm happy to be surrounded with such great coworkers and support!!\n\n228#Creating A Human Moments That Matters!|Erin and Cam, I want to recognize you both for creating a wonderful human moment that matters for your colleagues across the company!  Seeing this come to life made my heart sing!  Your inspiration, care and passion for this project is fantastic to witness!  Thank you for taking the time to create this magical human moment, from thinking about how to make the connection for team members who are not customer facing as to the impact and value of their work.  From sharing information about our customers impact during Covid 19 to heartfelt messages from their employees using our platform! To recognizing the cross-company contribution to life events and conversations and the amazing feedback we are seeing from customers embracing this across their companies!  You creatively brought your vision to life and the end result was a powerful, authentic and very thoughtful display of your care and compassion!  Thank you – you are an inspiration!\n\n229#Great Partnership!|Cam, thank you for all the hard work you do in helping us move along strategic priorities with our customers. Specifically, with Momentive, you have had to get involved in the not so fun conversations but you do it grace and ensure you have all your ducks in a row before getting on any calls. I am excited to continue working together to help our customers thrive, hopefully with more fun priorities going forward :)\n\n230#World class walk through|Cam - so impressed with your professional, personable, and skillful walkthrough of our ever evolving WHE free products deck with Eric just now. Big moment for the company and brand - pumped to have such a talented leader in you bringing this message to customers. With gratitude, -C\n\n231#Sincere & Authentic Participation!|Thank you all for collaborating on the Thank You video for healthcare workers around the globe!  Each of you took the time to record yourselves over the weekend to provide us with enough material to create the video.  The response from those asked to submit videos was so positive that we could not fit all of your wonderful selves into the video, but we would like you to know that we appreciate each and every one of you who stepped up and delivered!  Thank you!  I appreciate you!  The response thus far has been wonderful, and it could not have happened without you!  Well done!  Thank you!\n\n232#Excellent Support|Cam, I reached out to you last Friday for help with some positioning for the broader team regarding changes we were making. Little did I realize that you would turn my request around in a matter of hours! Incredible support and really appreciated. I am glad Chris suggested I reach out to you!! Cheers\n\n233#It was a moment!|A huge and sincere T H A N K Y O U to this long list of amazing humans. It seems like an eternity but just a short few weeks ago at the Executive off-site down in Florida, Eric and his team were all seated for a session. Each person was handed a sealed envelope with their name on it. Inside were the private letters each of you wrote. Some vulnerable, some filled with humor but all filled with how that person made you feel. It was a moment! Silence, smiles and even tears. It's not every day you get the chance to silence an entire Executive Team and remind them of how much they also matter and how they have influenced your day, week - or career. Thank you for being at the heart of what made this moment come to life.You all are amazing!  -Rebecca & Alice\n\n234#Life Events for All|In less than 24 hours, this team of A-players was able to pull together all the tools we would need to offer Life Events to all customers.  Configuration guidance.  Check.  Proposed design. Check. All the supporting communications our internal program managers would need. Check. A pre-configured template in sandbox. Check. 3 amazing colleagues able to make magic happen in an instant...priceless.  Thank you for approaching this with an action bias, urgency and a commitment to excellence.  Amazing work!\n\n235#Warm Welcome!|Cam and Sarah, thank you both for such a warm reception into the customer success family! I cannot tell you how much it means to me to have a support system willing to answer questions, help collaborate and are as excited as I am to embark on this journey. The last few weeks have been drinking from the fire hose to learn the team, the opportunities and how I can dig in to make some progress, but not get stuck in perfection mode! Really appreciate the support and can't wait for the success to come. Cheers to you both.\n\n236#Thank you!|Cam, it's been great to work with you on multiple clients lately but I have to call out today's meeting with AIB. You delivered a fantastic presentation to them on our D&I analytics capabilities. While at the moment they are in a tough space and under pressure to make cuts across the business, I feel like what was delivered really showed them and got them thinking about the value their program and WH can bring in this space. I could tell the team were really engaged with what was presented. I love how you already got them looking forward to Eric's keynote at Workhuman live Dublin. Let's get a team of them there! Great work, thank you!\n\n237#Rockstar Persona Actors|Team-Thank you for playing an integral part of the Customer Success New Hire Certification process. I have updated the process in the Demo Certification and you all embraced each persona you were given with full integrity! Each of your perspectives with customers has allowed us to develop a comprehensive and in depth certification process. Playing the persona you were given, each of you were thoughtful in asking questions you have heard from customers in the past to prepare Melissa with what the world will look like soon. I appreciate that you have given myself and Melissa thoughtful feedback to consider injecting in the future. Cheers!\n\n238#Shoutout to all my Saucy Aunts|Thank you all so much for bringing great energy, enthusiasm, and attention to the kickoff with Influitive! This was a true cross-functional effort with representation from CX, CS, Strategy and Consulting, Marketing, Sales Operations, and Design – an awesome demonstration of the power of collaboration. As we heard, even our Influitive consultant was impressed with how much involvement we had. You all brought unique perspectives on how we can engage with and deliver value to our customers through this community platform. I’m still riding the wave of excitement coming from our kickoff and am so excited to engage with each of you further in executing on the strategy we developed together. And not only were we productive, but we got to have some fun in there too ?. I’m so grateful to work alongside each and every one of you. Looking forward to the amazing things to come!\n\n239#Respectful Candor|Team, I wanted to thank you all for your open minds and hearts as we shared so many personal stories and moments that shaped us all...the good, the bad and the lessons learned. We laughed...I personal got a little choked-up at times but it was all in the interest of building trust among colleagues/friends. I truly believe our session on Tuesday has opened our two way doors to “respectful” candor in alignment with our  Workhuman values. We may disagree from time to time; however we have the tools and language to find the middle ground and move forward.  Here’s to open candid tough and honest conversations in pursuit of changing the world together!\n\n240#Elevating Customer Success|Cam-Thank you for sharing your vision and goals with me today from a strategy perspective. I am impressed with the innovative plan on some of your key projects which will be so impactful and fresh for the Customer. We both have overlapping priorities and strategies along with different view points into each one. Bouncing ideas and initiatives off of each other is going to elevate the strategy and execution one priority at a time. I am excited to be partnering with you to push these initiatives forward as we deliver the best in class insights and knowledge to the Customer Success team and Customers!\n\n241#Ignite Solutions|Thanks to all of you for being so willing to serve as facilitators for the Ignite Solutions activity!  We were trying something a bit different and were not completely sure how it would work out.  However, you were all willing to step-in and give it a try with energy and enthusiasm.  Your level of participation and preparedness for this activity was so impressive!  You delivered a great experience for our humans and provided some valuable feedback on how we can offer these types of collaborative activities in the future.\n\n242#Three heads are better than One!|Danielle and Cam- I cannot thank you enough for taking time out of your busy days to lend your expert eyes to help me solve for some tricky scenarios with Endurance approval and eligibility rules.  Without your help, I would still look like this cartoon (ok... to be honest, I would look worse).  I am so happy to be part of a team where our leadership is ready and willing to roll up their sleeves and work through an issue when needed.  Thank you!!\n\n243#Yes and has come to life...|Team, I know it is difficult to take two mornings out of your week while you have Customer calls, emails and launches happening to attend a knowledge share workshop on some of our trickiest topics.  I must say it was impressive to see everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge building upon each other thoughts.  The collaboration among such a diverse group of people and roles  was simply amazing to be a part of and witness among a group of 40 strong.  If you were wondering what Respect for All looks like...you were just a part of it and each of you made it happen!  I would be remiss without calling out your contribution to moments that matter by agreeing to be present in our workshop and any other meeting moving forward.  We all know how it feels when someone/s is multi-tasks and I was so pleased to see laptops closed and true focus and attention on the subject and task at hand.  Thank you all for a great two days, I cannot wait to see what this Team does next.\n\n244#AIM'ing High|It is always a pleasure when we step into a room with a singular purpose and see such diversity of thought and collaboration with the sole purpose of propelling our people, our organization and our company mission forward.  That was quite evident during our brainstorming session last week to determine what our Q1 AIM's should be and how to best drive cross departmental collaboration.  We all had ideas and a voice to ensure we came to the table with the best possible solution.  Well done to all...and a special call out to Erin for taking the lead to ensure our thoughts were captured real time; that made all the difference to highlight the gaps so we could close them.\n\n245#Keeping the Water(s) flowing|Cam- Great work on the Waters RFP and the finalist pitch. I could tell that you worked hard on the RFP document and the presentation, and did thorough research about the customer, which was evident to all of us. It was great to see you in action in person with this customer, and to learn from you throughout the process. As mentioned before, you are truly impressive with customers and remain poised and confident the whole time, which instills confidence in customers. Hoping that we hear good news back soon!\n\n246#Progress not perfections...|Team, I wanted to call out the time and attention each of you had in support of rebuilding a resource planning tool for 2020 and beyond.  We started with a lot of questions about what this foreign spreadsheet was...to having a descent understanding of what it was saying...to rebuilding a new one.  We battled tested our assumptions, changed a few calculations and learned a whole lot about where we are and where we need to go.  Thank you for keeping an open mind and providing your knowledge and perspective to put our best foot forward.  We are all better off using our collective thoughts verses one individual.  We have just begin this journey; however I am excited for what's to come.\n\n247#All together we succeed|Everyone, I wanted to recognise each of you for all you do when helping out the production support team. It has been another busy year, I for one cannot thank you all enough for everything you do to help out team out. There are countless small things that you all do that really make working here easier. There are countless things that are greatly appreciated and for those things I want to recognise you all. I still find it amazing how despite working across an ocean we have such a great comradery, friendship and can share laughs. I find it phenomenal just how much work we get through and the things we can achieve working side by side are incredible. No matter what we get the support we need and I know that together our team can give our customers a truly world class experience. Thank you all for being you and the teamwork you have displayed over the year. You are all the best :D\n\n248#SUPER impressed|Cam- Prior to your new role, I didn't have a lot of interaction with you work wise. I knew that you blew the sales certification away, but didn't have the opportunity to see you in action first hand. Now that I have had the experience with working with you on RFPs, R & R additions, YOS additions, and renewals, I can't say enough how impressed I am with you and the way you interact both internally and with our customers.  You are able to very clearly articulate our product offerings and pricing structure and I can tell you spend the extra time to learn about the customer before hopping on a call. Great job, and can't wait to continue working with you in this capacity!\n\n249##Tweeps|We have been reviewing, practicing, and preparing for today's meeting at Twitter. We brought together a team reflective of their needs/wants along with what great could look like. Thank you Bobby for TEEING UP this opportunity to get us to a place where Twitter are considering our solutions for their Tweeps. Ken, your thoughtful preparation and meeting focus allowed us to not only up-level the conversation from the tactical to the strategic. I LOVED when you stopped the conversation around cash and simply said \"there is a much better way backed by data.\" Hari, your thoughtful overview and ability to respond to their deep dive questions proved CRITICAL in aligning the Workhuman Cloud to their demands/needs. Shiamalee, thank you for realigning your travels and schedule to be a part of this meeting. Your thoughtful ideas around alining outcomes to their I & D needs was fantastic. When you told your first person story about why recognition matters, and incentivizes you to tell your fellow female thought leaders to join Workhuman was AMAZING. It was authentic and moving. I can't wait to have you join more meetings in the future. Cam, your THOUGHTFUL support was felt in today's meeting and put Shiamalee and the entire team in a place to be selected as a partner for Twitter. We have work to do, but we are off to a strong strong start! Thank you #Tweeps!\n\n250#Determined leadership|I wanted to recognize each of you for all your hard work this week collaborating, brainstorming, and determining creative solutions to better service our high volume accounts and make life better in Customer Success. This is not easy, but everyone is pitching in, contributing, and staying positive. I am so thankful and proud to work with this amazing team!\n\n251#Two values in one / Teamwork & Urgency|Thanks for joining us on call at short notice Cam exhibiting both our Respect for Teamwork and Agency all in one. I know you had some family health issues to attend to last week, but you still managed to fix our client ATS time today to walk them through what they needed to enhance their program. Potentially, this is revenue for workhuman in waiting, thanks to you.\n\n252#A call to the bullpen|Cam, thanks so much for your help in pulling together some outcome maps for an internal exercise we're working on.  This was a big relief and help for the larger customer success team.  I appreciate you taking time out of all that you're working on to help pull these together.  This will be a big help and win as we're working to position the Workhuman Certified Enterprise project with some of our larger accounts.  You're a great teammate and always appreciate all you do to help others.\n\n253#Strategy & Alignment|Cam & Erin - What would I do without you two?! I look forward to our discussions on strategy and alignment every week. Cam - I don't know anyone who can explain our business model better than you! You have a natural curiosity for strategy and positioning and I'm confident you will grow our customer base and loyalty in no time. Erin - Your passion and enthusiasm for our Product and Customer Experience is unparalleled, and several leaders have shared how much they value your contributions and enjoy working with you. Thank you both for working together and building the Innovation Adoption LifeCycle that helps us identify the different segments are Customer are in, and the potential strategies we can apply to increase usage and adoption. The Maturity Scoring Model you created helped you to uncover the key elements of success for our Top 10 Customers, and weren't there a few surprises?!?! I look forward to seeing how you leverage your learnings to increase user adoption and strategically grow our Customer base and loyalty. Thank you for all your efforts over the past couple of months -you should be really proud!\n\n254#time to zoom in|Thank you all for the recent contributions you made in implementing zoom! Lauren thank you for coming with the recommendation and contact for Zoom, none of this would have happened without you. Jonathan, Dante for your support and direction on the project, Christie for you tireless drive on the contract negotiations and getting this completed in time,  Steve for approving the Spend, Eoin & Jamesley for the support in getting the trial up and running, supporting the users during this time and most importantly everyone else who participated in the Zoom trial and gave the Honest and positive feedback on Zoom which made everyone else’s efforts worthwhile.  This was a true team effort and we are now positioned with a best in class conferencing system going forward to help and support the company’s efforts to reach its goals! Thank you all for your patience while this process was closed out.\n\n255#Creativity and focus on Cognizant|Cam, I have to call out the hard work you've been putting into Cognizant and their launch.  While I have only recently been involved with this client it's already clear you've been going above and beyond for this customer.  The latest example was needing to pull together a custom demo site together for their leadership team in a relatively quick amount of time.  I know this involved a lot of work on your end and ate up a chunk of your day to pull this all together.  Not only that but then you delivered it back to the program team in a straightforward manner, which was well received by the client.  This has certainly been a unique client who pushes the limits in a number of ways, but you always come across with a calm and focused demeanor in all your interactions.  Thanks for leading this project with such professionalism and client focus.\n\n256#Customer Success Offsite 2019!!|What an amazing and talented team we have in Customer Success! I am so proud of everything we've accomplished as a team over the past quarter. Thank you Liz, Laura, and Michelle for your creativity and flawless execution of the event from beginning to end - you made the event FUN with odd activities and that was exactly what we needed! Robin and Sharon, thank you for your continued support - your workshop helped the team immensely on how to effectively manage change and it was very well received. Eric - the team was so inspired by your session that they kicked off the Gratitude Movement beyond the Workplace at Foxwoods itself (see video)! And thank you to the entire Customer Success team for your active engagement and contribution throughout the event - this event was special because of YOU, and I am so grateful that we are a team!! Thank you, All...\n\n257#Aloft in Alpharetta with McK|Marcy, Josh, and Cam,   McKesson's stock price, following our finalist meeting with them, went aloft!  Coincidence?   Just think how great they'll do when they really start working with us!  You all pulled together for a masterful 90-min finalist meeting and the feedback since has been all positive!  We received a direct thank you from their SVP HR, commenting on how well Workhuman showed up for them and the obvious effort we've exhibited getting to know them and their business.  Evidence of how well the meeting went?  They gave us 25% time than allocated and procurement was silenced when our original time was up - they wanted more and are still asking for additional demonstrations.  We've got momentum.  That's no coincidence.  That's the result of your committment to quality, your energy, enthusiasm, and authenticity!  They can tell we're in this to help them with \"what is possible,\" as quoted by their SVP HR.  Let's keep this going!!  Thank you for your awesome teamwork, preparation, travel, and excellence!\n\n258#YOS & COGNIZANT|Guys, just wanted to thank you all for your efforts the past few weeks in helping drive the conversation (once again) with Cognizant on YOS in India. Hopefully not jinxing it but I feel all the work that has been done should allow us to get to the right place with the Customer.. Well done and enjoy the award..\n\n259#The Right Strategy|You have a talent for taking complex launches and seeing what the right strategy is to address the concerns. It’s balancing our business goals, the customers desires and having a passion for doing what’s right. That balance may also mean getting creative to see how to get to the finish line for a critical timeline. You’ve demonstrated all these skills recently for Endurance, Cognizant and Fisher. Your enthusiasm for “let’s do what we have to do then” no matter the challenge is just who you are. Thank you for all you do for our customers and for just being you!\n\n260#Leading by Example|Cam, thanks for being such a great partner to me on Simpson Strong-Tie's YOS launch. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor to shadow my first project. I appreciate that you let me take the reigns but were always there as backup. I know that they are in great hands as I transition off the account.\n\n261#Lam Swat Team|Hari and Cam thank you both for all the time energy and effort you brought to assisting with the preparation for today's Lam Research on-site.  All of your help over that last few week with the discovery, planning, strategy and ultimately delivery of the presentation today put us in a great position to win.  Thanks for all your great work.\n\n262#Keeping CSX On Track|Team, thank you for all of your help conducting CSX's UAT. They ended up being a little more demanding than expected especially in branding aspects, complicated rule changes, and employee privacy. I appreciate all of your patience with the number of tickets opened through the past couple of weeks as they reviewed the site. They are wrapping up now and preparing to sign off on UAT by the end of the week, with their launch day is right around the corner. I wouldn't be able to do this without your help and support!\n\n263#Thanks for the support|Thanks for the on-site support during today's training session. I figured we'd run into some issues with the conference rooms and there's not much I can do when working remotely. I asked for help in advance and you all agreed. One room worked out fine and the other....well....it needed some fine-tuning. Thanks for your patience and problem-solving, we started and ended on time!  Thanks again!\n\n264#Shining at Corteva|Team, thanks for a great kick-off at Corteva this week! It was a true team effort starting with Chris setting us up for success before we even got on site by building a great relationship with the Corteve team, who buys into what we do and how we do it! Sarah, you coordinated all the logistics and kicked off the day, paving the way for a productive discussion, and you positioned yourself up as a trusted partner they can depend on post launch. Cam, I'm thrilled to be working with you again! You have a wonderful way with our customers, sharing your insights and best practices, strategically steering them in the right direction. And Melissa, thank you for joining the team last minute as you were integral to our brand brainstorming exercise given the large number of folks who were joining remotely from around the globe! I'm looking forward to working with you all in the weeks to come as we help Corteva \"Grow What Matters.\"\n\n265#To a true client partner!|Cam – I wanted to take a minute to recognize all the work you’ve done for and with the Fisher team.   Despite initially wanting a quick launch, they have had a tough time making firm decisions and have, on occasion, over thought some pieces of their program and I really admire your approach and patience with them.  Whether it’s setting up additional calls with the program manager to talk through things in advance of our weekly project calls, having a really patient and low pressure approach to sharing our best practices, or just being that extra support for the program manager as she tries to push things internally, you have definitely put in many hours with this customer and it hasn’t gone unnoticed.  I personally learn a lot from you on the weekly calls and appreciate your partnership on one of my first customers!  Thanks!\n\n266#Where can I help?!|Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!! You all stepped up and was willing to help whenever we needed an extra staff member to hold a sign for seating, registration, room monitors, and many many more!!! I could just be passing by you heading across the huge space to cover another area and you would immediately follow asking if I needed help anywhere. You were there to support Customers in all other areas during the day and night but always was willing to jump in when we needed you!!! Thank you all so very much for all your support last week!!!  Your the best!\n\n267#Launching into 2019|Thank you team, for a fantastic offsite as we had a 2018 year in review and then a look towards 2019. You all brought your whole selves on self reflection, process improvements, customer relationships and management and personal growth. I’m excited for the year ahead and the strides we’ll make as a team to be the best yet! I love being a part of this team.  And a special thanks to Shawn...for your help in the logistics, your design insight and my co-chef!\n\n"
"268#Seeing Green in a Good Way!|When Citizens asked us to help them \"Show Some Love\" and come onsite to assist with and film their launch activities on Valentine's Day, this group hustled into action.   Michelle, you and I are co-conspirators in ensuring that Citizens has the best experience in every Workhuman interaction they have with us, down to finding the right shade of green to wear to help staff their launch events. You were everywhere assisting the team, whether it was talking with colleagues at the Credo Awards table and answering the numerous requests coming from Derek. Also, my Fitbit confirms we officially hit 10K steps for the day!  Amanda, James and Matt - you had no hesitation being onsite at 7am at Citizens' request. While the Citizens team was nervous at the prospect of being filmed, you reassured them that they'd be captured in the best light (literally) and they were all put at ease with your mix of professionalism and reassurance. Amanda, you were on top of ensuring that we were capturing the release forms that Citizens required, no matter how many random superusers were tossed our way! James, your interview style helped our subjects relax off the bat and give us those quality sound bites we were looking for. Matt, you were the life as the party as always! Although people tend to treat anyone with a video camera as a pariah at times, you were there capturing all the key moments in an unobtrusive way, and also charming the Citizens team with your comments.  Cam - I also have to acknowledge your efforts and presence in spirit. Every time the project team talked about their partnership with Workhuman on film, they were effusive in their praise of our launch support, and would mention you, Michelle and myself by name.   Ashley, you've been along for the whole Citizens journey. Your work was evident everywhere and helped bring a cohesive look and feel to the Credo Awards event. Thanks for hustling on the launch event handout that helped dress the tables.\n\n269#An LSM, Prod Support and a DBA walk into a room...|A launch team first – Launch Success, Prod Support and DBA all sitting in the same room together! Thanks to GFORCE20, we were all brought together for Akamai’s launch day. I can’t thank you enough Cam, Paul, Stephen and Enda for putting the customer first and our community celebration activities aside to ensure we had the right support all day. This support level puts the customer at ease, and they even shared that repeatedly on the day long war room session with Cam, as they saw you in the background. We had a small but into the evening nagging item that was successfully resolved due to your dedication, Cam and Paul. You were huddled up in the hotel room pin pointing the issue until you found the needle in the haystack. The end result was a happy client. Akamai had a great launch and each of your efforts contributed to that success!\n\n270#Kicking-off with Endurance|Team, What a day we had with Endurance International yesterday at their Kick-off design lab.  I thought the team was prepared, asked great questions and was very interactive through the entire day.  The interaction from the Endurance team was right on par with ours resulting in a quality day!  Cam and Maggie, you led the day and the agenda and finished right on time.  Kara, Amy, Shawn and Dave your thoughtful questions and answers enhanced the quality of this meeting.  Overall, I am very impressed.  I think Endurance is going to be a great strategic partner with Globoforce.  It gets Tom Aurelio back in the fold with us as well! Cheers!\n\n271#CSX Launch Excellence|Cam, I just wanted to call out the great work you're doing on the CSX launch. We're only a few weeks in, but from the minute this was handed off, your main focus has been making sure the their program is set up for success.  Right away, you identified a potential issue for offline access which would have made for a bad experience for over 90% of their population. Rather than glossing over this and simply hoping for the best, you quickly gathered information, reached out to the appropriate internal teams to investigate, and got the ball rolling on a solution. All of this, along with a plan B,C, and D if needed, before going onsite for the design lab. Although there's still work to be done (and a few more hurdles to jump), it's real comforting to know that you're always thinking about the long term success of the program.  I really appreciate all the efforts you've put in so far and am looking forward to their successful launch... (after you figure out all of those other hurdles of course).\n\n272#Bringing 21,000 Miles of New Connections to CSX!|Let's all jump up from our chairs and scream and shout ... \"CAM's OUR MAN ... if Cam can't do it ...      no body CAN.\" I'm truly doing this in my office right now.  Why? Because it's so well deserved and earned. Your enthusiasm, passion, dedication and 'can do' attitude has spans miles already for CSX's upcoming April launch.  A few 'opportunities' with their offline workforce - no dedicated manager in the data file nor company issued email addresses to all  - presented themselves at the end of last year. You dug right in, tracked down others internally to strategize on potential solutions, explored and developed options all while sticking to the fact you'd do everything in your power to ensure a GREAT user experience for ALL when the program launches.  Your due diligence, extra efforts, 'make it happen' spirit really shined through.  And not only did your prep WOW me, your presence, product knowledge, credible guidance, enthusiasm for what we do and superb presentation style was truly WOW! WOW! at the Design Lab.  I haven't had the privilege to see you in action before and exactly what I envisioned was delivered! You have the ability to instantly connect with audiences, use great body language and eye contact to convey energy and confidence, pause to emphasize key points, articulate clearly and smoothly, don't mince your words, interject humor when appropriate, summarize questions for clarity before responding and engage and inspire everyone from the most senior leaders in the room to the payroll admin who crossed her arms most of the meeting! A natural talent, you are!! CSX is in such great hands with you. CSX is vital to our nation, makes tomorrow happen for companies across the globe. And our own, 'Cam the Man' is vital to unlocking the potential, purpose and passion for the 30,000+ CSX employees who will soon spring out of bed to do their lives best work because they feel valued, appreciated and recognized for their contributions!! YOU ROCK!!\n\n273#Steward of giving good feedback in conversations|Cam, I want to publicly share my appreciation of our work together on CSX to date and how you are a steward of giving feedback. You and I have worked on many accounts together, beginning way back with General Cable. You are a great teammate. But this week, you did something that I want to share with others as an example of what an even better teamwork can look like. I asked you for feedback after the CSX design lab. When requesting feedback, I followed the instructions I had given Dell employees in their training videos--I stated what I thought went well and stated an area where I thought I could improve. This request was designed to make you more comfortable when giving me feedback. I then prompted you to give me something I could \"continue\" and something I could \"consider\". And this is where I am grateful for your teamwork this week. You responded within 24 hours, you gave me thoughtful feedback on what I did well AND something I could consider. And when giving the feedback on where I could improve, you did it in a kind, thoughtful way. Thank you for giving me something I can work on professionally that can help my career development. It was a perfect example of how to give feedback and how powerful it can be in the hands of the receiver.\n\n274#Yoeman’s work on Citizens Launch|Well done team in getting Citizen’s Bank launched on January 7.  Derek has done nothing but rave about the amazing team that Globoforce provided to Citizens Bank that allowed them to have a wonderful launch experience.! Despite a database challenge last week we have seen great activity and feedback on the client site. The team made the client look great and I am sure will continue to do so. Well done launch team!!\n\n275#Calm, Cool and Collected|I wanted to give you a shout out for how calm, cool and collected you were with the few issues encountered with Citizen’s, days leading up to their launch. You took control of the situation, balanced gathering the details while keeping calm in the face of the customer…in both situations. You were in constant contact with the internal teams ensuring you had relevant details to share with the client during regular updates. Communicating at a regular cadence in this pressure cooker time, was key and you nailed it. The relationship you have built thus far was a significant contributing factor for the customer’s controlled reaction to the issue. He was confident you were on the issue on his behalf and you proved him right. Great job on your leadership and congrats on the first launch of 2019!\n\n276#Unisys effort|Cam,  thank you very much for your assistance with the Unisys call. Not only did you invest some time up front, you took the time for extra preparation and slides to hit on the key elements of the conversation.  You made the prospect/customer experience a great one and simplified the hurdles for them.  We are now moving towards closure!!! Thank you so much for your time and effort on this and all you do.\n\n277#We are all Citizens|Cam -  I keep hearing from Derek how much he loves working with you and anytime I try to schedule anything with him (like dinner) he asks if you are going to be attending as well.  Man crush maybe?  All joking aside as you put in this great work to get Citizens ready for launch it is wonderful to see how you have built this relationship with Derek.  These guys are going to be great clients and surely spend more annually once we get Derek and his attention to detail in line with the WorkHuman Research Institute!  Well done!\n\n278#Smooth sailing|Hi Cam, just wanted to take a second to thank you for all the hard work you've put into making all the projects we've worked on over the last few months run so smoothly. Through collaborating with you on these multiple projects I've found you very easy going to work with and with a good attitude. With clients sometimes being indecisive at times it's good to know you can keep me up to date and keep the project on the ball. Thanks and I look forward to working with you on plenty of new projects in 2019! Cheers, Clíona\n\n279#Go team!!|Hi everyone. I wanted to take a moment to recognize the fantastic work that you guys have carried out in 2018. This was a very busy year with a lot of big launches - (Dell immediately comes to mind) and I know it was certainly challenging at times! However I feel that due to the strong partnership that exists across our teams, we have delivered excellence consistently for our customers. Speaking for my team, I would like to say that we value all of your hard work and we could not ask for a nicer bunch of people to work hand in hand with. I hope that our partnership continues to grow from strength to strength in 2019 and that our customers continue to benefit from the collective determination shown. Thank you all for a great 2018 and I hope to see you all for a celebratory drink in Dublin in January!  Thanks!\n\n280#Akamai Add-On in the Books!|Team, Thank you for your quality work in helping get the Akamai amendment across the finish line.  Cam, you were side by side with me through the whole process, helping this stay top of mind to Beth and David over at Akamai.  You were consistent and thoughtful in your approach.  Tom, I appreciate your guidance, strategy and positioning to David making it easy for him to communicate internally.  Bill, great job on all the work associated to the customized plaques and shipping logistics to meet their needs.  Chris and Julia, much appreciation for your work on the numbers and amendment documents.  This program is going to be awesome!  A customer that we will be talking about in the near future when they launch in January. Cheers!\n\n281#Launch Sequence initiated- T-Minus 'X' & counting|Hi team,  I received feedback today from my friend and coach at Aaron's.  I was  just chekcing in with her since I know there have been leadership changes and delay delay delay.   The good news is that the program will grow - even before launch and their ELT is recognizing the enormous power the tool has to help with creating the culture where their employees WANT to go the extra mile.  The quote I wanted to share in particular is as follows: \"The implementation/launch experience from the Globoforce team has been fantastic – it’s our side that is challenging but I believe it will be for the good.\"   She had much more glowing comments on the consultative approach, patience, guidance and process.  Well done and Thank you!\n\n282#Month of a Million Questions|Cam; it goes without saying that you're an outstanding LSM - but you're also a fantastic teammate. I couldn't count how often I've leaned over our shared 'water bottle / headset / stapler' desk partition to seek your advice in the past month - our busiest of the year. We've brainstormed, debated, and consulted on countless launch questions - and you never hesitate to contribute your experience while guiding me to thoughtfully reach my own conclusions. Thanks for being a great friend and colleague.\n\n283#Bang that gong!|Thank you to our gong ringers for helping us celebrate all the recent good things happening - Erin, Diarmuid, Mark, Hillary, Cam, Allison, and Kelli! And, thank you to Scott, Roger, and John for sharing your customer stories as part of the ceremony. It's great to hear the behind the scenes details that we don't often know about. Thanks to all of you for making yourself available to participate. Much appreciated.\n\n284#Launch + LinkedIn = SUCCESS|Team, thank you for letting me join your pod today to review LinkedIn best practices and review the what, when, where, why of updating your profile, sharing/liking posts and the importance of helping elevate our recruiting efforts, which in turn elevates our employer brand. For those that attended our LI Office Hours to those \"re-upping\" today - we greatly appreciate your participation and support! With your help, we look forward to spreading the word far-and-wide for your team openings!\n\n285#A1 Team for Golf Outing #4|Fellow team members - just a moment to say thanks to each and every one of you for your parts in making this year's 4th Annual Globoforce golf outing a rousing success - from choosing a wonderful facility in Pine Hills, ensuring wonderful raffle prize items, increasing attendance by 45% over last year, and getting even more folks involved we had a wonderful day as we continue this events annual growth!  Each of you took time out of your crazy schedules to make sure we had a great day!  Well done team!\n\n286#First Class Citizens|Melissa, Ashley, Cam and Michelle,  What started as a simple onsite communications & training workstream meeting with three Citizens colleagues evolved into more than four hours onsite with their executive sponsor and program sponsor joining in on the discussion. We had the rare opportunity to tour their brand-new campus during Credo Week, their largest employee engagement event of the year. This face-to-face meeting went a long way with deepening the relationship with eight critical members of the Citizens project team. Above that, I wanted to thank each of you for the role you played in answering Citizens' questions and reinforcing that special Globoforce blend of partnership and expertise in guiding them along the newest iteration of their recognition journey. Melissa, you were my partner in crime in planning the day, agonizing over how best to broach topics and in ensuring everyone felt supported.  Ashley, you were the consummate pro in describing some features available in the Strategy Center and I saw you confidently answering questions from the key Communication contact. Cam and Michelle, where would I be without your deep knowledge of the platform and thoughtful responses to some of the questions the team posed. I know Citizens has every confidence in a successful launch and I know it will be a smooth transition from Cam to you, Michelle, due to the time you've spent from the beginning establishing a relationship with them. I had every confidence in how well the day would turn out thanks to the four of you!\n\n287#A Different Lens|Cam-I am always impressed with how you handle client calls, however today was proof of how consultative you are. We had 10+ decision makers on the line while you tackled important topics and brought great perspective for the group. The best part was when you addressed each item, you went to the demo site and showed exactly where each piece fit into the puzzle. It provided great clarity and understanding to the team. Great job pushing Aaron's forward with such a large group!\n\n288#Pushing the Limits|As I reflect back on the past few months of Dell's launch, I want to take a moment to thank each of you in helping me grow both personally and professionally. Together, we have pushed the limits of what it means to be a specialist and have continued to evolve what the role means. Each of you have helped me realize my potential by allowing me to take full responsibility of more complex aspects of the project. This has been an amazing experience for me and I learned so much throughout the project that I know we will be able to apply moving forward. I couldn't have done any of it without your support, encouragement, mentorship, and patience!\n\n289#Just Do It!|Team, you rocked it at Nike! From the moment I reached out to draft you to the team, you were all in. All the prep, collaboration, and mindful consideration about each and every point in our agenda was worth it to get immediate feedback from a prospective client that they “felt an instant rapport” and “hit every point”. You were authentic, consultative and helpful, and I could see their confidence building with each minute. Thank you for the hours you put in to make this next step a success, and what (again) a pivotal day in Nike’s history to be on campus: the 30th Anniversary of the Just Do It campaign...only their biggest party of the year! To be invited to celebrate with them after our meeting speaks volumes. Well done team - awesome game day execution!\n\n290#Teamwork makes the Dream a Reality!|Andrea and I want to thank you for all your internal teamwork to helping us show Quicken Loans the power of our client partnerships and the consultative guidance we provide through the life of the journey during their onsite visit to Framingham. They left energized about making their dreams and reality and thanking us for the partnership, saying they were really impressed with the GF Team and the Experience we created for them.  Brenda and Amy - thank you for your leadership in helping Andrea and I identify the best team members to articulate our strong story as it related to Launch, CS and Strategy & Consulting, but equally importantly being thoughtful about the client, their culture the personalities of the QL team.    Joyce and Cam - I joked during one of our prep sessions that you two would become the Designated Heavy Hitters for this type of engagement and you absolutely did your thing with QL.  Both of you have a great sense of empathy for the client journey, a humble approach to showing your subject matter expertise and a welcoming demeanor that gave QL a great feeling that these folks and GF as a team are real people we can roll up our sleeves with and have fun get the job done with.   Joyce your change management and comms background gave them comfort based on their fears in that area, but I also sensed a level of excitement around what's possible when you have a partner with our level of experience, expertise and library of proven content/assets - I could see the wheels spinning in their mind and when you can get the client to be comfortable and excited at the same time - win win!  Cam - the Kalamazoo/Midwestern native connection definitely didn't hurt the cause, but more importantly it was your proven experience guiding clients through this journey, proving you have an ability to push them in the right direction, and knowing you have their back is what I think had one of the QL team members asking after you left \"Will Cam be our guy?\"\n\n291#Hustle|Cam, as Abraham Lincoln once said, \"Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.\"  Your decision to get outside your personal comfort zone in Launch Success and not only train for sales certification as a learning experience but also run the gauntlet of the actual certification meeting was inspiring.  The fact that you also performed admirably under pressure was icing on the cake.  An excellent performance! It takes a special person to have the courage, dedication and downright hustle to do what you did.  Thank you for leading by example in taking ownership of your personal development.  Bravo!\n\n292#Honing your craft|Cam, when you proactively stepped forward to go through sales certification to become better at your job, I was impressed. However, your dedication and quality work in doing so has been inspiring. Doing so not only helps you grow but is a shining example for others to follow. Well done!\n\n293#It takes a village...|Team, I wanted to call out the immense group effort today on an unusual situation. Even the most thorough clients can overlook things during UAT testing and we came across that today. Gulfstream missed that the Timelines digital award messaging was not exactly what they wanted and they had no approval to use the CEO's name on the tool - a serious issue for them. This meant we had over 500 awards to cancel...and reprocess. Due to their extremely custom mgr pack process, we had a lot of systems pieces to work out. Jillian, when I texted you the heads up that I'd need assistance early, you replied with \"Not a prob-we'll get it done!\". You worked the test WBAU with an assist from Nicholas and created the new WBAU that I needed their approval for within an hour of coming in; this included multiple tests of the new award msg. Bill/Amanda/Gavin, we had to figure out how to reprocess all these awards without triggering add'l orders to Allied - thank you for taking the time to work through this very important piece together! We vetted out the scenarios, found the best option and I was able to configure as needed. Cam, as always, you supported through the entire process. While this was a ton of work internally, to the client it did not appear that way; they were happy/appreciative that we could have 500+ awards tested, processed and confirmed within the same business day. I could not have done this without your collaboration, time, effort, support and willingness to get it done. Amazing team effort - thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n294#Over The Hump|Team, as you can see, getting Dell through Recognition and Conversations UAT was a herculean effort from over 15 people on five different internal and external teams. Each and every one of you contributed significantly to help me manage this and I can’t thank you enough. Throughout the past 3 weeks, there have been 80 Jira tickets opened in relation to their UAT – slowness in Sandbox, award highlighting issues, translations galore, static drive updates, invoice updates, email template problems, transformation rules, privacy language changes, login errors, escalations… the list goes on and on. As if everything I just listed wasn’t enough work for you, all of this was going on through ADL issues, general sandbox issues, and releases. A special shout out to Stephen and Yuliya for joining daily calls and helping sift through all the tickets and ensuring the right ones were looked at with urgency. The team has seriously stepped up to resolve all these tickets to help get Dell through UAT. With your help, they are slated to officially sign off on UAT this week! Thank you all for helping Dell through this significant milestone. Your support has truly been invaluable to me.\n\n295#A little help from my friends!|Team, thank you SO very much for all jumping in to help me out while I was out of the office last week getting my eyes lasered (or fixed! however you want to look at it!). This week out of the office was last minute by my standards, and i left with more than a little bit of nerves / anxiety, but the truth is is I never needed to worry (and I knew it!). Joyce, thanks for running with all of Harvard Pilgrim's requests. For such a quiet client, they had lots of questions while I was out, and some of them were completely unrelated to comms. You still jumped in, followed up and made sure they got the answers they needed. Sarah - as always, the yin to my yang with our many launches. DJO was in the best of hands, and you re-scheduled meetings, fielded questions, followed up on outstanding items, and kept the project moving while I was out. Do you even need me anymore?!? And Cam - thank you for stepping up to answer the launch related questions my clients had while they were out. Just having you on my out of office made me feel better, and seeing your responses to questions and hearing how you supported with some of DJO's more nuanced questions - I really can't thank you all enough! THANK YOU!\n\n296#Because of you, we SOAR|Cam, enormous thank you for all your continued support with Gulfstream, post launch. With some bumps in the road in their crazy custom mgr packs, you stayed on after we launched to guide the process, support the technical processes and ease the clients mind - all equally important pieces. You have also proactively done work (setting up the Retirement program in Sandbox so I could demo next day for 1 example) without being asked, which was just plain incredibly kind of you and allowed me to focus on the bigger issues at hand. On top of that, during our handover meeting, we discussed the standard items (unusual processes, relationship knowledge, etc) but also highlighted areas of interest for them that I can now use as I manage the program - coming at it from an account management perspective! This blew me away; proactively knowing these areas of interest means I can add those metrics to the other areas I would normally watch and include in account reviews. Sharing info at this level is priceless for me as the CSM. I cant thank you enough for your work ethic, your time, effort, thinking outside the box and the care you have shown for this client, which is reflected in the relationship I am lucky enough to inherit. You are amazing Cam!\n\n297#Sometimes it takes a village..|Cam, Meghan, and Sam - thank you all for all the support while I was on vacation! I was able to enjoy a few days away knowing my clients were being looked after by you three. Sam, you must've run at least 25 WBAUs in 3 days. You were responsive to urgent requests from important clients, all while balancing you own workload. Cam, thank you for jumping in with Meghan on FINRA and helping get them up and running. I know how much you have on your plate at all times so I greatly appreciate you putting things aside to help investigate. And Meghan, holy cow. I thought our Friday evening of fighting fires would be the last of it, but surely I thought wrong. Thank you for giving a high maintenance client the attention they needed during a tricky situation. You were following up non-stop letting our program team know you were working on it. You were in early on calls with the necessary team and you let me enjoy my time off.   Thank you all again for being rockstars!\n\n298#A series of small things...|Trying to be funny, I was searching for a cheesy teamwork poster to include on this award. I ended up coming across this one with the following quote: \"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" If this is not applicable to our team right now, I don't know what is! You have each jumped in without a single hesitation to help with Dell, Edwards, and PwC over the past couple of weeks - config changes, data file loads, slides, Jira tickets, and more. All of the things that might seem like just one little task or project all add up and are having a big impact to these clients. And for me personally, it just reminds me (literally daily) how lucky I am to work with such an amazing, caring group of people. Thank you so much for being amazing teammates and helping me get through.\n\n299#SOARing to Success|Eboni Lott, the Program Manager for Gulfstream, had just left a post implementation meeting and immediately emailed me their team’s praise. “Hands down, the team agreed that having Cameron Torre as the Implementation Manager for this project made this a successful project for our team.  Throughout the project, he was supportive, flexible, and provided the expertise needed to guide our decisions.  He was receptive to the “quirks” of our business, and offered useful solutions to help navigate roadblocks we faced.  Most importantly, he was very responsive, which made all the difference when we needed to feed information to our business leaders.  I personally agree that it has been a pleasure to work with him.”  As they can’t send you a “Mach Award” from their system, Eboni wanted to recognize your leadership in helping them SOAR to a new platform. Congratulations on building such a positive experience with Gulfstream!\n\n300#SOARing with Gulfstream|Team, a huge thank you for the great work you all did launching Gulfstream this week! The team was excited, had nothing but positive feedback about your work, launch itself and the feedback they've already received from EE's. Cam, you did an amazing job explaining best practices, educating and working with their team to set them up for success now and moving forward, including navigating what could have begun difficult convos with ease, respect & in turn gaining their trust; keeping everyone on track to meet some crazy goals/deadlines and most importantly building a fantastic relationship with the entire group! Danielle, great work on comms - I'm not sure I've seen a team so prepared/excited to get the word out and boy did they! They communicated thoughtfully and were comfortable/confident in the tools they head and how to explain to their EE pop. Thet used different events during the week to really spread the word about SOAR, Thank You Thursday (a day dedicated to sending eThanks during launch wk) being my favorite. Shawn, you were a tremendous support throughout the whole launch & I especially appreciated the assistance this wk. Thank you all for your dedication, knowledge, thoughtfulness, respect and for being the driving force behind such a successful launch!\n\n301#We're Almost At The Finish Line|Lauren, Laura and Cam this recognition is long, long overdue. I want to thank you all for your many contributions over these past months on Western Digital's upcoming launch. From jumping on calls at a moment’s notice to walk the WD team through their many questions/concerns to sharing great content examples and best practices to steer them in the right direction and everything in between. You step up to every challenge, after hours request, and last minute audible WD throws our way. I'm truly thankful to all three of you for all you've done and continue to do. I know WD has been set up for success because they have you guys on their team. Thank you for your leadership, guidance, and dedication!\n\n302#Ready for your close up!|In true Globoforce fashion, when I put the call out for photoshoot models, so many people jumped at the chance to help. A photoshoot like the one we held this week takes true teamwork and the work of many to be successful. I am truly appreciative for all of you who made time and were patient/flexible/available throughout the process. Thank you to those in scheduled shoots and for those I grabbed last minute who were willing to jump right in. The careers website is going to look AMAZING because of so many of you! We are going to have an incredible photo library of our incredible people doing incredible things. Thank you to all of you - I am truly grateful!\n\n303#Akamai Design off and running!|Team, Thank you for putting a great day together for the Akamai Design lab.  Amy, thank you for your leadership on this project. You turned this around in record time and, buit the team to meet the request of Akamai.  Cam and Joyce, great job on leading the discussions today.  Very thoughtful in your responses and your delivery of our materials.  Christa, for being here a month, I was impressed how you handled yourself and your part of the presentation.  Maggie, thank you for your help and taking a lot of notes today. I am excited about this team who is going to help bring something amazing to life at Akamai.  I appreciate your professionalism and quality of work. Cheers\n\n304#Undefined|Thanks Shawn and Cam for setting up the time with Gulfstream today to help with the error that they are getting. It was great to get to see the steps the client takes for this and when the issue occurs so we can hopefully find a resolution. Even if the error seemed to know it was being recorded towards the end of the call and stopped appearing!\n\n305#Thank you|Cam – This is overdue, but I just want you to know how much it means to me that you were there to jump in and take the reins on the Western Digital project. Your involvement started while I was traveling for Dell. When the scope of that project become more apparent, you didn't even ask the question…you just volunteered to continue working with WDC. This was not just a simple thing but a months-long commitment and you did it without a hesitation. I want you to know that I haven’t forgotten this and I am so truly thankful. You are an amazing coworker and an even better friend, and you are very much appreciated!\n\n306#WebEx w/ SPX Flow|Thanks Cam for your prep work, timeline, and deck for this account.  Marlys was impressed! The good news is our stories were the same- she said everything I told her you reiterated.  Hopefully we can bring this home in the next week or so!\n\n307#The entertaining bunch!|Guys thank you so much for making me feel welcome when I was across the pond :-) you gave up your free time to bring me out which let us get to know each other on a personal level. It’s amazing how welcoming I feel when I can get over to you all! I look forward to returning the favour one day :-)\n\n308#Shinning stars for Eaton’s 5 yr Anniversary Video|Thank you so much for volunteering your time and hidden acting dancing and improv talents to celebrate Eaton’s 5 year anniversary team!! They LOVED the video and was super impressed by both your talented acting skills and creativity! Most of all, they appreciate what great partners we are and for always injecting our own special brand of fun with humans and heart at the center of it all! Oscar nominations for everyone!!\n\n309#It Takes A Village...|Team, Maine Med is live with an additional 1400 employees on the platform!!!!!! In January at Ignite, my PM called to talk about adding an additional population of people to the platform. Over the last couple of months, that evolved to 2 new populations, new homepage branding, logo changes, new icons & colors and different approval rules & eligibility rules for each of the 4 populations. Christine and Cam, the 2 of you jumped right in to help me decipher the complex rules and figure out the best way to make them all work! I could not have done it without your help and guidance! Michela, when I was out for the few days, I thought we were all set and all they needed to do was begin testing. Little did I know that they would need to change up the branding and icons again! There was a lot of back and forth that week between that piece and about 100 other questions from them...Thank you for treating them like they were you own client and keep the ball rolling while I was out. Jill & Nick, between the testing, icons, program guidelines, FAQ's and test WBAU's, you 2 killed it every step of the way! There was a ton of requests for changes that came in and all within a 2 week window as they were testing. You 2 took each request in stride and helped make it possible to meet their deadlines! Sarah, thank you for the work you did to get the homepage updated. Right at the last minute, they needed another change done and you made sure it was all set before you went out for your long weekend! Each one of you made this possible and I could not have done it without you! Cheers!!\n\n310#Can we go through this one more time?|Cam and Danielle- where do I even begin? The two of you have been so patient with FINRA and their influx of questions as we get closer to their launch date. Cam, you've taken the time to hop on 4 calls with the PM in the last week to help him understand Spend Management. You have a way of making complex (at least for FINRA) concepts easy to understand. Danielle, you have been working so hard to get the FINRA team trained and explaining to them best practices for their communications. You have waited patiently for their side to make what feels like 10909099090 edits. I'm truly thankful to both of you for all you've done and will continue to do. I know FINRA has been set up success with you guys on the team!\n\n311#Launch Team Sounding Board|Cam - over the past week and a half, Xilinx has taught me so much, but of all the lessons I've learned with this client, the most important has been what an incredible teammate and talented LSM you are! You have proactively checked in with me when you've known I'm about to tackle some of the tougher discussions, and I can't put in words how much I appreciate that! Your insight on how to approach the award levels discussion with them, using the budget tab in the project plan, suggesting two different tracks on how they could structure and having a third to fall back on was HUGELY helpful. As I begin tackling these more complex clients, I'm so very grateful to have someone like you on my team! Thank you for sharing all your experience, your approaches, and your knowledge.\n\n312#Sensei Cam|Cam, thanks so much for your help last week in helping me craft an email back to Plantronics. They had asked some pretty tricky questions and I wanted to ensure I covered all the bases and responded to them in a timely manner. Your support in writing the note was so helpful to me. Thanks for being such a great mentor.\n\n313#Launching success|This past week, each and every one of you has done something amazing to support my clients. Configuration work, managing SOLI tables, following up to make sure branding and SSO were moving forward, answering client questions, taking unexpected meetings...those are just some of the examples of things that you did. What makes these contributions particularly special is that none of you even paused or hesitated to jump in. It means so much to me. It is a truly special thing to work with people who you know will be there for you, and I hope you know that I would do the same for each of you in a heartbeat. I love working with you guys and I cannot tell you how incredibly lucky I feel to be part of this amazing team. Thank you so much for being the best teammates I could ever ask for.\n\n314#Can I ask you one more question???|Cam, thank you so much for your support and proactive leadership this week with Western Digital.  You jumped right in to make sure everything kept moving and that all \"i\" were dotted and \"t\" were crossed (datafiles, soli and taxes...oh my!).  Thank you also for your client facing support and willingness to hop on calls (including one at 9pm!). I'm glad I've finally gotten to see you \"in action\" and hope that one day we'll get to officially work together on a client launch! THANK YOU!!!\n\n315#Gong!|Thank you all for the role you played in the April company meeting - from helping get the slides ready, to making sure I had the correct company logos, to talking about our successes, and then the honorable ringing of the gong - you all helped make the meeting a memorable one. Thank you!\n\n316#All Hands WorkHuman|THANK YOU so much for dropping everything and helped out when alerts went out on GroupMe last week!!! It was a crazy busy week and you all made a point to come running when we needed extra hands!!! It was great to see everyone pop in when needed with smiles on there faces ready to help!!! Thanks again!!!\n\n317#Launching into 2018|What a great day we had at our offsite and that is thanks to each one of you! We had fresh ideas and revised approaches to tackling some of our biggest challenges during launch. I appreciate everyone’s unique perspective and when you put them altogether, we strengthen our processes to provide our customers with the best program, launch experience and partnership. I look forward to a successful year ahead of us with this amazing team!\n\n318#FINRA handoff : smooth and complete|Cam, Danielle, Rachel and Shawn, you all make a great team, and I saw you all in action for the FINRA kickoff call and surrounding efforts to align FINRA to best practices along the way.   It takes not only the knowledge but also the people skills to navigate the tricky corners of gross up, award values, workday/IT resource issues, and time management.  End of the day, though, our contact there is seeing the high level of activity occurring and he is pleased!   So, on to success at FINRA.  Nice work, all!  Rog\n\n319#Fasten your seatbelts...|Horizon Air has taken off! Cam, congratulations on the launch of Horizon. During our handover call Horizon expressed how grateful they are that they went with Globoforce and specifically how happy they were to work with you. Direct quote from their team: \"This launch was well rolled out and well supported even as we put you under a fast timeline.\" They went on to say that you were adaptable, very clear, and that they knew what they needed to do and when, thanks to your guidance. They felt their launch experience, while new for them, was a well-trodden path that other had travelled before and you were the perfect guide. On top of all of that they proactively offered to be a reference! Amazing work!\n\n320#Making it rain recognition!|Cam, I wanted to share and applaud you for one of my favorite Gulfstream Design Lab moments - your use of Eric's recognition calendar moments slide from Ignite (I was psyched to see you included it in the deck). I watched our client as the slide updated & it was impactful, but the greatest impact I saw on their faces was how you spoke to it! We just saw this for the first time a few weeks ago but you spoke to it clearly & thoughtfully, as if you'd been doing it for years. Kudos on jumping in with something new, handling it so well & making an impact with our new client!\n\n321#...and after Midnight in Dublin|When Meghan and Cam first called Noel, who then called Mike, who then called Tony.. .and  then we got Louise out of bed!   Shortly after the clock struck midnight in Dublin, we were validating that GE's Spend Management budget was live when we ran into an error trying to nominate.  We reached out to the team, who jumped out of bed to help resolve the issue.  Within 2 hours, we were back in action, having identified a true edge case that had occurred in the Finance MD App. Frances and her team were grateful for the quick resolution so that Monday, February 5th - the Global re-launch day could be a complete success around the world!    I just want to personally thank each one of you for truly understanding the sense of urgency and putting the customer first - ahead of sleep, and for Cam - the Superbowl!  I was so proud to be part of this amazing team, who always has my back!\n\n322#Flying High at Gulfstream|I wanted to thank each of you for your contributions to a fantastic design lab with Gulfstream.  The energy in the room was palpable and the comments from the Gulfstream team at the end was clear validation of how excited they are.  I've been through many design labs and this was clearly one of the most upbeat and energized ones I've seen.  They are positioned to have a great program with a transformative impact on their culture.  I'm really looking forward to seeing this program come to life over the next few months.\n\n323#We have lift off|Cam, what an amazing impact you had on the recent GE launch.  Working as Meghan's right hand through all the up's and down's, your contribution was absolutely critical to the success of this project.  Your ability to keep all the internal teams on track and on time allowed us to deliver on all our promises to GE.  While it might not have seemed so on the ground and in the day to day moments, that seamless progress provided an atmosphere of \"smooth sailing\".  It delivered the customer confidence we needed to ensure that the critical executive discussions surrounded communications and ideal program design rather than troubleshooting technical or operational issues.  I know that this entailed sacrificing many late nights and weekends from your personal time and I hope you know that it was both noticed and appreciated.  On behalf of the company, the customer and 300,000 GE employees, I salute you.  Well done!!\n\n324#Citi praise to Team Globoforce|Team Citi!  The positive news continues to roll in this week from Citi.  I wanted to pass along this incredible feedback that the Program Manager shared with the broader Citi team on our last call.  Natalie took a few minutes to call out the “amazing” partnership we’ve created with the Citi team over the past 18 months (and beyond!).  No matter what they ask from us, “Globoforce has made the entire Citi team feel like they are our only client”.  She also made it a point to call out Citi will be sending an \"official\" letter of thanks to the entire Globoforce team.  This goes all the way back to the design discussions last year, all the work that’s gone into the program from the Applause launch, Gratitude phase 2 launch with points in November, working through the amendment and redemption conversations to the final launch this past weekend.  Natalie made it a point to mention each of you by name, so amazing work everyone!  Thanks for all the blood, sweat and tears to getting us to where we are today.  Citi employees will benefit for years as a result of your incredible efforts.\n\n325#A smooth landing|Cam, fantastic work with the recent launch of Horizon Air! While I know there was some turbulence approaching the final destination, this was absolutely the smoothest customer launch I’ve ever worked on, even given the fairly quick implementation timeline. Congratulations on boosting Horizon Air’s employees through the power of thanks. And thank you for being a great teammate — this was our first time partnering together on a launch, and I look forward to the next one. On to Alaska!\n\n326#Almost There!|Cam,  I just wanted to take a moment to celebrate all of the work you've done over the last 3 months getting GE ready for re-launch day, this coming Monday, February 5th!  We truly are in the \"home stretch\" with last minute tweaks and client jitters - walking folks through things on a daily basis - sometimes multiple times a day!  You've been critical in keeping all of the internal teams on track and ensuring we are truly READY for the big day.  It's been wonderful working side-by-side with you on this project and truly appreciate your patience with my sometimes crazy style. We are in such an amazing place with one week to go and you have played a key role in this.  THANK YOU!!!\n\n327#All Around The World!|Congrats on winning the Passport Contest at the Monday Night event!!!! I am so glad everyone enjoyed themselves and you got to taste all the wonderful food and drinks at all 6 countries!!! Hope you enjoy you apron and cook many meals with it on :)\n\n328#Our first Recognition and Conversations customer!|Congratulations on launching First Technology Credit Union, our FIRST customer to launch with Recognition and Conversations. This was a fun journey with them from the start and it continued throughout the process as we integrated both critical work streams. You and Chary Krout, the Exec Sponsor, played off each other’s positivity in every call creating an encouraging and collaborative environment, which was critical in this scenario. I smell a WorkHuman customer award nomination for next year on this amazing milestone! Congratulations on all your hard work!\n\n329#Customer Success ROCKS!|I have been so impressed with each of you and the work you done with customers on Conversations.  You handle customers with respect, positivity, and grace.  When a customer is frustrated, i have seen you all manage to calm the customer down and enable them to focus on the issues/business at hand.  I realize Conversations has been a bit uncomfortable in terms of it being a new product but you all jumped in, head first, and said 'bring it on'.  You do a great job balancing the needs of the Globoforce business with the customer needs.  I appreciate all of your honesty as you provide feedback on what is working, what is not working, and advocating for the customer.  I worked with many different CSM teams and by far, you folks are the best.\n\n330#JLL Rock Stars!|Kara and Cam,  I just wanted to say thank you for all your help and guidance with JLL.  In the two months since I've taken over the account you have both helped me tremendously with all of the different program changes that have taken place.  I'm happy to say that we're at the finish line and will be launching 3 new programs in addition to Timelines on Monday 1/8.  The client is extremely pleased with the service Globoforce has provided and also the seamless account transition over to me as CSM.  This would not have been possible without your support.  Thank you both for taking the time to work with me on this account and I believe we're certainly set up for success in the future with JLL!    Tim\n\n331#Dream Team!!|The Branding Team want to say a big thank you to all you guys for your super teamwork throughout the year. Its been a phenomenal year with an incredible amount of clients but with out two teams woking together theres nothing that we can't do and no client that we can't cater too. Thank you all so much for your continued support throughout the year and heres to another successful year in 2018! Thank You!! =D\n\n332#Citi Saturday launch party|Cam, what an incredible job you this past weekend leading all of Citi's launch activities.  You were in charge of the total situation across all the many, many steps throughout the weekend.  This required quite a bit of work and pulling together all the various internal resources to ensure the launch was flawless...and you did it!  I was impressed with how you calmly stay focused with all the different unique requests that came up and helped find a solution in moving things forward with the client.  The Citi team was in your capable hands and it was clear you had their absolute trust in ensuring everything was done to perfection before the day was over.  I know you've spent a ton of time with this very smart and technically proficient Citi team for the past year, but your efforts have clearly paid off  in helping to launch a successful program.  The team was singing your praises for getting this launch off the ground and you deserve a ton of credit and more.  You have done am amazing job and have left your imprint on tens of thousands of employees.  Nice work!\n\n333#You Just \"Get it\"|Cam,  I was so excited that we got to pull you onto our GE team...and you have exceeded my expectations.  The thoughtfulness that you bring and simply your \"can do\" attitude makes you a perfect fit, both internally and externally.  You got up to speed quickly and have jumped in with both feet - participating in 2 grueling days and never breaking a sweat, or losing your smile.  You have integrated seamlessly into the fabric of this team and I couldn't be more proud to have you along for the journey.  Buckle up - as I know the next few months will be quite a ride, and I have every confidence that you will be one of the keys to a successful delivery.\n\n334#6 programs and still counting!|Not 1, not 3 but 6 partner programs for JLL in two phases and we are still counting! This has been a launch for the ages with a few more grey hairs for all. You lead this client through a temporary PM change while the main PM was on maternity leave, through the eligibility complexity 6 different ways, our extraordinary testing and their data file challenge. Each piece needed a thorough and thoughtful approach to understand all downstream impacts to their overall success. We did a wonderful job managing the complexity of this unique client and Congrats on the JLL launches!\n\n335#UI Team Visit|Guys, on behalf of the UI team- I just want to thank you all so much for taking the time last week to meet us and introduce yourselves to Kevin. It was really great to get an overview on what challenges both teams face and how we can try work the solutions into our new and improved processes. We all really enjoyed spending time sitting with you all, you made us feel very welcome! We hope we can afford you the same hospitality when you guys are over this side of the pond!\n\n336#The BEST!!!!!!!|Cam, thank you SO much for all you did to help me make sure that MasterLock's program was correct. You took over as the LSM right before they launched and transitioned them to me very shortly after. Little did either of us know what we had in store with them post launch. There was one thing wrong after another and it got to the point where they did not trust in us or their program. To fix this, I promised a full audit on all of their configurations. You jumped right in and helped me out. You were my second set of eyes and you did this with the little knowledge that you had of the program, with a million other things on your plate and while you were away on vacation. You helped me make sure that we caught and fixed everything that was identified, helped to make sure the new config document was correct and made me feel completely confident in everything when I spoke to Julie. At the end of the call, she thanked me for all that we did and she felt a whole lot better about everything. Thank you for helping me rebuild her trust in us and for being an awesome teammate! You are the BEST!!!!!!!!!\n\n337#JLL - Opening New Doors|We knew that the launching JLL was going to have some challenges, but we also knew that Globoforce was the only partner that had the experience and capability to make them successful. They're not even live yet, and the fantastic work you've put in is already leading to other new opportunities! I just had a meeting with Compass Group, a 220, 000 Employee company that provides foodservice and support services for other large companies. We've spent the last 2 years trying to find business teams  at Compass to help support HR's recognition initiative. It turns out that JLL and Compass both support Google. The great work you've done on the Google portion of the JLL launch has lead to that team telling the Compass Google Team about the amazing experience! That's the connection we've been trying to create, and your support of JLL helped us get there. Amazing work! Thank you so much for all your effort and for doing all the little things that matter. They do make a difference!\n\n338#Mood Tracker Part 4|Your enthusiasm to continually craft your Mood Tracker conversation based on your last 3 client experiences is fantastic. Take 4 on your overall approach had a positive response from the client, plus sharing your experiences/revised deck with the team was valuable for all to continue learning and evolving the conversation.\n\n339#Thank you for your brain power!|Thank you for participating in the brainstorm to help us develop answers on behalf of the company for the Great Place to Work survey. The employee portion is now complete, and now we're tasked with writing about what it's like to work here and the programs and perks we offer. Thank you for talking through what you think makes Globoforce great, and for helping us think about the stories we have to tell and the photos we can share to bring our story to life. \"Teamwork makes the dream work.\" Thank you, for being part of this team!\n\n340#\"True Partners\"|It's such a pleasure to receive customer feedback on the dedication you give on a launch. Julie Rader at Master Lock was knocking down doors to share her  feedback - \"I can’t say enough about Cameron.  He took over our account as the project manager from Paul Corbierso in late March.  I was a bit nervous at first transitioning project managers at that stage, but Cameron instantly put those fears to rest.  He was engaged and on top of things and seems to very genuinely care about the success of the program.  I have been extremely impressed with his level of professionalism, follow-through and ability to help us trouble shoot issues and concerns.   In the end, Cameron came through and truly helped save the day.  We were having some major technical issues (not due to the fault of Globoforce) and he went above and beyond to make things happen for us and help make our launch successful.  He’s a true partner and someone I would have on my  team any day.\"  And to top it off, she's \"been very impressed and happy with the quality of service and product from Globoforce\", that she is now a referenceable client less than a week into their launch! Congrats on such wonder sentiments!\n\n341#C-Powered|You rolled up your sleeves with a positive attitude when you were asked to step in and lead MasterLock through the rest of their implementation with one month to go. You immediately recognized a few items that needed realignment to ensure they launched with a successful program and on time. On top of that, you were able to gain the trust of their program manager in the first few days of your engagement based on those realignments and the strategy conversations you discussed. Fantastic job on leading MasterLock's M-Powered Recognition Program with confidence both internally and externally!\n\n342#M-Powering Our Customers!|Thank you, thank you, thank you for helping The Master Lock Company's IT team solve their challenges with the Vanity URL setup for their upcoming April 24 launch.  We have created beautiful communications and training pieces which contain the Vanity URL so that employees can quickly and easily access the new program.  When the customer experienced many challenges with the Vanity URL setup, all of the printed materials that contained this URL were at risk.  You were inventful and went above and beyond to create a solution that worked for them and ensured the use of the materials that had already been printed for their launch events.  The time you spent on this solution saved the customer several thousands of dollars.  During a call yesterday, the program manager commented how amazing this team has been and how happy she is with the support from our team.\n\n343#Marathon in Chicago|Good thing you are training for a marathon, Cameron, because the transferable skills --perseverance, grit and thoughtful pacing-- have served you very well in your interactions with JLL. Yesterday's design lab was rife with potential tripping points, but you navigated each challenge with poise. Under your leadership, Katie and her team now have a clearer understanding of the product's functionality, good guidance on our suggestions for best practice, and awareness of the key/common decisions their team has to make in order to move the project forward. This was a major contribution - you have a lot to be proud of!\n\n344#thank - U|Thank UMUCh is what they said and you listened.  i am very impressed at how you handled the kickoff with UMUC and were able to come up with solutions with such a large number of attendees.  I know that they are going to be successful with you guys at the helm.  Really...hugs from the customer...Great Job!\n\n345#Everything Citi!|Thank you very much for all of your help thus far for Citi's Phase 1 launch.   I have heard numerous times from Citi that your support is very well received and valuable.   Looking forward to Phase 2 (the tough one...)\n\n346#The Master of MasterLock|Cam, I just wanted to recognize the amazing work you did thus far with MasterLock. You came into the project with just a  few weeks left until launch and you have killed it! I know this has not been easy for you to pick up with all the other launches you have on your plate, but they way you are leading them, it makes me feel like you have been on the account since day one with Lauren and me. After this weeks' great call, I know they have 100% trust in you and I can tell how happy they are that you joined their project. Thanks in great part to you, their program is going to be a success. Thank you so much for all you have done so far. Great job, Cam!\n\n347#Solid Coverage|Wanted to recognize you for helping cover my accounts while I was away.    If felt good not  to worry about the ongoing support of those accounts.   My clients have indicated that they felt as if they were in good hands!  Thank you.\n\n348#Varex Launch|Thank you Cam, for your hard work and dedication to launching Varex! As a spinoff of Varian, it’s key the customer feels lead and supported as with their prior company. You did a fantastic job managing that piece of the relationship, on top of all the moving pieces of their launch. Excellent job!\n\n349#Didn't miss a beat with Citi|Cam, thanks so much for the leadership you have shown throughout our Citi launch process.  The most impressive part for me has been the way you jumped in since Matt has been out with his growing family.  You made sure that you were fully versed in all of the launch steps, technology aspects, Citi stakeholders, and deliverables BEFORE Matt went out, so that when that happened you did not miss a beat.  I know that you have continued our progress with this demanding customer and have moved the ball forward on several key initiatives.  Thanks so much for the quality and urgency you bring to this opportunity every day.\n\n350#Always thinking of your colleagues|Cam, I want to thank you for your respect for teamwork.  We are working on several customers and they're making some last-minute tweaks or have some requests that impact both of our teams.  You're there keeping the line of communication open so that we can easily work together.  You're just one step ahead and always on the ball.  Thank you for thinking about my team and making sure we're informed.\n\n351#Ann & Robert H Lurie Childrens Hospital Launch|Cameron, I want to recognize the tremendous effort you put into your first launch.  I know you have been part of other launches, but Lurie was your first launch in which you were the sole LSM voice.  While I had the pleasure of shadowing your calls and your progress with this customer, you did all the work, from start to finish!  You did a fantastic job of shepherding your customer through a number of launch challenges, always being their advocate for the best recognition program for Lurie.  I look forward to seeing you launch many more customers.  You did an outstanding job!\n\n352#Heineken Heroes|Team - a wonderful job by all today at the Heineken design lab.  The presentation was organized, succinct, and flowed seemlessly.  Heineken USA, no matter the size of the deal, felt today like they were all that mattered to Globoforce!  As a team you all did a great job making them feel loved and important!  They will be a great client and hopefully we can use this instance to have the tail wag the dog all the way to Amsterdam!  Well done!\n\n353#Project A-Team|Michela, Chris, Cam I want to thank you for jumping in on a brand new project, with a tight deadline, little notice and not a lot of details.  While the goal was clearly defined, the path to reaching that goal was not.  You were always willing take on tasks even though the details of each task were not always complete.  You remained open and enthusiastic throughout the project.  It was an absolute pleasure to work with each of you and I will absolutely jump at any opportunity to work with any one of you again. With our efforts, our teammates will be better prepared, which will increase their confidence, and as a result, our clients will adopt new features at an incredible pace. Thank you!\n\n354#Citi Backup|Thank you for your ongoing support in the Launch of Citi.   With 7 distinct work streams and not less than 50 client contacts, your assistance continues to be invaluable to this launch.    Here's to getting it all done in 2017!\n\n355#Wesco Timelines & More...|Thank you Cam for jumping in to deliver Wesco Timelines successfully in Q4.  Thank you also for your tremendous support on General Cable - you really have shown us the value that you bring to our team!  Since you have joined you have jumped right in and taken accountability and ownership for every project you touch!  Now having taken on Ann & Laurie Hospital, Varex and Heineken as your first solo new launches, I am excited to see these successfully launched in the new year!  You are also supporting both the MasterCard and Citi launches on top of your solo launches!  Great work Cam!  Thank you for demonstrating our values of determination, imagination, innovation and respect every day!  We are delighted to have you on the team and I look forward to achieving great things together in 2017!  Happy New Year!\n\n356#Timeliness Warriors|Team, thank you so much for the extraordinary effort to get Wesco timelines with commemorative items up and running in such a short amount of time.  On Wednesday the Client made it very clear we could not delay the launch and we rallied within two days to put all the pieces together to Go Live on time.  Thank you again for your focus and dedication in pull us through what could have been a very disappointed Client.  To quote Michelle from Wesco when we informed her we would be going live on time..\"You just made my day, thank you.\"  Well  done to all!\n\n357#High-performing team|A high-performance team can be defined as a group of people with specific roles and complementary talents and skills, aligned with and committed to a common purpose, who consistently show high levels of collaboration and innovation, that produce superior results.  I had the pleasure of having my first Launch Success Manager team meeting yesterday, focused on refining the Customer Success Coordinator - Launch Success role, as Shawn will be joining us on Monday.    Everyone showed up prepared with their think-ahead ideas, participated, and supported each others ideas (even when there were different ideas), etc. Together, we developed a comprehensive and actionable plan, and are ready for Shawn on Monday.  Thank you!\n\n358#Launch Success!|Cam - Thank you for being such an incredible teammate both on the General Cable project and beyond! From the moment we got assigned the GC launch, you have displayed so many of our values, including quality, urgency, and imagination. But more than anything, you have shown dedication to teamwork and to the customer on a daily basis! You have been right there to support every piece of the project, from the hundreds of little daily questions to the more complicated pieces, including managing the entire data file process, completing the site configuration, and handling ALL of the user acceptance testing feedback. Your enthusiasm for learning every piece of the launch process and making it an incredible experience for the customer is obvious. In addition to GC, you have helped me with so many countless tasks for other clients, including last week when I ran into a difficult situation that required canceling hundreds of awards. You immediately jumped in to help me without hesitation. I am so grateful that you are part of our team and so proud of everything you have already accomplished in such a short time. Congratulations on your first launch and keep up the absolutely amazing work!\n\n359#Let's Bravo!|Thank you so much for your professional urgency and confident composure on our first call with Varex Imaging.  This has been months in the making.  I think they feel super confident that they are in incredibly competent hands with this team.  Many thanks for squeezing this first meeting into your holiday week and being so prepared to knock it out of the park.  Looking so forward to this launch!  Bravo!\n\n360#Appropriate Investment|Cam, it was such a pleasure to hear your commitment to 1% as part of a recent client launch.  Rather than simply launching an underfunded program, you went the extra mile to show them not only how their intended investment lagged compared to best practices but also by finding and illustrating the investment per employee (IPE) data for industry peers as an additional proof point. That's remarkable awareness and dedication from someone so new to recognition.  It is these little details that will make all the difference in bringing WorkHuman to the employees of our customers. Well done.\n\n361#General Cable Excellence|One of the greatest privileges in my role is hearing wonderful feedback from customers about the team members who are making their recognition culture happen.  This is what General Cable had to say...  \"As you know, we successfully kicked-off our BRAVO launch yesterday and I wanted to reach out to share our sentiments about the Globoforce implementation team who have been active partners to us over the past 57 days.   From our initial design lab through yesterday’s implementation, Lauren, Erin and Cameron have truly been exceptional partners to each person within our project team.  They have demonstrated exceptional creative problem-solving, attention to detail, responsiveness, and great customer service.   We’ve been extremely impressed with their sense of urgency, solution knowledge, and genuine desire to work as active partners in helping us to  develop and implement the right solution for General Cable!  They truly felt like an extension of our internal project team which is an ideal partnership when working quickly to implement a complex global solution.  We were blessed to have them assigned to our project – and, I’d say, Globoforce is extremely blessed to have each of them as part of your organization!  Erin, Lauren, and Cameron – thank you for your partnership on both large and small matters over the past two months. BRAVO to each of you!!!\"  Bravo indeed!  Well done!\n\n362#Lurie|Amy Cuddy suggests that we make snap judgments about others based on two things: warmth and competence. Cam, you demonstrate both of those qualities so well, as evidenced today in the first weekly call with Lurie. I sense that the Lurie team already trusts you and appreciates your consideration, preparedness, and timely follow-through. Well done!\n\n363#Great Kickoff|Cam and Naomi, great job on the Lurie Kickoff call yesterday.  I was very impressed with both of your presentations and I can't believe it was your first time leading one of these calls with a client.  Lurie had over 10 people in attendance and they all stayed engaged, asked questions and were enthusiastic throughout the meeting.  You both handled their questions with ease and also asked your own meaningful questions that will help set this up for a successful and timely launch.  As the CSM for this client, I already appreciate the teamwork and collaboration that you're putting into this launch, and I know the client is in great hands with both of you leading the way. Great job and congratulations on a successful kickoff call!\n\n364#Mind Reader|When Alice told me that you would be shadowing on MasterCard I was happy that we would get a chance to work together. Seconds after the account was assigned to us and without me saying a word or talking over next steps you reviewed the contract and sales handover document, filled out the project plan, updated Salesforce and created the introduction deck. Thank you taking the initiative to jump right in - no questions asked - and just get stuff done. You are such an amazing addition to the team. Thanks for all your enthusiasm and help, it is very much appreciated.\n\n365#Emails, emails and more emails|Thanks for all your help testing the Lilly emails. I realize this is not an easy task and very time consuming. It takes such patience and attention to detail. You guys are the best!!\n\n366#Launch & Learn Support|Thank you Cam for your constant support of the team as we prepared for and delivered the first launch and learn. You joined just a few short weeks ago and were present at every prep session offering your support throughout.  You are a real team player and we are fortunate to have you on the team.  Thank you!\n\n367#Go Team Waters!|What an impressive showing at Waters today, thanks to you! This Design Lab was a true team effort – maybe the most inclusive I’ve been involved in. Every single person played a role and that’s certainly what led to such a successful day with this new customer. Rich – you were so impressive! You’re so knowledgeable about our product and implementation process, and you were prepared, relaxed, customer-focused and funny. What a great partner. You made this easy and I’m grateful for the chance to work alongside you on this. Chris – you established yourself firmly as the long-term go-to by kicking off and wrapping up so professionally and creating some nice rapport with the customer. You did a great job of conveying the level of support they can expect from GF. Surely they feel confident in our partnership with you at the helm. Naomi – While technically there to shadow, you made some key contributions (as is your way) in getting the team prepped. Thank you for managing nearly all of the logistics singlehandedly like the deck edits, endless uploads and downloads and coming up with the M&M intro idea. Cam – I loved how enthusiastic you were! I’m so glad you personally got a lot out of the day. And thank you for sharing your smart observations about millennials and performance management. So on-point. Scott – you provided a seamless bridge between the sales experience and the customer experience. Thank you for your enthusiastic and support-exuding opening remarks, for jumping in during the demo and adding some great perspective throughout the day. It’s obvious how much the customer respects and trusts you. Together we planted seeds today that will grow to become a culture changing movement at Waters! Go Team!   P.S. Hi, my name is Julio. Just call me Chuck.\n\n368#Cam of all Trades|Cam, I can't thank you enough for all of the client work and intense research you have helped me with over the past few weeks.  From configuration to testing to in depth analysis, all of this work took many hours and careful diligence.  You hopped right on the projects and worked accurately and swiftly.  Newbie shmewbie!  You've come up to speed so fast you are already a veteran!  Because of you, I was able to keep client deliverables on time per the expectations of those customers.  That speaks volumes in our customers' eyes and strengthens our relationships and overall trust with them. THANK YOU!\n\n369#Jumping In|Cam thank you for jumping right in and helping with Lilly. Your ability to quickly understand and comprehend some of the most complex pieces of an implementation is exceptional. We are all very excited to have you as part of the Launch Team. Welcome!!\n\n370#Week one superstar!|Cam - Congratulations on a great first week at Globoforce! I can't believe you have only been here for a few days, since you are already picking things up so quickly. You've been asking great questions all week, and when following along with Sony's calls and emails, I can see you making connections. There is so much to learn, but you don't seem at all daunted by it. You are off to an amazing start and we are thrilled to have you on the launch team!\n\n"
