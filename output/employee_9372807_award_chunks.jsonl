"0#Signify and Lloyds are live|Matt, I really wanted to recognise you for all the support in these two launches. Launching enterprises can be challenging for different reasons, and you were always there to support me, was it during our 1-1's, or if I asked if you had a moment for a quick connect. What I really appreciate is that you always held the space, so I could tell where I was, how I was feeling, my plan to each of the situations I brought to you. You always bring your experience and expertise when necessary, and also let me try my own way. You definitely helped to navigate very complex situations and stakeholders, but never imposed your way. If both customers are live now and up to a great start is also because of your coaching, mentoring and guidance. I really appreciate you!\n\n1#A Successful Return to Mid-Market!|Thank you all so much for your teamwork and support as we navigated the first Mid-Market launch since the return of Mid-Market! Caroline and Will, thank you for being so responsive and helping with the API addendum and providing context and additional details around my many questions as I started with Mortgage Connect. It was clear from Day 1 that you built an incredible foundation with Jaclyn and these additional pieces helped me keep that going. Matt and Rich, thank you for being there to brainstorm with me and offer suggestions around the current and future state of Mid-Market. The process Mortgage Connect experienced benefited from our discussions, and I know our learnings will improve key components of the launch experience for Mid-Market clients as we move forward. Judith, thank you for being my sounding board and talking through past and current experiences for Mid-Market clients. In many ways we started over with the Mid-Market process, and I'm grateful for your tribal knowledge and advice. I'm excited for our continued partnership and to see what's to come in the Mid-Market space!\n\n2#U.S. Bank Support!|Matt and Rich, Thank you both for the tremendous support you've provided this week for U.S. Bank. Rich I truly appreciate you jumping on several quick calls and generously offering your time to help navigate some complex program challenges. Your support makes all the difference in this launch! Matt thank you for meeting with me multiple times and for joining the call with U.S. Bank to help clarify concepts like SOLI. Your presence was incredibly valuable. These interactions go a long way, and between the two of you, I’ve felt massively supported. I genuinely appreciate your time and guidance! Thank you both!\n\n3#US Bank Master Class|I want to commend you both for putting on an absolute master class during our recent call with US Bank. In just one hour, you covered a wide range of topics—SOLI, Premium Merchants, Expiration Dates, WD API feed timing, Cancelling Awards, Spend Management, and even the value of a good sticker (LOL!)—all 30 days before launch!  Matt, you did an incredible job showing USB that Workhuman is a true partner. You navigated complex topics with thoughtfulness and empathy, making it clear that we’re committed to their success.  Jessica, it’s obvious you’ve built a strong and trusting relationship with Kerry. Your ability to foster constructive discussions, find compromises, and drive solutions is a huge asset.  I’m genuinely excited to see this partnership with USB grow, thanks to the seeds you’ve planted and the care you’ve taken to ensure a successful launch.\n\n4#Sales Contest Success—One Piece at a Time!|I want to express my sincere gratitude for your incredible work on the Gilead Sales Contest launch and the successful integration with Gilead’s new payroll system. With the first wave of award winners receiving their awards tomorrow, the results of your dedication and collaboration are already coming to life. This launch reminds me of assembling a puzzle. Each piece may look simple on its own, but when placed with care and intention, they come together to form a complete and beautiful picture. Each contribution—no matter how behind-the-scenes—was essential to making this program feel seamless and impactful. Shelly, your compelling storytelling and impactful slides brought the Benefits of Points and Social Recognition to life. I’m looking forward to hearing client feedback and seeing how their teams engage socially when the time comes. Together, we guided our client into an elegant program and award structure that delivered the simplicity and flexibility they needed. Brittany, your thoughtful coordination and testing across UAT, invoicing, and payroll ensured a fully tested backend experience, making expert use of the WBAU feature functionality. Thank you for the extra assist in troubleshooting the WBAU billing amount—it made a real difference. Margarita, your time, care, and patience kept this project connected to the broader vision of Gilead’s Gratitude program. Mike, your consistent presence and strategic notes have are sincerely appreciated. Divya and Daniela, your skillful updates to the templates were the finishing touches that helped demonstrate our respect for the customer experience. Blending Sales and Payroll—two worlds that rarely intersect—is no small feat, but your collaboration made it possible. Thank you for helping us complete this picture—I’m deeply grateful to work alongside such a talented and dedicated team.\n\n5#Protecting the base|Matt, thank you so much for being my OOO coverage for 10 days.  While I was on holiday, it's great to know that as a trusted partner, you will make decisions, ensuring that teammates throughout the organization are able to continue moving forward on their work.  Situations including, but not limited to, RTX RFP, Service Modeling, Early Planning Guidance support, mid-market, and so much more.  With your leadership, I am able to return to the office, checking off items, rather than creating an enormous follow up list.  It's one thing to support a teammate to keep \"the ship afloat\" it is a whole new level ensuring the \"ship\" continues to make progress.  Thank you for again for your determination and decisiveness!\n\n6#Celebrating IM'PACT Points!|We are thrilled to celebrate the successful post-launch addition of IM'PACT points recognition, benefiting over 14,000 employees across 40 countries. This milestone includes the new Outlook integration and a company-wide Mental Health Awareness Month award.  This achievement is a testament to the dedication of the WH team in supporting Moody’s robust plan for launching R&R, while strategically preparing for future reporting and WH iQ partnership.  A heartfelt thank you to Erin for your strategic and authentic approach, offering invaluable guidance drawn from your extensive experience. Kat, your steadfast skill in managing Moody’s customer relationship, navigating complex requests around reporting, security, and unique use cases, has been truly commendable. Luisa, your technical acumen and elite problem-solving skills were instrumental throughout the launch milestones, especially on launch day, where your collaboration with Ruchi proved critical in resolving a key issue. Dom, your support in meetings and documentation was essential as Moody’s became our first client to go live with the new Outlook integration. Julian and Sophia, your efforts in building and strengthening our partnership with Moody’s from Lisa Monaco’s appearance at Activate have been truly impactful.  A sincere thank you to our leadership, technical, and QA teams for your commitment to delivering on recognition done right!\n\n7#A 'Collective Thanks' to MillerKnoll Launch Team!|Join us in celebrating the launch of the MillerKnoll Difference Makers platform, eThanks Recognition, Celebrations Bundle, and Automated Welcome Award to 10,380 employees in 30 countries!  Additionally, this launch incorporated both our Workday and MS Teams integrations. MillerKnoll's recognition is flowing across the globe and across all 15 brands, and associates are clamoring for more, as you can see from the awesome recognition moment above.  Excitingly, we'll be adding points recognition in the coming months! 🌍🎉 While this launch had its twists and turns, our launch team remained steadfast. Lauren, your guidance around change management and communications was excellent and earned the trust of the entire MillerKnoll team. Jao, I valued your technical partnership and communications, ensuring a smooth and critical UAT and launch. Ihar and Val, your support from a branding perspective was brilliant. Our client takes their brand very seriously, and you navigated it with grace and skill. Naomi, it’s the nerd in me, but one of my favorite parts of this launch was working with you on delivering a 'tune-up' on our approach to setting user privacy for MK associates upon dataload in EU countries due to GDPR concerns. Divya, your support in making technical tweaks for this launch was critical and timely – I appreciate you. Thank you to leadership and our broader technical and QA team for meeting our client where they were on their recognition journey, allowing associates to come together to create a harmonized, global, and equitable recognition program. I would like to offer a 'Collective Thanks' to this fantastic launch team. IYKYK! 😉\n\n8#Help with Certification Practice|Matt, thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule today to help me practice for my HI demo certification later this week. You've been so generous with your time, and offered me a safe space to do a run through before having to present to the certifiers. You were kind enough to share some tidbits about your experience as well, to prepare me for what may come up. This helps me feel more confident going into the certification, and I really appreciate you!\n\n9#HI Certified|Matt, thank you for taking the time to prepare and present on new Human Intelligence feature set.  You had feedback that included \"Great Intro!\", \"Good overview\", \"Solid Explanation overall\", and folks like your use of term \"battle tested\".  Presenting to other Workhuman folks is never easy, you are out there leading the way.  Thank you for taking the time to invest in this important initiative.\n\n10#Thanks for the Paternity Leave Coverage!|Matt and Rich - thank you both for your support and coverage while I was away for the last 8 weeks taking care of Evelyn. This was a time in my life where I was able to fully focus on my family and spend meaningful time with Evelyn each day. Matt, you stepped in right as my leave started to work on a UMass escalation, helped facilitate leaves for multiple employees, and took over specific launch projects for FM Global and Seadrill. Rich, you worked to set me up for the most success as I came back yesterday, giving me a weekly play-by-play document from each of the past 8 weeks to show me the changes that took place while I was gone and working with Matt as changes on my team came up. Thank you both, I appreciate the support!!\n\n11#Stars on Zentiva Stars|Rich and Matt, we couldn't launch Zentiva today without thanking both of you for all the help you offered from the moment I was assigned to the account. Matt, you stayed connected with me, especially when we had to navigate the gross-up and the budget challenges. Rich, every time we had our 1-1 you would ask me about Zentiva, and would offer guidance any time I need, sometimes I didn't even need to ask. Also, with all the changes Zentiva requested the week prior to their launch, you offered to QA our work and also, but also helped us to change them to make sure they were future proof. I really appreciate both of you!\n\n12#Workday Mock call|Kat and Matt, I wanted to take a moment recognise you both for the time yesterday to do a mock WD kick-off call, it was very useful for me to calibrate my talk-tracks. Kat, thank you for organising it and providing feedback as I was presenting. It was very helpful. Matt, thank you for joining us, asking questions as if you were the customer, and telling me how I could polish my answers. Yesterday’s session was very good, I appreciate you both!\n\n13#Solution finders!|Team, I wanted to thank you all for your efforts in troubleshooting to get the Reflection Admin rule for our Spark site working! Over the last few weeks this team was part of several meeting, more than one Jira ticket and lots of testing to get to a resolution to ensure the Admins had the right access going into the 3rd round of Reflections! Thank you!\n\n14#The Launch Leaders! 2024|As we wrap up 2024, I wanted to extend my sincerest appreciation for this incredible group of humans! This year has been different from my first two at Workhuman, and I am grateful for the experiences and growth it has brought. 🥂I was lucky enough to work formally with both Nick and Matt. It is so clear how passionate you both are about making your pods the best they can be, and I have experienced this firsthand with both of you. 🎉Rich, I always value the insight you bring to any conversation and the camaraderie you have built on the launch team. It is truly unique and something to be appreciated. ❤️Amy, I am so grateful that I was able to work on Conversations with you this year. I have learned so much about different parts of the business and how things work. Even with unexpected changes this year, you took things in stride and focused on the future. 😊I cannot wait to see what this team will accomplish in 2025! Thank you!⭐🍻\n\n15#Top 5 Best Hospital in Massachusetts!|Upon the official signing the Executive Sponsor (Laura Flynn) said \"Terrific news. Thank you, all. I’m excited to get this project underway and to get Workhuman in place for our caregivers. It will have a truly meaningful impact on their experience here at UMass Memorial.\"  What makes this more special is I know so many of our Framingham colleagues have probably been touched by a UMass caregiver experience, now through our work we get to continue to support their tremendous work in our own communities.  22 people and probably more came together to give the UMass team the best buying experience possible and many more will carry the baton to ensure they have an equally memorable client experience.  This journey started back in 2015, selected another vendor in 2016 on price, attended WHL in 2019, came to us in 2019 and we walked away because they wouldn't engage outside of price. In 2021 they came back to us because their program was failing and they wanted to switch, but we consulted them on how to make sure they were getting the very best from the current provider and if after that they couldn't then we were here (something they appreciated and created a high level of trust), and finally they came back to us in Dec 2023 to say they were shutting their old program down and need the reboot to be a success.   There are too many folks to call out specifically, but thank you to each of you for your teamwork and dedication to our clients - each of your efforts contributed in a meaningful way to getting us here.    A special shout out to Marcy Ricci, my ride or die partner in crime, on our first new client logo on the reunion tour. And while he's not here anymore a special shout out to Mike Cassidy (aka Blue Steel) on our final swan song together.\n\n16#Bravo! to Our Ferguson Launch Team|Join me in celebrating the launch of the Ferguson Bravo! platform, which includes R&R, YOS, Automated Welcome Award and Celebrations to 32,000 employees across 5 countries in 5 languages.  Together this Ferguson Launch team navigated some tricky scenarios, ala confirming P20, delayed launch, and PM maternity leave to name a few! That said, Bravo! is live and powerful moments of gratitude are flowing to Ferguson associates.   Joyce, this launch was truly a marathon, and your expertise and customer focus made all the difference. Thank you for your incredible partnership.  Susana, thank you for establishing yourself as a trusted partner who it already to supporting them in their program growth. Matt Carlin thank you for your fantastic technical support, attention to detail, and even those last-minute updates! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.  Aidan and ihar, your branding design and implementation were absolutely fantastic and I sincerely appreciate you.  Matt Gillen, thank you for your expertise, support, and the much needed sense of humor on this launch.  Divya and Elaine, thank you for working with urgency to accommodate our client's requests.  There were many hands that helped on the TS and CL&S team and I appreciate each of you.  Bravo to this fantastic Ferugson Team!\n\n17#Dream Team|Team,  I am so grateful and proud of this team.  It takes a village but the past week has been nothing short of incredible.  Each of you have played an integral part of making 3 finalist presentations deliver an amazing experience for our possible future clients.   Michael and Orlagh - you dove in with an unexpected last minute infosec questionnaire with very little turnaround time at Entergy Amanda, Brian, and Amy - you built custom global slides, video slides, custom demo sites, posterboards and slides of custom collaterals and much more Mike, Matt, Joyce, Marcy, Eliza, Phil, Joyce, and Omar - you have been part of countless prep sessions, presenting in 3 finalist pitches in a 24 hour period, and adding so much depth to the demos and presentations.  Each of your ideas and contributions made the meetings a success.   Thank you, thank you, thank you.   We showed up well for each presentation because of each of you.\n\n18#Markel Phase 2 Launch Success|Thank you all for supporting Markel on their phase 2 launch today! Jao, you have worked on this project for the past few months and have been such a great teammate to work with. There were plenty of last minute changes and technical questions that you were able to assist with and update without any hesitation. We truly wouldn't have been able to launch today without you! Matt, thank you so much for joining all the calls with their IT and program team as they navigated the workday partner portal. You helped to put the team at ease as they updated their datafile to include the full population and joined multiple calls as we tested this. I really appreciate your support! Tina and Emily, thank you so much for helping me to run the bulk uploads for their launch day. Although we don't typically schedule the upload time you both ran this for me first thing in the morning so Markel employees could receive the launch day award at the beginning of their day. The program team is very thankful that we were able to do this for them! You all have truly helped to make an IMPACT (pun intended) for Markel!\n\n19#Spin off data file change team|Team, I wanted to thank you all for your efforts and focus on getting the National Grid data file loaded without the ESO team this week! The timeline had been laid out to start cutover activities, but a perfect storm of challenges created some delay. Things like text format, column headers, ADL and other challenges but this group pulled together and got the file loaded and the ESO launch on track! Thank you!\n\n20#YOU truly made an IM'PACT on Moody's|Celebrating the successful launch of Moody's IM’PACT platform, featuring eThanks Recognition, YOS, CEO Award, and Celebrations Bundle, now supports over 14,000 employees across 40 countries. This achievement was a true team effort, highlighted by MS Teams integration, Service Anniversary Catchup for 2023 and 2024, Experiences (Sept 26) and the World Gratitude Day Award for all.  A heartfelt thank you to everyone involved: Lauren, your dedication and engaging demos were invaluable. Katrine, your exceptional partnership and trust-building with the client shone through. Luisa and TS team, thank you for your meticulous preparation of the awards, even with last-minute updates! To the CL&S, Mobile, QA and MS Teams Integrations teams, your support and urgency in troubleshooting our client's security and other nuances was crucial in meeting our September 16 launch date.  THANK YOU, you truly made an IM'PACT :)\n\n21#Taking a Moment|On this World Gratitude Day, I want to take a moment to recognize and celebrate the incredible work you do every single day. As high-performing team, you are the driving force behind our success. Your dedication, strategic thinking, and ability to execute with precision is what keeps us moving forward, and for that, I am deeply grateful.  You handle complex challenges with grace, manage countless moving parts, and always keep your eye on delivering results. Your resilience, adaptability, and leadership have not only helped us meet our goals but have inspired those around you to strive for excellence.  Thank you for your commitment, your hard work, and your passion for making things happen. Today, we celebrate the immense value each of you bring to the team.  Let's continue to aim high, push boundaries, and achieve greatness together.\n\n22#Successful Early Q3 Review Meeting|Team, thank you for taking time to join our early Q3 review of launch successes. We had an opportunity to reflect on 9/11, celebrate some great milestones for our team members, review our wins, and improve our processes.  The team did a great job during our break out session, collaborating and thinking differently around \"The Law of triviality\".  Thank you again for your engagement and participation during our review meeting.\n\n23#Sailing off to the Sunset|Matt and Margarita,  On the call today with Gilead, celebrating the launch of Gratitude with Ashley, Lianne, and Nicole, I had a moment where I imagined you all skipping into the sunset together. It popped into my head when Nicole mentioned that she would rolling off the project along with Matt so forgive my flight of fancy. Maybe the sunset analogy is appropriate because this is the twilight period of launch. Have we ever worked with such a discerning, engaged, and detail-oriented team such as Gilead? They demanded a lot and the two of you rose to the occasion. Matt, we engaged with Gilead well over a year ago, a year that saw things like an onsite design lab, an unexpected program sponsor exit, a slight pause until the PM returned from maternity, and then it was full throttle ahead. You have been attentive at every turn, patient, informative, and maintaining their trust and sense of humor. The number of things in the past week alone - these countries are out of scope, nope, let's turn on Italy the day before - your calm reassurance brought them to the warm glow of today. Also going down as a forever memory is your comparison of certain connected links = a chocolate factory with no exit out. The Gilead team was cracking up even more than I was! Margarita, you joined the team at a pivotal time and joined right in as they were focused intently on details and getting the program to launch on time. I very much appreciate your partnership, you were visible on calls, jumping into to give accurate explanations anytime I started a sentence with \"This is where I get dangerous,\" you helped stay on top of the PM's many, many emailed questions, and were an extra set of eyes in all the ways. I feel like this will be one of the smoothest team transitions that I will be a part of because you've already established yourself as a trusted advisor. With their amazing first day metrics, this isn't a sunset, it's a sunrise on a fabulous new program. I'm grateful for you two!\n\n24#Thanks for hearing me!|Matt, I wanted to pause and thank you for the support you have shown me since joining your pod in February of this year.  Over the last two weeks a few items have come up that were truly important to me, and you have been a great listener allowing me to express not only my feelings but suggestions on what the future could look like. Thank you for validating my thoughts and moving the conversation forward. Lucky to be part of your team.\n\n25#Celebrating our Q2 Wins|Team, thank you for taking time to join our Q2 review of launch successes.  We had an opportunity to have fun, review our wins, improve our processes, and enjoy each others' company.  A review meeting is only as good as the input and energy of those attending.  That's why we always have GREAT review meetings.  This team always brings the energy and passion to our meetings and I am very grateful for that.  Thank you again and I'm looking forward to our next team get together.\n\n26#Paving the way for AI Education|A huge thank you to all the AI Ambassadors for their commitment to testing the AI education learning paths! Your time, passion, and feedback on the overall learning paths plus your ability to apply that knowledge to Microsoft Copilot have been incredibly insightful for shaping the learning paths for all employees. In addition, you have used your knowledge to learn from each other on ways Microsoft Copilot will help your teams/departments grow.   I can't wait to see the impact this group on revolutionizing the future of work!\n\n27#Payroll doc!|Team - thank you for jumping on an urgent request as we look to close Danaher down for the quarter. You are pulled in your own existing knowledge, with ways to create something that was clean, simple, and high-level for the prospect. Thank you team!\n\n28#Manhattan - A Spirited Launch Celebration!|Join me in congratulating the entire Manhattan launch team! Manhattan has launched its Spirit Program in a unique fashion with Years of Service and Quarterly 'Spirit Award' (WBAU-only) to 2545 employees in 13 countries.  We have a lot to celebrate and must take a moment to highlight some outstanding teamwork. Jenn, thank you for skillfully navigating challenging conversations around physical awards, gift cards, and tax considerations.  William, your consistent best practice guidance was invaluable. Even when the client wasn’t fully prepared for the recommended approach, you adapted and met them where they were.  Robin, your support, documentation, and voice during Workday integration were truly appreciated.  Dylan, an enormous thank you for your top-notch technical support in UAT, Production Testing, and YOS Catch-up WBAU.  Aidan and ihar, the Manhattan branding was a complete success and highlight for the client project team and other client stakeholders.  Thank you for your flexibility and patience as this launch required both.  Ruchi and Divya, thank you for your support and troubleshooting for our client.  While we navigated some challenging discussions in this launch, I consider it an amazing success that our client's SPIRIT is positive and focused on future growth.  THANK YOU TO THIS FANTASTIC TEAM!\n\n29#Workday Support!|Matt and Nick, just wanted to thank you both for providing so much support to Aptiv as we approach launched and had some challenges with getting production data. Things were coming down to the wire and this required a many internal discussions along with multiple connects with the customer. I appreciate you both joining me on some calls to troubleshoot with the Aptiv team which then led to successful datafile jobs in production. Thank you both!\n\n30#The hosts with the most|Matt and Jen, I wanted to thank you two for literally making my trip to Framingham an event. Matt, thank you for coming to the office every day, checking in on me constantly to make sure I was settled in, and planning everything regarding this trip, from meetings and important things for me to do while I am there to going through a whole project lifecycle with me to activities for me to connect and engage with the team, your leadership style is inspiring, honestly. Jen, thank you for making loads of suggestions of things I could and should do, and adding me to loads of meetings, and letting me play (with adult supervision hehe) in config to start doing my first steps, I am definitely more confident now using it. I could spend the whole day writing an essay to thank you both, and it wouldn’t be enough, but I wanted to express my gratitude.\n\n31#Questions Quest-Master|Matt - thank you SO SO much for helping me out with ATS's Manager Digest Email configuration. I really really appreciate you literally helping with everything from understanding the current Configuration all the way to helping me exclude the appropriate population asked for by the customer AND even helping me QA to ensure that ATS is kept happy. I truly truly appreciate the thoroughness to this bizarre request from them! You rock!\n\n32#Continuous Improvement|Team, thank you for all coming together through multiple sessions and iterations to help improve the presentation and flow of our Launch Project Plan in Asana.  You all helped with suggestions and execution around consolidating tasks, eliminating waste, and improving efficiency.  With this type of continuous improvement we ensure customers continue to have the best launch experience possible, while ensuring our team members new and seasoned are able to execute efficiently and confidently.\n\n33#One for the Books!|Here's to the incredible team of humans who supported our WHL breakout session scanning & line management this year in Austin!  You all stepped in and stepped up, and I cannot thank you enough for your patience, smiles, generosity and frankly keeping your calm, even when at a few sessions, it felt like people were ready to storm the room! You were all pros, from start to finish - and wow did we finish on Thursday with a bang at Cy's session. It truly looked and felt like this image above. Thank you for being kind even to those folks who we all knew were \"pulling one over on us\" (let us never give out book signing tickets again!) and for being so wonderful to me, running around with my hair on fire. And most importantly, for filling in for each other when other priorities arose - delivering a truly amazing experience for every one of our attendees, and for all your teammates. You are appreciated more than you know.\n\n34#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders.

We always want to make sure we're being clear with prospects about what to expect and you help us do that. I appreciate your quick and helpful responses to whatever I throw your way. Cheers!\n\n36#Sharing your experience|Matt, Thank you again for taking the time onsite to meet with Brendon from Charles Schwab.  WHL is such a busy time for our team but you ensured that we were able to carve out time in your schedule to meet with Brendon.  With his experience launching enterprise wide programs and yours leading mega launches I knew you'd have a great conversation and put his mind at ease that \"we got you\".  Thank you for exuding that confidence as it will help us to get to a yes down the road.\n\n37#Pulling Together for PayPal|Team, I want to express gratitude from the bottom of my heart for acting with urgency and customer focus this week as we pulled together to troubleshoot and resolve some mission-critical and time sensitive issues. Matt (squared), Brian, and Luka, thank you for helping to investigate and coordinate resolution for their Workday integration issues. Dave, thank you for sticking on late with me to try and re-load their data to refresh Production. Rich, thank you for helping me to make some crucial text updates to take down references to mobile in the site, and for looping in Kevin to help. Kevin, Aidan, and Val, thank you for all of the help in taking down the link to mobile from the homepage and making some other last-minute branding updates. Last but not least, Ger and Robert, thank you for taking the time to jump on SSO troubleshooting calls to unblock the client's launch blocker! We're so close to launch we can taste it, and this team is heavily contributing to our success!\n\n38#Asana Export|Workhuman is in a Conversations RFP process with a Protiviti, and the project plan is a required resource for decision-making. I needed help properly exporting our Conversations launch project plan from Asana. Matt, you so graciously instructed me on Slack and over Zoom. I now have the plan to share, thanks to your help!\n\n39#PayPal Payroll!|Dave, thank you so much for your hard work collaborating internally to work on applying the correct PGP key for PayPal's Workday payroll integration. They urgently need a test file produced, and we didn't realize that we didn't have the key correctly applied! You swooped in to help, and proactively logged a CL&S ticket when you discovered a weird issue blocking this update. Matt, thank you so much for being willing to jump onto a call with PayPal to help them resolve some tricky questions around the integration. They are coming right up against UAT, and the contact on their end that is doing the setup keeps coming up with unique questions! I was very head's down today, wrapping up some high priority items for another client launching on Monday, as well as finishing PayPal's sandbox configuration, but you responded right away to my request and leant the client a helping hand immediately, unblocking them and allowing testing to proceed.\n\n40#Thank you for my first week in Launch|Hey team, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize the three of you for everything you’ve done for me in such a short period of time. Kat, your willingness to talk to me about the team and the Launch Success Manager role was crucial. Without that conversation, I might not have applied, and I’m incredibly grateful for the day I reached out to you on Slack. Your passion and excitement about the role convinced me to apply, and here I am, a couple of months later.  Jen, my shadowing buddy in Allianz, thank you for your patience. You always take things slow when I’m watching, giving me space to ask questions. Your kind replies and willingness to go over processes repeatedly until they make sense in my head have been invaluable. You’ve also encouraged me to find my own style in how I approach each process, which has been fantastic. It’s been an amazing experience shadowing your work at Allianz.  And Matt, you’re an outstanding leader. From our first interaction during the interview process, I knew I’d love to work with you. My gut feeling was right! You motivate me, understand my perfectionism, and remind me that it’s okay not to get things fully right on the first attempt. Your regular check-ins and acknowledgment of my progress mean a lot. Thank you for being so supportive as I learn how to walk—I hope to be running soon, and maybe one day, even flying! 🚀✨\n\n41#Leveling up the Launch Team|Matt, I want to thank you for your continued efforts to ensure all Launch Managers are prepared and empowered to lead Workday API conversations with customers.  You were first to lead the charge when this became a new responsibility, honed talking points and supporting assets.  Now you are diving deeper into FAQs and other assets, so that our team is fully supported as they continue to be the point person for all things launch.\n\n42#Bundles of Celebration for Hyland!|Thank you to the amazing team that delivered Hyland's new YOS and Celebration configuration across the finish line.  Hyland is live in 26 countries with monetary YOS and a nonmonetary automated Welcome Award.  All other Service Milestones, Life Events, and Community Celebrations awards will be live on April 1 to coordinate with internal communications.  At first, Hyland was unsure if they could go-live with the full Celebration Bundle on April 1.  It was the trust, confidence, and expertise of this team that movitated Hyland to say ''YES' to celebrating their humans in the Hylight platform now and not later.  Aidan and ihar, your design and implementation was spot on with immediate positive feedback from our client.  Luisa, your diligence and partnership in technical configuration and troubleshooting is stellar.  Alex, the relationship and trust you have established with Hyland was the cornerstone of this expansion project.  THANK YOU to this entire team!\n\n43#2024 Launch Team Offsite|Team, thank you all for an incredible 2024 Launch Team Offsite.  We took the time to celebrate our wins in 2023, had fun learning about other areas of the business, playing \"Deal or No Deal\" and \"Fact or Fiction\".  We had fun and learned a lot from Judy and Chuck, and to had time to focus in on process improvements around Workday, hosted by Matt Gillen and communicating effectively, hosted by Nick Eng.  Most importantly you were present, thoughtful and engaged.  As we continue through 2024 with our focus on the Strategy Board, we all play a part in achieving our goals.  I'm very excited as to see what 2024 brings for each and everyone of you.\n\n44#Outstanding Team Collaboration|Expressing the sheer incredibility of our team is quite a challenge. Each day, you all manage to astound me. A massive shoutout to Matt Gillen, Nick Eng, and every single one of you for offering exceptional support to our team. Your collaboration is truly outstanding and immensely valued. Thank you all for dedicating your time to collaborate last week - you guys truly rock! Rich, thanks for being my Boston buddy!\n\n45#Platform & Program Power|Matt,  Thank you so much for jumping in to help Maggie and I earlier today.  We have a client that we are looking to get over the finish line and you helped us ensure that what we were offering to do would work for them.  You provided great examples of how we've been there, done that and even offered to jump on with the client.  This type of collaboration is so vital to ensure we are setting them up for success.  Looking forward to partnering again in the future and thank you for sharing your wisdom.\n\n46#Team Rio Makes a Difference Today|We did it! RockStars is live! What a fantastic culmination of this team’s effort over the past 7 months. Putting aside the challenge of it, today is what matters, when the thing we worked so hard on together starts delivering the impact we know it’s capable of. We’ve been saying, “It’s all gonna be great when it’s live.” And it is. After a project when positivity felt hard to come by, today is nothing but.   James, your Exec Sponsor relationship mattered more than in any launch I’ve seen before. Thank you for handling the hard bits with trust and professionalism. Glenn, thank you for your early and dedicated investment in RockStars’ success. You’ve shown Rio the full measure of what it feels like to be our customer. Jose, it was inspiring and humbling to watch you in action on this project. You are an incredible leader. Thank you for doing the right thing for the business at every turn. Rich, your keen sense for what to communicate when made such a difference in pivotal moments and served as powerful lessons for me. Matt C., what a test of, and testament to, your resilience. Your troubleshooting, organization, responsiveness, and good nature got us over the finish line. Matt G., you missed exactly zero beats stepping in. Transitions are delicate but your tech and PM chops gave Rio full trust in you. Dinorah, you invested the most off-hours meeting time in a launch, ever. For your customer focus and relentlessness in pointing them to strategic decisions, thank you.  Together, we delivered some groundbreaking stuff in one of the most complex launches in our history. In existential moments about my life choices, I thought about the miners in Guinea, doing dangerous jobs, who don’t read or write, who go home to spotty electricity and running water. It might not be overstating it to say we’ve brought \"I am valued\" feelings to people who need it most. A proud day, Team Rio. Congratulations!\n\n47#STERIS Celebrates YOU!|AN ENOURMOUS THANK YOU to the entire team that supported the launch of STERIS Celebrates program! STERIS launched in unique fashion to ~ 6000 WBAU recipients across 43 countries, setting the stage for their April 1 FY25 'Full Launch' to include YOS, Celebrations, and eThanks. THANK YOU for helping STERIS make this important first step towards infusing their culture with gratitude and celebration.  Mary-Liz, your unwavering commitment to STERIS and your skillful guidance in Comms and Strategy truly stood out.  When STERIS opted for unique first phase of launch in a 'Redemption Only' state, you gracefully pivoted and continued to support them with the same level of professionalism and enthusiasm. Meaghan, your partnership on this launch has been skillful and steadfast, lending your reporting expertise throughout.  The trust you've already built with the STERIS project team is evident. Jonathan, thank you for your technical support and expertise and for prepping and staging the launch day WBAU and the follow up files! Cliona and ihar,  thank you for delighting STERIS with their 'beautiful and clean' site branding.  Aliaksandr, my sincere gratitude for the 'double' QA on this launch! To the CL&S team, thank you for your tremendous contributions and coordination throughout.  CONGRATULATIONS to the entire team who contributed to and supported this launch!\n\n48#Coverage while I start a new chapter|Matt, I can't thank you enough for covering my clients while I was away on paternity leave.  You gave me the power to be fully present with my newly expanded family.  Going into leave, I understood the lift ahead.   Given where the clients sat from a relationship perspective and within the launch timeline, I knew this was no small ask, but I was handing them to someone who would meet the challenge.  End of the year, QA's, UAT's, production pushes are some of the most crucial steps in the project as you know.  I felt confident that I would be coming back to many of these milestones checked off with flying colors. This is with all the other tasks necessary to being a team lead.  We can't thank you enough. I thank you and my family thanks you.\n\n49#That was fast!!|Matt, thanks a million for getting some updates pushed out to ATS so I could record their training before I leave for Activate. This timing was critical because I didn't really want to record at the end of a long day next week. You made quite a few updates, re-ran a data file, and also cleared up some things with the customer. I appreciate your sense of urgency! The training video has been completed...thanks to you!!!\n\n50#Arkansas Children's Awesome Launch Team!|Let's Celebrate the Arkansas Children's launch including R&R, YOS, and the Celebrations Bundle to over 6000 dedicated employees.  This launch was a true team effort with MS Teams & Outlook Integrations, recurring Wellness Points WBAUs, Gratitude Summit and more.  The Arkansas Children's Awards Feed is flooded with heartwarming and authentic moments of gratitude.  THANK YOU to every awesome member of this team that made this launch possible!\n\n51#Keeping Rio Tinto moving in the right direction|It may seem like an impossible task, taking over a launch for a teammate, especially as one as complex as Rio Tinto is.  And just like in their mining operation, pulling minerals out of the earth doesn't happen with a magic wand, getting a customer to be launch ready isn't done with a magic wand either.  It takes, conviction, determination, resiliency and grace, which you have demonstrated as we near the incredibly important milestone of UAT sign off.  As I look at the shear size of this Cat 793F mining truck in the image here, I ask myself how is it humanly possible to build, operate and maintain such an enormous thing.  I am also reminded that this vehicle exists and does work. Therefore regardless how \"big\" a project or customer may seem, we should all rest assure that it is possible, it can be done, and together we make that happen.  I thank you for your efforts to get us here!\n\n52#Excellent feedback from ATS|Hi Matt, Congratulations on the AWESOME feedback from ATS. It's your 2nd week covering for Matt C's paternity leave and you're already making an impression. On today's call, the Exec Sponsor said \"you are meeting and exceeding my expectations. Anyone would be lucky to have you on their launch. You have made this SEAMLESS. This customer has been in launch for a year now due to their own timelines and it's nice to see them reacting so positively during the home stretch! Congrats on this customer feedback.\n\n53#Celebrate! the MUSC Launch Team!|AN ENOURMOUS THANK YOU to the entire team that supported the Medical University of South Carolina's Launch!  MUSC launched Celebrate! with Plateau YOS, Celebrations Bundle and R&R set for Spring 2024 to over 20,000 employees and healthcare providers.  MUSC will celebrate its Bicentennial next year and needed a strategic recognition partner who would respect their 200-year traditions  while deepening their culture of gratitude and community.  Lisa, thank you for the awesome relationship you built with MUSC as well as the critical coordination efforts with our WH eCommerce team.  Dinorah, I am grateful for the strategy and care you provided MUSC, flexing to meet their communication/training needs on this quick launch.  Aidan and ihar, a tremendous thank you for your skill and hard work in meeting a tight timeline. Dylan, thank you for your thoughtful technical support and UAT prep.  To the Integrations and CL&S team members that supported this launch, thank you for your partnership and patience in troubleshooting and executing on SSO, WD API, MS Teams Integration and more.  CONGRATULATIONS to the entire team who contributed to and supported this launch!\n\n54#Gilead Team Work|Matt and Joyce-thank you for answering what might be a thousand questions about Gilead for my SCD presentation. I appreciate you both taking the time to date and in the future!\n\n55#Synchrony STARS relaunch is full speed ahead!|Tony, Matt, Brittany, and Dan - thank you for all being engaged, informative, flexible, and driven on today's call with Synchrony! You can see the excitement in Alison's eyes and hear it in her voice. She is all in for the relaunch of Synchrony STARS, adding in Celebrations, changing all of their Award Reasons to align with their Values, refreshing their look, and all the other goodies they are adding in. I feel confident we are creating something very special for Synchrony. Thank you!\n\n56#Workday Data Hero|Thank you, Matt for jumping in to help out with Applied Materials Workday data file. After your assistance we were able to unblock SSO sandbox testing and successfully load in a data file into config for this client. The client and I were both thrilled to have you on the call on Monday! Great work!\n\n57#Q3 Review|Team, I can't thank you all enough for coming to our Q3 review meeting with such amazing energy!  The participation was great and I hope everyone enjoyed playing our \"Please let me in ...\" game.  From impersonating a plumber, throwing rocks at the windows, teleporting or riding a horse through a field.  You all thought creatively when it came to solving the problem.  I'm also excited to see everyone taking on the new enhanced huddle postings with such enthusiasm.  This team is ever present and constantly striving for improvement.  Thank you for being authentic selves in our meetings and everyday.\n\n58#Creating the new possible at Gilead!|Gilead Team - Thank you very much for the thoughtful, consultative design lab you put together. They've had a few different project team challenges and we know this is a sizeable change management effort. This teams ability to listen first, ask questions, and then assure the client was outstanding. The team did such a wonderful job, our executive sponsor who was only scheduled to stay for 30-minutes, ended up spending the entire day with us. It is a true testament your ability to bring value and excitement to this initiative.  I cannot wait to see where you take this client! Thank you all again!\n\n59#Crushing our Launch Workshop|Team, I want to thank you for clearly coming prepared for our Workshop this week.  We all came together to practice presenting our launches, as if we were attending an All Hands Meeting.  These meetings are generally packed with exciting speakers and information, therefore when we get an opportunity to present, we must be tight, efficient and deliver on educating others.  Everyone did a fantastic job.\n\n60#Basis Workday Afficionado!|Thank you so much for all of the work you've done to help Basis hit the ground running with their Workday setup. From participating in the initial call, to jumping on several more calls to answer questions, you have been a huge support every step of the way. You've also answered my millions of questions in an effort to train me up for future Workday clients. I've learned so much from your insights and listening to you on these calls. The knowledge I've gained from your insights to my millions of questions, and listening to you on these calls will help so much as I work with future Workday clients. Thanks for partnering up with me on this one!\n\n61#Dynamic Duo|As we celebrate World Gratitude Day, I reflect on just how fortunate I am to be working with both of you.  You each bring a different perspective to all our discussions.  You compliment each other like \"lamb and tuna fish\", or maybe you like the analogy of \"spaghetti and meatballs\" better!  Either way, working with you both has made me a better manager and a better person.  There is no obstacle or challenge that we can't tackle together.\n\n62#Continuing the Continuity Plan|Matt, each year you have spearheaded the review of the Customer Success' Business Impact Analysis (BIA). Which is a part of the contingency planning process for the Customer Success department.  This annual review is important to the business, while it is behind the scenes type of work, it is no less important or impactful than when you launch customers or coach teammates.  Thank you for doing the extra, the work that doesn't fall under one's \"job description\".  This is important work and thank you for taking it on.\n\n63#Save to faves!|Matt! Kudos to you on Flutter launch! My favourite thing about this being my very favourite launch ever - was that it was yours too! However you spell it the sentiment is the same - and truly that’s been influenced by the amazing relationship and partnership you fostered with Vlad, Katinka and the wider Flutter team. You could tell they found you a true delight to work with and not only valued your expertise and support but genuinely enjoyed and appreciated our meetings and your guidance throughout.  They mentioned that Workhuman were excellent partners and that your weekly meeting was the favourite of the week and that's a credit to you! 3 different programs (Cluj added in in the final stretch!!), nearly 6000 employees in 17 countries all launched successfully with incredibly encouraging engagement and activity in the first few days! If I was a gambling woman I'd put money on Flutter kudos continuing to be an amazing success - enabling engagement and a culture of recognition and consistency across Group Functions and Flutter international - and that's a credit to you! When it comes to launch successes I hope you save this one to your favourites!\n\n64#Flutter giving Kudos|Here is some great feedback from Vlad (Director, Executive Compensation and Share Incentives):  \"... Kudos programme is now live in both Group Functions and International division.  It was a very lengthy project (the RFP was underway in Aug last year!). Lots of things were thrown at us in terms of requirements, contractual clauses, etc. Nevertheless, we delivered! Together!   It was a privilege to work with you both on this project and am very proud of what we achieved.  I do not have the possibility of giving you an award to show my appreciation, however I am hoping this can be sorted internally using Workhuman’s own recognition programme.  Appreciate all the support you have given me throughout these months.\n\n65#Holdin' it down for EMC|Matt - THANK YOU for your impressive work to ensure EMC's managers could give recognition even if they didn't have a direct report listed in their data file. This issue has been going on for a while, but you jumped right in to save the day and get it sorted. Clarissa seems very happy with the progress and I am excited for this functionality to launch! All while we are in RFP with this customer, too. You have made a big impact on this relationship through your cool, calm, collected work and I hope you know how much it is appreciated! YOU GO, GLEN COCO!\n\n66#(re)Energizing Baker Hughes Strategic Recognition!|Congratulations and THANK YOU to Team Baker Hughes who (re)Launched their monetary Recognition Program to 56,580 employees in 96 Countries.  This (re)Launch is proof that the path to success is not always a straight line!  Our core client-facing team was steadfast in providing best practice guidance while meeting the client where they were, pivoting, and then pivoting again.  Suzanne, it was a treat collaborating and problem solving with you to best serve our client.  You expertly weighed in, when needed, providing the consistency and partnership BH needs and deserves while also supporting the RFP finalist presentation.  Shelly, WOW.  BH went from saying 'no' to almost all training and communications to saying 'YES' to 4 gratitude vignettes and a Gratitude Summit.  You sprung into action to deliver absolutely AMAZING vignettes also while assisting in the RFP finalist presentation!  Erika, thank you for lending support to this launch while driving forward on RFP details and finalist presentation preparation.  Luisa, your technical support is thoughtful, detailed, proactive, and collaborative - its just fantastic to work with you. TS, CL&S, and QA thank you for your tremendous support throughout this project.  Together we have solidified our foundation and partnership with Baker Hughes.  CONGRATULATIONS to the entire team for reaching this important milestone!\n\n67#Launch Team Q2 Review Meeting|I want to thank everyone for coming prepared and fully invested into our launch team Q2 review meeting.  These meetings are successful because of everyone's participation.  Whether you attended in person, remotely, or by providing email feedback in advance due to being on site for a customer launch!  This team is dedicated to delivering an exceptional experience for our customers and it shows during these meetings where we laugh, learn and reflect.  The best part was learning that one LSM has never had ice cream on top of their cake.\n\n68#Recognizing (re)LAUNCH Excellence!|A SPECIAL THANK YOU to the entire (re)LAUNCH team for Sotera Health's Recognizing Excellence Program! Sotera Health relaunched to 3151 employees across 13 countries in 12 languages, adding monetary recognition and celebrations bundle with the goal of boosting gratitude and connectivity and improving internal process efficiency in payroll and monetary recognition.  Please join me in congratulating the amazing team that made this possible.  William, you were strategic, empathetic, and flexible all while leading Manager and HR trainings with nothing but positive feedback!  Adam, your technical expertise was efficient, helpful, and collaborative as we navigated custom SOLI, UAT, translations, and payroll file updates.  Luka, it's been a pleasure to partner with you in simplifying Sotera's payroll file approach, solving a major client pain point as well effectively delivering 2 custom approval rules.  Aidan and ihar, your branding updates are beautiful and energizing!  Matt, your behind the scenes guidance, client-facing finesse, and stellar screenshot abilities are unmatched.  THANK YOU to everyone that made this (re)launch a success!\n\n69#To an incredible job well done!|WOW! What an incredible customer panel at WHL Regional forum in London!  It was an amazing endorsement of our platform, experience and results!  Both BP and Sanofi could not have been more positive and complimentary about Workhuman’s recognition program at each of their companies and it’s a testament to just how dedicated, professional and willing to go above and beyond each of you are to deliver this superior customer experience.  You just don’t hear this kind of resounding endorsement about other software vendors – in fact, Nathalie at BP even corrected herself from calling us a vendor, changing her word choice to partner!  So many of you were personally shouted out from the main stage and you all have had a critical role to play in making these customers true advocated and sponsors of Workhuman.  THANK YOU for all you do for BP, Sanofi and so many more of our key customers!!\n\n70#Brain Trust|This is long overdue as I wanted to thank each of you for your support you’ve provided me over the last little while, including last week. The support varies from crafting training materials, backend testing, demos, project support, managing customer responses and calls, validation on configuration/data files/my knowledge and escalation coverage. Your combined support has provided confidence in the support Workhuman is providing to our customers and continuing their trust in us. Thank you for allowing me to tap into this brain trust and I appreciate each of you!\n\n71#Bravo! to you on the global Sanofi launch|Bravo! on the launch of Sanofi's new program to 81,000 employees globally. YAAYY  I want to say a huge thank you and congratulations to you all for your work on the Sanofi Bravo! launch. This launch took tremendous teamwork and collaboration across this group. Kat, well done on leading the Sanofi launch project, this hasn't been easy one due to the multiple last minute  (and difficult) client requests along the way, you did a great job managing these with internal teams and building great relationship with the client program team. Lynette, well done on guiding Sanofi's strategy and change management for their new global program and the relationship building you have done along the way with the core and wider teams at Sanofi. Joyce and Ashley fantastic work the Bravo! launch communications, it was great to see those come to life on the launch day. Jose, Matt, Emily and Alex, thanks for your collaboration and support with multiple requests along the way, both with internal teams and externally with the client. Adam, Stephen, Chaslau, Maksim, Ruchi and Aiden for the run up to launch with invoicing set-up and launch day support, datafile requests and working on last min eligibility rules, SOLI reviews and branding tweaks. Chris, Kevin, Connor, Julia, Emily, Hillary, Jennie, thanks for your work on the Sanofi finance and amendment requests, the FX queries, custom invoicing, and the CIL set-up. I appreciate there has been a lot of meetings and work both internally and externally to support these, thank you all for your work to get us here. On launch day there was great excitement generated with site celebrations, balloons, cupcakes and selfie boots at the launch events, we received really positive feedback from the program team and Sanofi employees. Huge congrats and thank you to you all again for your contributions to this client launch.\n\n72#The Final Count Down for Associated Materials|What an amazing group of Humans that helped come together in the final hours to get Associated Materials across the finish line!  This group was able to remove obstacles and keep things from derailing. Over the last two weeks we have had to update the program email address more than once, which required a deep understanding of prior and new configuration requirements. Make changes to the homepage two days before launch. Finally get the complex years of service catch up awards processed. Appreciate the support from this team to keep our customer happy.\n\n73##BigRocksBigResults -Module #3 -Class of May 2023|💡 “Whatever you are not changing, you are choosing\".

THANK YOU from the bottom of my soul. Many of you lived through the \"challenges\" we experienced last year, and for those who didn't you heard about it, so you new the nerves were running high. Clearly working technology is always a huge help, but that's just the ticket for entry.  It's all of you who kept the flow of attendees happy, directing them to the right spots, giving them a smile and a feeling that you were there just for them. Honestly...Walmart has nothing on this team! I'm so incredibly grateful for all of your support, even when you weren't scheduled so many of you jumped in to help as needed.  Simply the best!!!\n\n77#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.  Your efforts created an unforgettable experience for over 1,500 attendees and reconfirmed our event as the world's leading HR conference.  Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention. Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n78#Bravo! to Sanofi's Launch Team!|Team, congratulations and thank you all for the super hard work done for the North American launch of Sanofi's Bravo! program. This was a challenging one from the start, with a hard launch date for North America and competing priorities and misconceptions galore within Sanofi. This team rose to the occasion at every turn, whether directly client-facing or not, and got this big, complex Phase 1 launch across the finish line on time, with 95 days from contract to launch. Lynette and Joyce, you led the way on a lot of the strategy, and certainly with communications and change management, making sure to satisfy the needs of both the North American and Global populations. With Ashley supporting from an aesthetic perspective, it's no wonder Sanofi are pleased with how their launch campaign turned out! Speaking of aesthetics, Aidan and Ihar, you both worked so hard to satisfy this client's requirements and executed a beautiful design for the Bravo! site! Emily, Alex, Tracey, and Jose, we very much appreciate the support and internal information gathering that you all did throughout this phase. Adam, Luka, Johnny, Yauhen, from a TS/CLS perspective, I'm sure you'll all be happy to see a break in incoming Sanofi tickets, but please know that this phase would not have been a success without your timely responses to my emergency escalations! Last but absolutely not least, Matt, you were an amazing co-lead on this launch. You backed me up on calls with the client, took initiative to handle some things on your own when I ran out of time due to fast and furious Sanofi requests, and even supported me emotionally through the last 2 weeks before launch, when things were looking dire and I was super stressed. You helped me think of creative solutions and/or messaging for some truly sticky wickets over the last 3 months. While we still have a little bit to go on Phase 2 of this launch, the bulk of the work is behind us; BRAVO! to this entire team!!!\n\n79#RFP Mobilisation|Matt, thank you helping with \"mobilisation\" (aka project plan) RFP this week.  Sometimes we are tapped on the shoulder to work on projects that are not in our everyday tasks.  You always take on unique and time sensitive projects and deliver before the deadline.  Thank you for continuing to help out where needed!\n\n80#Top Trainers|I wanted to thank you both for taking time to give the team training on SSO and Payroll files. The training may have been an hour but I know there is more involved in preparing for these sessions. And as we all know, there is plenty of other work as part of your roles that would be waiting for you after this. I know for me, both sessions were a great eye opener. Until now I would only be able to talk at a very general level for both of these topics but I now feel more confident to speak about these and having both sessions recorded I feel these will be invaluable resources for the team going forward\n\n81#Uniting for Sanofi's Onsite UAT|Sanofi's launch has been primarily managed by their Global team, based out of France, but they're launching initially just to their North America populations in early April. To make the NA team feel the love, the WH launch team accepted their invitation to do an onsite UAT this week in New Jersey. THE CHALLENGE: As of mid-week last week, the data file wasn't running smoothly, branding wasn't approved, and there were multiple kinks with the site causing major issues that would prevent the Sanofi team from performing their testing. THE ACTION: I am in awe, truly, of how this entire team united to troubleshoot urgent issues, working together to do out utmost to get as much finished in time for Monday as possible. Luka, Johnny, and Rati, you all jumped in and prioritized requests for data transformation rules, and fixed a huge cloning issue that was causing massive downstream problems. Adam, you keep everything tight on the TS configuration side, helping to get our last few items, like Recognition Intelligence, in so that we could go into UAT knowing that the client would get the full experience. Aidan, you genuinely put the client first on this one, working super hard to meet the client's tricky branding requirements and turn things around at lightning speed. Ihar, you took an agile approach to the branding config, making sure that as much as possible made it in for UAT. Joyce, Lynette, and Matt, the three of you are superstar partners, particularly last week, taking on a lot of overflow tasks and last-minute requests. THE RESULT: Sanofi's onsite UAT kickoff session was wildly successful, thanks to the combined efforts of this whole team. Sanofi testers were very engaged and pleasantly surprised with their program's smooth and intuitive design/functionality, and grateful to have the WH team collaborating with them in person. This is a prime example of the WH team's ability to pivot when necessary and rise to the occasion to satisfy our important clients.\n\n82#Friends, Sanofians, Countrymen, lend me your ears|Kat and Mat, our recent onsite visit to Sanofi to connect with their North American team, conduct a UAT session, and guide them to some decisions made me think of this quote.  Apparently, this is a Shakespearean quote that has Antony speaking at Julius Caesar’s funeral and the next line is \"I've come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\" Bear with me for this stretch of an analogy! We went to Bridgewater to help Sanofi NA bury their old recognition program and Kat, you were our orator, commanding the room and skillfully navigating them through the test scripts and a multitude of other agenda topics such as post-launch support, admin reporting, additional programs and data privacy. Matt, you were that steady guiding force in the room, peppering in both jokes and clarifying remarks, jumping up to offer assistance, and covering a high-visibility Chanel call while onsite so Kat could focus on Sanofi. While it may not be Shakespeare, this quote is also attributed to Caesar: \"I came, I saw, I conquered\". There is magic in connecting with clients in person, and you made the most of the face-time with this group to ensure we're on track for early April launch with the NA population. I'm proud to be a part of team purple with you!\n\n83#2023 Launch Team Offsite|Team, I can not thank you enough for bringing your wholeself to our Launch Team Offsite, coming right off the heels of Activate.  Everyone did such a great job participating and leaning into each and every topic.  As a group we were able to launch 66 brand new customers, averaging 172 days from contract to launch in 2022.  We had great guest speakers and every one of you ensured your voice was heard in each session.  I'm very excited to see what 2023 bring to this team.  Thank you for being authentic, thoughtful and involved!\n\n84#Rising to the Chanel Challenge|A massive thank you goes out to this entire team for all of the hard work over the past weeks in preparing for the onsite Chanel design lab that took place in NYC this week. This group got together and showed up both strong and on-brand, rising to the multiple challenges that Chanel set for us, resulting in a very unique, yet productive, day! Naomi and James, you both worked so hard to share background and historical insights from the sales cycle, ensuring that the launch team understood the nature of working with this client. Emily, you jumped in and fully supported me when logistics started to go astray at the last possible second, and we ended up pulling off the dinner event with your help. Sarah, you were an amazing partner, and pivoted away from your normal process to allow the Chanel team the space they wanted to discuss their iconic brand and how that will translate into their Merci program during your breakout. Joyce, Bryan, and Matt, you were the rockstars of the day, leading and supporting all of the sessions with warmth and professionalism. Joyce, though the Chanel team threw you some curveballs during one of the breakout sessions, you reeled them back in and kept focus on the objectives of the day. Bryan, you contributed some great context throughout the day, and kept us all on time through the breakout readouts during the wrap-up. Matt, you made sure to provide some best practice recommendations and used some anecdotes that really hit home to the Chanel team. Aside from the work stuff, it was great travelling to NYC with you all. We had a lot of fun together, from a team dinner the night before, to funky bagels for breakfast, and beyond. Here's to continuing this collaboration as we head into the rest of the launch!\n\n85#Esteemed customer shout outs|I was blown away by the content of our Customer Panel at Activate and was most struck by the genuine and heartfelt shout outs that just kept coming from Emblem Health, Pfizer and Zimmer Bionet.  Hearing you all called out for your amazing work with these customers with quotes like “he remained completely calm”, “the transparency is what did it for me” and “this was the most successful program implementation in the company’s 130 year history” was such a resounding endorsement for the professionalism, the sophistication and the polish you bring to your work and to our customers every day.  Matt, Mike, Aaron, Annemarie, Alex, Mike, Lauren – thank you for the work you have done and are continuing to do to support our customers from prospect, to launch, and then straight on through to successful growth of their programs.  Jen – you were a poised and very natural panel host, navigating the questions and steering the discussion like a pro.  The panel was a huge success. We learned a lot that can be taken to other customers but the highlight was seeing the incredible relationships you all have built with our customers on behalf of Workhuman.  A true success story in its own right – thank you!\n\n86#OOO Coverage|Thank you Matt for all your help while I was away.  As you know, leading up to a launch can bring about many last minute questions and changes which you handled with calm urgency and thoroughness. As I read through the emails from the client, you kept them up to date on progress while researching unique asks and acting quickly to assure a successful launch.  With the other clients, you were willing to take calls and help them navigate outstanding asks which helps grow the relationship further.  Thank you for all your help!\n\n87#BRAVO! For Our Seat at Sysco's Table|I must take a moment to thank the fantastic launch team that supported Sysco as it launched with eThanks and Community Celebrations to ~57,000 employees in 11 Countries across the globe!  This cross-functional team served double duty as we drove toward a successful January launch while supporting Sysco's project team in securing funding for next fiscal year.  Dinorah, you served as a trusted guide and advocate navigating multiple pivots while leading some uber-attended trainings (1880 attendees total!).  Ally, you've established yourself as a trusted resource by stepping in and up in all the right moments.  Brittany, thank you for partnership with all things Community Celebrations, WBAU, UAT and more!  Branding Team, I am continuously impressed - Sarah, thank you for leading us through Sysco's branding process with efficiency and quality.  Cliona, Aidan and ihar thank for tending to all the little details, many aimed at offline employee experience/mobile app. To the CL&S Team, THANK YOU!  Your support has been top notch throughout launch, including help this week with so many other things going on.  BRAVO! to the entire Sysco Launch Team - your partnership and dedication has earned Workhuman a seat at Sysco's Table.\n\n88#Budgeting Bosses|Rich, Matt, and Erin, thank you all for the help in crafting some budget/spend management options for Sanofi. This client has come into launch with some fears around spend and budgeting, and expressed a strong desire for partnership from Workhuman during the Design Lab. You've all jumped in to help me meet this request, spending time talking through different pros, cons, and options, as well as the best way to handle some of the objections that we anticipate will arise. I appreciate the teamwork on this!\n\n89#\"The best implementation and launch\"|Lauren and Matt, I just spent 30 min with Andrea at Zimmer learning about her recognition journey and the success they've had with Ignite in prep for interviewing her on a panel for Activate next month and she gave such glowing praise for how you two helped her that I have to amplify your work: \"Lauren and Matt set the bar high\" \"so clean, crisp, kept us on track, and we had an aggressive target\"  She said you two could create your own consulting team teaching other vendors how to implement! She said Workhuman is now the bar that all other vendors have to meet when it comes to implementation and launch.  She also shared two other stories with me that I want to pass along: Matt, she really appreciated how you kept her calm in the storm when everything was ready to launch, then the CEO wanted to change their promises...a highly stressful moment in the process where you kept her calm, offered ideas and instilled confidence. Lauren, she recently had her first podcast interview with David Rock, and to hear you listened to it, and reached out when it aired, she was very touched.    Thank you both for being stellar examples of Customer Excellence. My face hurts from smiling so big and wide. It was a pleasure hearing her dole out praise and speak so highly of your teamwork, professionalism, expertise and knowledge.\n\n90#Quality QA-ers!|Team, thank you all so much for the hard work that you've put in over the past few weeks making sure that the new Launch Success Hub pages are functioning properly and have the correct tone, context, and content! Each of these pages is text and link heavy, and you all jumped right in, suggesting edits and working through questions and issues with me. The next stage in launch documentation wouldn't be happening without your amazing contributions. I appreciate all you!\n\n91#You're the reason Ochsner is celebrating!|Congratulations to the Ochsner Launch Team on a successful and heartening launch!  The Ochsner PM said that it felt that Christmas Eve the on the Eve of their Ovations Launch to their 32,000 caregivers and employees that help change and save lives every day.  We met Ochsner employees 'where they work' by launching successfully with MS Teams and Outlook integrations.  Dinorah, your approach was knowledgeable, client-focused, and flexible as we continuously navigated twists and turns from our client AND all the while delivering successful trainings! John, you leaned into this launch from day one, offering a supportive and confident voice to our technical/product conversations. Brenda, your seasoned, natural delivery in front of the client (when called upon) is a pleasure to witness and absorb.  Brittany, THANK YOU - I appreciate your positive approach in your technical support and your expertise was crucial on this Celebrations launch. Jenn, thank you for your commitment to shadowing this launch as your engagement and positive energy throughout.  Beth and Lisa, thank you for bringing Ochsner to WH and for the continued collaboration.  Dan Fiore, a huge thank you - Ochsner required troubleshooting that ultimately ended in a shared celebration and bonding between the Ochsner and WH teams.  Laura, your ability to keep the Ochsner team focused on a VERY tight branding timeline was impressive and your design was a delightful slam dunk!  Ihar thank you for make the Ochsner branding come to life with all your beautiful finishing touches. Johnny Grant, thank you for your support of this launch in all ways, including a 'trickier than expected' custom approval rule and a last minute change request.  Hillary and team, thank you for your quick and decisive responses to Ochsner's payroll team- well done! A huge thank you to CS&L and QA team members, we could not have made this happen without your expertise!  THANK YOU to this amazing Ochsner launch team!  Congratulations!\n\n92#First PLS is in the books|Matt, as the first recipient of the post launch survey, I wanted to pause and congratulate you on providing a fantastic launch experience for Convatec! A glowing overall launch experience score of 4.5 out of 5 from 2 members of the program team! It is a team effort and it was commented our team worked together very well. It is the specific call out to you, I wanted to highlight – “Matt's organization and PM skills are excellent. The materials your team provided were also helpful. Lastly, it was great to work with a team who is already experienced with launching the platform across multiple geographies.” Thank you for starting our partnership with Convatec positively with your experience and leadership. Congratulations!\n\n93#JW Partner in Crime!|Matt - long overdue acknowledgement of how much I have appreciated your partnership on JW. You came into this extended launch period and have been a saving grace keeping track of all the changes they are still making, keeping us on track to Jan 3rd, and have been such a solid resource for me...and more so for them!  From award advisor reconfigs, program name changes and changes back and forth, and many many test payroll files. We would be lost without you.\n\n94#Delivering Excellence|Jen, Matt, and Nick, thank you for providing commentary and demos of your recent launches to the Customer Marketing group.  Each of you represented Launch, showing internal stakeholders just how awesome a team we are.  Everyone delivered tight summaries and demos staying on time and/or finishing early.  You clearly knew your customer and understood your audience.  Thank you for showing others just how great a team we are.\n\n95#Thank you Ipsen Launch Team!|CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU to the amazing team that contributed to the Ipsen to launch!  My journey on this project began after many thoughtful and detailed conversations with Ipsen had already taken place.  Thank you for Alex, Emily, Naomi, and Jen for providing important intel, guidance, and support for our in-person HRLT meeting in the Ipsen Cambridge office this past June.  Alex, a special thank you for your continued support throughout launch.  Orlagh your data privacy and security expertise was woven throughout pre-contract and implementation - thank you for your quick turnaround time and transparency with our European client.  Our Ipsen journey has been a 'labor of love' for our core launch team.  Matt Gillen, thank you for your support and guidance in all things launch strategy and more.  Joyce and Mary-Liz, you are truly the A-Team of Consulting, Training, and Communications, often fielding questions that WH's most seasoned colleagues have not encountered while flexing to provide recorded and in-person demos often with limited notice.  Guilherme, your support of our SOLI and reporting conversations was critical in instilling confidence and partnership throughout launch process.  Dan Fiore, thank you for your patience and expertise in supporting Ipsen in their continued Workday Integration conversations and detailed SOLI discussions.   Brittany, an overdue THANK YOU for your sense of urgency and skill in meeting our client's timeline for all necessary launch checklist items and more.  A huge shout out to Robert McArdle, Johnny Grant, Luka Crljen, Gerard MacDonald, Rahul Bagave in Production Support for helping deliver a successful implementation with many time-sensitive requests and oh so many PGP keys and payroll files.  Cliona, your flexibility and skill never cease to amaze me - a beautiful job with Bravo! branding with many requests and tight timeline.  Bravo! to the Ipsen launch team in helping shepherd Ipsen in building a culture of gratitude.\n\n96#Celebrating Bravery & Unfiltered Feedback|Launch team, I wanted to thank you all for your courage and authenticity during our recent round of project management process interviews, in preparation for the upcoming Asana rollout. Having dedicated time to talk through each of your feelings and ideas for the next generation of launch individually was such a gift. While it may have felt uncomfortable for some, the feedback from every single person was unique and valuable. You all understood the assignment and came ready with fantastic insights. My hope is that at the end of this month, you each see yourself reflected in the initial Asana rollout; it wouldn't have happened without you!\n\n97#Partners in Excellence initiative|Thank you all for taking time last week to be involved in an ongoing initiative that CL&S team are working on with teams on to identify common issues and bottlenecks we encounter on both sides of the fence when raising and dealing with requests from our Launch Customers. The discussions allow us a better insight into both how our teams operate and where challenges are faced on both sides when it comes to handling customer requests. This info gathered will be vital in helping our teams work more closely, improve synergy and identify solutions to help make a more streamlined and effective process of handling customer requests. Thanks again.\n\n98#Convatec Team|Matt and Mary-Liz,  Now that Convatec has been launched I wanted to thank you both for the help and support you have given me throughout this period. The launch faced many challenges and has dragged a little longer than thought, but I have to admit I wasn't too sad about this as it allowed the chance for me to work with you both for a bit longer.\n\n99#Convatec Champion of Champions!|Matt I cannot thank you enough for the guidance, management and all your expertise throughout the Convatec champion launch. You built tremendous relationships with the project team and were so professional and dedicated throughout.  The internal and customer team certainly enjoyed working with and benefited from your expertise throughout as you truly championed a smooth and successful launch!\n\n100#Bravo to the Belden Team!|Team, thank you for your support with the launch!  You were all helpful in each aspect of the launch as we made a quick transition prior to their Go Live.  The work put in prior to the transition as well as up until today has delivered a successful launch to the Belden team.  This launch was a true team effort and the Belden team is grateful of the work put into their program.  Thank you again and look forward to working with you all on the next launch!\n\n101#Grateful to be part of an amazing team|What an amazing group of humans that I am grateful to call my team! Over the last few months, I have been challenged in new ways personally and professionally. This group without missing a beat has been there to support me as a whole human. Helping my clients move forward, being a friendly ear or answering an SOS for help through Slack. In my career, I have never worked on a team that had each other’s back as much as this group of humans. Thank you and Go Launch!\n\n102#Jumping in on Belden|Matt C and Matt G, You all have done an excellent job picking up on Belden. We're so close to the finish line, yet there's a lot of tidying up to get us to launch day. You have both stepped in seamlessly when Shawn left and then also covered for vacation time. The customer dove right into the action plan today and closed a lot of items off their list. I have spent a lot of time with them and can tell they are relieved to have worked with you both. Thanks for stepping up and for doing it in such a seamless way.\n\n103#Pfizer Customer Story!|30 days ago we made a decision to capitalize on an incredible customer story opportunity with Pfizer. We’ve gone from brief, securing a senior Pfizer executive, main story production, capturing user testimonials from a myriad of people across their org to building relationships over dinner in NYC and final asset editing ..... all in under 30 days. Thank you for your commitment to our customers, for making decisions promptly, and for collaborating cross-functionally. This is all in service of ensuring that we maximize the business impact of the relationship and the created asset. We’re going to have such a great asset for marketing, customers, and sales in the future and your collective leadership made this all possible. Thank you!\n\n104#Team Synergy = Spotlight Launch Success|A SPECIAL THANK YOU to the entire launch team for Westfield's Spotlight R&R and Service Milestones!  Westfield Executive Sponsor and Program Leads expressed sincere gratitude in providing \"one of the smoothest and successful implementations\" they have experienced to date.  Brenda Polhman your style, expertise, and consultative approach may be replicated but never duplicated!  Thank you for your partnership and guidance in helping Westfield deliver a modern, streamlined program to delight and engage its employees.  Alise Parker your support in all things TS in launch AND in enabling Nom Flow 3 with default media images was top-notch, timely, and mindful of urgency for our client.   A huge shout out Johnny Grant, Ruchi Parikh, Chaslau Averchanka, Luka Crljen, Clarice Federman and Robert McArdle in Production Support for helping deliver a successful implementation of Nom Flow V3 with default media and reporting privileges.  Kudos to Yahor Prykhodzka for providing excellent Quality Assurance and to our Spotlight Branding Superstars Laura Fegan, Cliona Ward, and ihar Chumakou and IMC by Kelsey Cabral!  Last but not certainly not least, a thank you to Ann-Marie  Potemski for signing Westfield and for providing a supportive sales presence during launch, including a special in-person luncheon.  I am filled with gratitude for this entire team and for its Spotlight Synergy!\n\n105#Celebrating Cisco!!|So much magic happening at Cisco and such a spectacular and successful launch of their new platform today!!  Amazing accomplishment with a tremendous amount of teamwork and just plain, old, hard work from everyone on this core team.  Rich, your guidance through this launch has been spectacular.  Leading the way with your knowledge and suggestions is what made all of this happen.  It was an immense amount of work that all paid off with a successful launch this morning!!  Thank you!  Matt, I have never seen someone step into such a massive project and so seamlessly pick up and carry the ball for Rich during his vacation.  I held my breath as we slipped you in for that week and could actually exhale immediately.  Thank you!  Corinne and Jessica.  Awe inspiring!  Simply put, your suggestions, input, materials and development of materials have not only led to such a great launch but will continue to bring more and more attention to the new platform and all the additional solutions Cisco will now have at their finger tips.  Thank you!  Leslie, thanks for stepping in on this launch and keeping the home fires burning while I was out.  Who could ask for a better boss and friend?  You are a true gem.  Thank you!  Last, but certainly not least, to a wonderful CSM who jumped on this account 3 years ago.  We've seen a lot of leaders come and go here and still Claire has gone with the flow.  Cisco, in the past couple of years has added merch to their platform, developed a true peer to peer interaction, added Life Events and Service Milestones and is currently looking at Conversations!  Claire has been right there for this entir Cisco journey.  Thank you to my partner in crime.  Couldn't do it without you! Cisco's team has expressed such true gratitude for their experience in this launch and who can blame them?  This was an \"A\" team delivering excellence at every turn and relationships with the Cisco team that will go a very long way into the future.  Congrats!!\n\n106#Referral...|Matt - thanks for the email and looking out for another potential WH client to join the family. Always love referrals, thank you for passing the details along!\n\n107#Thank you! ⭐️|Cheers for the help with Convatec over the past couple days! This client is working with an accelerated timeline, so I really appreciate the speedy assistance you gave on Friday. You helped push the client to get me access to fonts, assisted with my brand center access queries - even offering up your US phone number when I was struggling with the many form questions! This enabled me to get the assets needed for the inner pages updates and kept us on track with the timeline. I’d also like highlight your advice on the printed award. It was great to get your thoughts on this before going back to the client due to the fast turnaround being required. Thanks a mil for your support Matt 😊\n\n108#Crush course on vanity URL|Matt – thank you so much for helping me with the vanity URL questions for GoTo.  Not only did you consult me behind the scenes, and shared similar tickets and emails, but you also jumped on a call when they asked to have one so I felt 100% supported. I appreciate you!\n\n109#Shining Stars of the Juniverse|Matt and Kate, we knew with Hayley being a repeat customer, we had to meet her expectations of the quality service and product she was accustomed to. After all, she's been with us long enough to remember initially crafting the Award Advisor language! And you were true partners, as exhibited by 1) our travels to Juniper's West Coast office 2) your role in modeling our Juniverse Awards giveaways - you knew I was going to use this picture for something good! - 3) the united and supportive front we had with every interaction with them. Matt, could we call this our Junicorn? (lame, I know) Somehow you managed to juggle this strategic launch alongside a little ole customer call Pfizer, and keep them both singing Workhuman's praises. Balance is the word that comes to mind with you - you provide steady guidance, firm direction and comforting reassurance and our clients thrive under your level of attention. Kate - you are an active presence on every call with a point of clarification or a document at the ready to share. Sometimes, I feel like the transition from LSM to CSM can be tough because the client hasn't had a chance to build that deep relationship but it's truly been us as a trio of support from the beginning. Not only that, you continue to rise to the occasion as we manage the significant change management from moving from a cash/cash card program to Workhuman best practices. Brittany, this is our second launch together and your steady support, keen observations and call backs to Customer Central content, and thinking out of the box to apply your strategic video skills were very much appreciated! Danielle, I appreciate your leadership support of this strategic client. You forge connections right off the bat with clients and are direct and action-oriented. I appreciate you championing what needs to be done for Juniper and I know Hayley and Kesy both feel supported and heard because of your swift and shrewd intervention. It's an honor to be in your orbits!\n\n110#Tenacious SOLI Tag-Team!|Dan and Matt - a special moment of gratitude to you both for helping Ipsen understand the nuances of SOLI AND the important benefits it will provide employees participating in Ipsen's BRAVO R&R platform across the globe.  You empathized with their curiosities and concerns while working to help them understand this complex topic at the most granular mathematical level.    Although we are still taking this SOLI conversation through its paces, we have moved the need toward Ipsen's understanding which will lead to smooth messaging to internal Ipsen stakeholders and employees!\n\n111#Continued customer feedback!|Matt, I love getting feedback from customers about launch team members, especially post launch:  \"You’ve been one of the best partners I’ve worked with and it was a great experience due in part to you.\"  - Adam Michael Duong (IT Lead) at Pfizer.\n\n112#Planes, Delays, and Korean BBQ|Matt and Kim,   What a whirlwind adventure on behalf of Juniper Networks! There's no one else that I'd rather travel cross-country with (twice) than you two.  We faced a unique scenario and a \"can't miss\" opportunity when Hayley mentioned that Juniper was having a vendor fair as part of their \"Return to Work\" initiative. Since their program the Juniverse Awards hasn't launched yet, we couldn't do a typical tabling event but instead, had a chance to promote Workhuman as a vendor as well as tease the Juniverse Awards. At their Sunnyvale, CA headquarters, our table was hands down the most popular based on foot traffic. As our Bright Horizons neighbor complained, it was hard to compete with the Workhuman lunch bags, Juniverse Awards chapstick, and space-themed candy, as well as our sparking personalities!  Based on our remaining swag, we talked to more than 50 employees. Even more amazing, PM Kesy and program sponsor Hayley took the time to set-up and staff the table with us, and Executive Sponsor Jerry even swung by to see how things were going. We then proceeded to have an onsite meeting with Hayley and Kesy, and were able to close the day by enjoying an epic Korean BBQ feast with them for dinner. Despite our red-eye flight being delayed for hours, your energy and enthusiasm kept my spirits up and definitely made a wonderful impression on our Juniper hosts. We made the most of our 36-hours traveling and onsite, and I look forward to the positive momentum carrying through launch in June!\n\n113#Holding the Pfizer fort down|Matt, a huge thank you for all the extra support you have given to myself and Pfizer over the last couple of weeks! Its never ideal when a new customer launches during PTO, but you stepped in to make sure the Pfizer team was supported. You allowed me to fully disconnect and enjoy my time away. You have taken the time to catch me up on all the open items and I am truly thankful! Thank you for being a great teammate to me and an amazing partner to Pfizer!\n\n114#This Pfizer love says it all...Bravo!|Matt and Joyce, I can't echo the Pfizer team's sentiments any louder. Their words are so spot on - you have been such amazing partners; we would not have been able to accomplish this without you. I couldn't be more proud and honored to call you my \"colleagues.\"  THANK YOU!\n\n115#BRAVO! for JELD-WEN UAT Support|Matt, I wish there was a recurring, social recognition integration with my brain to stream and package my continuous thoughts of gratitude for you and your extensive expertise in Launch, in general, and specifically in all that led up to the execution of the UAT Kickoff for JW.   As our client's UAT Lead stated, \"This is a momentous occasion.\"  Yes, it is!  I must take a moment and celebration YOU!  You have been insightful, supportive, and quite funny, especially in the challenging moments of our journey with the JW.  You gave the WH team a timely boost by taking the lead on the client discussion around enabling Reporting Privileges, while setting expectations for the sandbox experience in UAT.  Our goal, together, is to guide JELD-WEN in a successful implementation AND successful, global strategic recognition program for JW's professional and production employee populations.  Again, it must be mentioned, that you've done all this while launching Pfizer!  THANK YOU!\n\n116#Pfhenomenal and Pfast for Pfizer!|Matt and Rachel,  When you think about urgency, usually resolving last-minute fire drills comes to mind. However, when I think about Pfizer's launch, what strikes me is how perfectly it fits the definition of our \"Respect for Urgency\" value: \"Taking on new opportunities and tough challenges with a sense of urgency, high energy, and enthusiasm.\"  And that's just what you did as we came out of their Design Lab, and got surprised with a request from their CHRO to move up the launch two months earlier than initially discussed. You dove right in, and we stand on the other side, where you've successfully launched Pfizer's new global recognition program to 79K colleagues in merely two months.   I wanted to call out your partnership, I know this was the first time I was so embedded within a client's Teams environment but it allowed all of us to chime in as questions arose, trouble-shoot on the spot, and see how conversations were happening within their organization. Matt - you were speaking their agile language from the start, you adapted the project plan to support their preferred way of working, and you were involved with endless amounts of meetings to steer their workstreams in the right direction. Rachel, you were a steady presence along the way, and were holding key conversations on reporting - as we got a thorough overview on how to embed recognition into their process excellence efforts at PGS sites - and providing reassurance on the post-launch support model.  I hope you take a moment to pause and reflect on the magnitude of what was accomplished - launching a world-class brand in two months - and the satisfaction of knowing they will be a valued customer who will be investing even more in recognition in the years to come. Bravo to you both!\n\n117#Lighthouse Step 1|Wanted to call out the feedback provided from Workday from a Lighthouse Customer during their partnership interview you managed.   This feedback really accentuates the great job that you did managing and launching this customer.   Your contribution has gotten WH another step closer to our Workday certification, thank you.  •\tVery supportive and open to ideas and feedback •\tCommunication great •\tGreat vendor to work with •\tImplementation was very good\n\n118#Launch Team - Continuous Improvement Team Meeting|Team, thank you for coming together for the 2nd time this year to celebrate Q1 wins and collaborate on launch process improvements.  I was inspired by Nick's segment on trust and found another great Michael Jordan quote, \"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.\"  We have such a talented group of individuals, all coming together ensuring that we are always delivering the best launch experience for our customers!\n\n119#Clean Harbors SOARing to New Heights!|CONGRATULATIONS to the entire Clean Harbors Launch Team!   Each and every member of this team contributed at a critical moments leading up to our April 4th.   This swift and successful launch gave birth many opportunities for growth, including bulk uploads, new R&R programs, possible Workhuman Certification (Enterprise) while fortifying the important goals of improving retention and engagement in their workforce with special (and Presidential) attention to their truck driver population.  Yes, on the day of launch, the Clean Harbors Program Manager was invited to the White House to discuss the importance of improving inclusivity and engagement for women and minorities in the trucking industry.   Our PR team, with little notice, turned around some talking points just in case preparation met opportunity for the PM to speak on behalf of Workhuman Cloud.  Clean Harbors kept us on our toes but in the end the Program Manager shared that in her 32 years of being a part of implementations, rarely if ever, has an implementation gone this smoothly.  An enormous thank you to each and every member of this team!!!!\n\n120#Acing it for Ashland!|Matt- Congrats on another customer launch... this time with Ashland. You masterfully managed the entire project - from project planning, setting expectations throughout the launch process, and sharing best practices to keeping the customer up to speed and ensuring they were set up for success. Sure we encountered a few challenges along the way, but you navigated it all seamlessly and with the most respect for the customer. Congratulations and as always thanks for your partnership!\n\n121#JELD-WEN Journey - Ace In The Hole|Matt Gillen - I could not go another day without thanking you for joining the JELD-WEN launch.  You artfully weave your expertise into complex topics raised by the JELD-WEN team AND have jumped in to assist on some specific and uncommon asks from JW regarding payroll file, invoice, data retention, offline population.  I must mention that you’ve done all of this while simultaneously launching Pfizer!  When you happened to finish early on a call with Pfizer, you joined for the last 5 minutes of a JW call and, not surprisingly, delivered immediate value to the conversation. I could not ask for a better colleague and mentor to join me on this launch.  Together we’re committed to partnering with JELD-WEN to help them launch with a growth mindset that infuses recognition and gratitude into their employee experience, spanning 25 countries (and 20 languages) across the globe.  THANK YOU, MATT!\n\n122#Launch Team Offsite|Team, I want to thank each and every one of you for a great Team Offsite!  All of you participated fully, sharing your experiences, tips and words of encouragement.  From sharing your fun facts to leaning in how to show empathy to customers during a launch, I could not be prouder of the amount of \"yes and's\" that were used along with thoughtful discussions focused on Moments That Matter during a launch.  We celebrated 2021, highlighted the achievements of each other, and recognized our collective accomplishments.  I'm so excited to see what 2022 brings to each of you individually and as a team!  Remember, we are not just launching a program, we are helping our customers launch a culture!\n\n123#JELD-WEN Takeover Team!|Jamie and Matt, thank you for all of the hard work you're putting into the LSM transition for JW as I take my leave from Workhuman. Jamie, you have already put so much thought and care into this launch, and now you're taking over as the lead! Over the last few weeks, I've seen you really step up and take control of this very challenging client. Though you have little goodwill to work with, you're doing a great job navigating the client's sensitivities and demands to get them what they need to move forward through the launch. Matt, since stepping into a co-lead role, you've started to offer Jamie some help and insight as she works to satisfy the client. It'll be great for Jamie to have a fresh pair of eyes on the situation, and I'm happy that you two are partnering on this one. Best of luck with the rest of the launch, both!\n\n124#Keeping Us Moving Forward!|Matt,  I want to thank you for hosting the Weekly Launch Team Meeting while I was on vacation.  I just finished listening to the recording, you did a great job leading the call, adding in additional context where needed and keeping the team well informed.  Thank you for hosting so that our call wasn't cancelled and the team was able to connect!\n\n125#So many Toasts for launching SGWS!|Congratulations on launching Southern Glazers, Matt! It may have only been their Service Milestones launch but boy did it feel like it included recognition too! haha Throughout the launch you were calm, cool, and collected (as usual!) despite some of the challenges that came up along the way. Thanks for jumping in on the comms workstream calls to make sure they had answers to their many questions that overlapped onto the call. You handled everything so gracefully and with expertise. Congrats! On to the next one... cheers!\n\n126#Cool, Calm & Collected!|Matt - I just want to say a massive thank you for all of your hard work and support in getting the Toast program for SGWS to the finish line! This launch was not straightforward or easy by any means and we even had some unexpected hiccups thrown in our path that could have caused strain on our relationship with the program team but you were instrumental in providing clear communications from the start and addressing issues with a solid action plan in a time sensitive manner. The client's trust in your guidance and expertise is evident through this piece of feedback given by the PM: \"Even with the little hiccup, I did want to let you know I have truly appreciated your ability to bring this project to fruition. It has been refreshing given some recent projects. Thank you!\". It is always a pleasure to work with you as I know I can count on you to bring on your calm and confident aura that sets us up for success in any situation! Thank you!\n\n127#On Pfire with Pfizer!|Pfew, what a week! It's amazing to see how much has been accomplished in the span of five days. With the accelerated timeline sprung on us within hours of Pfizer's Design Lab, this really could be an award for urgency but I wanted to call out your brightly burning customer excellence all the way. Your days have been filled with the flare of Teams conversations, scheduled meetings, ad hoc meetings, and guiding Pfizer's motivated project team to quick, critical decisions. You walked them around potential land mines involving the Workday integration, digital security, and spend caps - oh my! You've established a rapport that had them naming the weekly project check-ins as a fireside chat. And walking away from the first fireside chat, Pfizer is confident and focused the next set of objectives with even more meetings to come. The speed at which they're rolling through key decisions is nothing to sniff at, when you consider that they're a complex global client of no small size. Let this be noted, we're not talking about a Fyre Festival disaster here, but the steady burn of a great recognition program to come.  I hope you take some time this weekend to bask in the glow of what you've accomplished before plunging right back into the Pfire next week!\n\n128#Cheers to you!|Matt, while the launch of SGWS, wasn't as smooth as a Pinot Noir.  You never took your eye off the ball!  There were so many components coming together just to get the launch off the ground in the first place.  Then adding in that we had system issues right before launch, brought us to a whole other level of complexity. The customer recognized right way your efforts, \"Even with the little hiccup, I did want to let you know I have truly appreciated your ability to bring this project to fruition. It has been refreshing given some recent projects. Thank you!\" - Todd.  It is quotes like this that make me tremendously proud of the Launch Team.  You exemplify what is means to \"Launch the Workhuman Way!\".  Thank you for all that you do for our customers and the team.\n\n129#Thank you!|Matt Gillen!!!! I cannot begin to thank you enough for your note with the amazing feedback you had working with Maura over the last year... You know first hand how my I value feedback on the team in any way, but receiving that from you about her made my entire week! It isn't often I get notes like this to tell me how much someone values the partnerships and as a leader it is one of my favorite things to hear! I am so happy that you are always so willing to share your experiences and I just wanted to say thank you for that! You are a true partner and I am very grateful for you my friend!\n\n130#Pfizer - One for the Record Books!!!|They say it takes a village and looking at this selling team, that statement could not be more accurate.  This $25M win at Pfizer is one of the largest in Workhuman’s history and has so many implications considering the current global context. Our discussions with Pfizer began back in 2007, making this 15 years’ worth of deposits.  Anyone that participated in and of those meetings played a role in this win. That said, when Alex Paz took this account over in the summer, he was intent on moving these discussions into actions.  He took the proverbial bull by the horns and aligned the perfect team to move this forward.  It began with a tight RFP response and custom demo and content, thanks to Michael, Anna and Amanda.  That led to finalist pitches, where Marcy delivered customer-focused insight that only she can.  Alex then brought Joyce, Matt and Rich to the dance to relay our Merck and AZ stories, which became our primary win theme.  And Orlagh delivered all the assurance Pfizer needed from an IT standpoint and Dan & Matt supported us on the product/integration side.  Once we were selected, Chris helped Alex and I align the commercial terms and then the real fun started.  Hillary expertly navigated one of the strangest contracting processes you will ever see, where procurement negotiated the entire agreement.  Julia also pinch hit at the end to iron out some MSA terms.  Thank you!  As we move to launch success, a special thank you to Amy for her leadership and support along the way. This entire team should be incredibly proud not only for the impact this will have on Workhuman, but also for the difference it will make for the 80,000 Pfizer colleagues who are also doing amazing, life changing work.  Let’s enjoy this one for a bit!!\n\n131#A week of challenges and  Many Questions!|I wanted to send out a sincere thank you for helping answer so many questions this week. There are a lot of moving pieces with any launch but one of mine required a lot of hand holding this week. The teamwork has been essential in keeping the conversation going and steering the ship in the right direction.  I am so fortunate to be on a team that is so supportive! Appreciate all the meetings attended, slack questions answered and impromptu zoom session! Thank you!\n\n132#Can't thank you enough!|Matt - I know we say this to each other a lot, but I'm so thankful that we're partnering on so many launches together. We've run up against some weird obstacles along the way with some of our latest customers and I'm thankful that you've been right there with me throughout. Thanks for always being there for those gut checks, attending the comms calls to make sure the customers know key information from a project standpoint (even though they should know it already), and for making sure I stay sane haha. I appreciate you and all the work you're doing behind the scenes to make sure our customers are going to have a positive launch experience. Thanks for being there and for being my sounding board on all the things!\n\n133#Launch Team Champions!!!|Dear Launch Team, I wanted to send this recognition in light of what was definitely the busiest ever year for the launch team. There has been some super significant and biggest ever launches(YET!!) with Accenture, IBM/Kyndryl and more. Looking back on the launch notes of Jan 2021, seeing launches like Edgewell, RGP, Cree, LogMeIn, Organon and much more,  reminds me of all the incredible hard work and dedication that was done in the year. I am so glad that I have the privilege of hosting our weekly Launch Meetings and interacting and collaborating with all of you wonderful humans. RingTheGong is now one of my favorite slack channels to celebrate all the successes we have together. It's incredible to see how much is achieved. Over the year you have had new hires and its clear with all the new additions, the launch team is going from strength to strength. Amy you are outstanding at leading this team. Rich, You are the champion of the launch processes. Liz, you have just gone and launched our biggest ever client (#legend), Judith you know everything there is to know about launch and the true leader of SMB's), Shawn you are continuously knocking it out of the park and my go to with any launch question, Matt C, every launch of yours I see goes so smoothly. Matt G, every launch we work on I am reminded of your dedication to delivering the best product and success to our clients. Kat,  seeing your 1 YOS recently reminds me of how much work you have gone through that year, incredible. Kel, working with you on Kyndryl showed me how awesome you truly are and how much great things there are to come. Nick, seeing Hess pop up on Ring the Gong just reminds be of the amazing work your doing. Jen, Rahul and Jamie, I have enjoyed collaborating with you so far and you have all been a joy to work with. Looking forward to all the future launches and I am so excited to see what is to come. It is truly an honor working with you all and I am excited to see what 2022 brings for you.\n\n134#Standing Ovation|As the last of our launches in 2021 now live, I have to pause and acknowledge all of your efforts this year.  You had a combined 76 net new and post launch projects – take a bow!  It’s a grind of patience, consulting, leading, managing and of course rinse and repeat on the same customer.  You all have incredible talent to bring work human to our customers. The  passion for their success and giving them the best program possible is clear across this team. I hope you all pause and reflect on your own journey this year, how you’ve done individually and as a team. And Rich…You lead from the front with confident, conviction and courage. You push the boundaries for more for each team member to be their best, for our processes and for yourself. Thank you all for an incredible year!\n\n135#Bringing Recognition Resolutions to life!|Matt - Thank you so much for your role in the December webinar around Recognition Resolutions! You helped us bring the value of Human Engagement to life for our customers by sharing how effective these tools had been for your recent launches. With your signature vocabulary, you brought credibility and authenticity to the data we shared around Human Engagement in a way I never could! This is so critical, as it helps customers see that Workhuman's product is supporting their employee engagement in new and evolving ways. Thank you!\n\n136#Improving the tools|Thank you, Matt, for your work on the new agenda template for weekly customer Launch meetings. Appreciate your work in putting it together and the details provided to help make an even better customer experience.  I had some questions going into using the template for the first time today and you jumped right on a call to guide me along. Appreciate your partnership in answering all my questions and opening the door for feedback as I continue to use our new and improved tool.\n\n137#Customer Webinar Superstars|Erin, Matt, Melissa and Patrick - I wanted to say thank you for all your help bringing our latest customer webinar to life. Each of you brought a unique perspective to the webinar and helped us level up each recommendation with real-life customer examples and data.  I also can't thank you enough for being so positive, supportive and collaborative throughout the entire webinar development process. It was a great way to end our first full year of customer webinars! 🎉\n\n138#Launch Process Improvements|Team, I want to thank everyone for coming to our Process Improvement Meeting with open minds and positive attitudes.  Everyone was engaged while we discussed the \"Sales to Launch Handover Process\", \"Client Introduction Call setup and execution\", \"Agenda Management\" and \"Launch to Customer Success Handover Process\". Having a mindset for constant incremental improvement is the key.  Our goal was progress, not perfection.  Although with this team I'm confident perfection is around the corner!  I'm so proud of the team and how everyone has leaned in as we tackled each improving each process.  Thank you all for being present, participating, and doing your part to ensure the very best launch experience for our customers!\n\n139#AMAZING URGENCY AND EFFORT|Team, where do I begin?  I am so appreciative and impressed with how you jumped in to make this deliverable happen this week....in arguably one of the busiest times of the year and all of the other supply chain issues demanding time and effort.  You pulled together under Matt's amazing direction (Matt - you are such a rock star and I have so enjoyed working with you on this launch!) and delivered on what we needed for the client to present to their leadership for approval and to keep us on track.  Again, so much talent on this team and your willingness to make this happen further demonstrates our values from teamwork to urgency to respect for customers.  THANK YOU!\n\n140#Luck of the Irish? Just you!|Matt, we joked that Deloitte Ireland was another unicorn client and in many ways, it was. You never know how a professional services firm will go, and in this case, we established a true rapport and partnership right from the beginning. Nothing they threw our way caused you to blink, whether it was no approvals for most levels or the fact that some employees don't have true managers, they have coaches. It was smooth sailing to launch, they were knocking out decisions and ahead of schedule, thanks to your expert guidance and careful planning. Then fate decided to bring in a last-minute tax issue. Workhuman is always careful to say we aren't tax experts. Guess what, Deloitte Ireland is a tax expert, and has a tax advisory practice dedicated solely to this topic! You skillfully navigated them through this roadblock of interpretation of compliance requirements, connecting them with similar Irish clients, keeping the lines of communication open, and engaging our Finance and Legal teams to work through the issue. A mere two weeks after their originally scheduled launch, we were celebrating alongside the Deloitte Ireland on their official launch day, with 140+ awards only three hours after going live. Speaking with their PM Geraldine that morning, she was glowing with her praise of your support (you had already met with her that morning to go over questions). Just like our clients, I know I always find it a pleasure to partner with you and always appreciate your collaboration and sense of humor. Congratulations on another successful launch!\n\n141#Sales support on a moment’s notice|Thank you for supporting us on short notice for a follow-up Pfizer call. You kept our streak going of bringing them credible and knowlegeable resources to show our depth and breadth of experience and expertise. This time it was integrations, IT Security and Compliance and Launch Success.\n\n142#Recruitment & Hiring Dream Team|I am thrilled to give my very first recognition moment to the recruitment and hiring team that brought me onboard!  The team made me feel respected and valued through every step of the hiring process.  My journey started with an informal meeting with Adam Basilio, who embraced Eric Mosely's philosophy that, \"its all about finding the right people, first, and then the right role\" within the organization.  Victoria Mitchell was a true recruitment partner - in our initial phone interview, she had an exceptional understanding of the Launch Success Role and what it would take to be successful.  Victoria and Ryan Nelson coordinated an amazing line up of interviews, first with Rich Sorrentino, my hiring manager.  As Rich shared more about his team and the Launch Success Manager role, it became clear that the LSM role was a great fit for me; and that Rich cares deeply about his team, his clients, and Workhuman.  (All very important for me to see in my new manager.) If I was not already sold on Workhuman as an employer, I was certainly sold after meeting with the next 5 members of the WH family, Matt Gillen, Brenda Pohlman, Kat Foley, Kerri Falkenham, and Amy Martin.  I enjoyed meeting and interviewing with every member of this team and, believe it or not, I felt energized after 5 back-to-back interviews and presentation.  Thank you for making the recruitment and hiring process more enjoyable and human than I thought possible!\n\n143#Let's TOAST to kicking off Southern Glazer's|Great job on our kickoff meeting with Southern Glazer's. As always, you heard the customer and adjusted accordingly to fit their needs. This includes us having a second \"kickoff\" call with them to make sure one of their key execs is in the loop. While there's a lot going on behind the scenes, you've shown our commitment to the project and to them on numerous occasions - especially since this project is so personal to their CEO. Thanks for being a great partner!\n\n144#Leading us to Excellence|To our fearless launch leader - thank you thank you thank you!! I always love teaming up with you to launch customers and this one was one the best! You provided such a calm and steady presence for the launch team, helping guide them through each step of the process. This time around, our program manager and Exec Sponsor were former WH customers, which can be a benefit and also a bit of a challenge, as our products have changed and evolved over time, but you helped them navigate these changes and fully embrace \"the new.  On a personal level, this was my first launch back from maternity leave and you were so supportive as I found my footing after being out for several months and I really appreciate your partnership. Congrats on another fantastic launch!\n\n145#Prepare for launch|As I reflect upon the last 4 months and the start of my journey here at Workhuman, I am truly grateful to be part of such a supportive team.  During this time, I have been working on learning the process of launch and the philosophies of Workhuman while every person has welcomed me onto the team, answered all my questions and has been more than happy to share their expertise and friendship with me. This makes me feel truly humbled to be part of such an amazing group of people. Looking into next week our team will continue to grow and I can’t wait to help welcome them with open arms as you did me. Thank you for all you do!\n\n146#Quality config docs!|Raising on behalf of Aliaksandr from Supportasaurus..  \"Matt, thank you for the excellent work on configuration documents. It is a very important document for QA and therefore it is very important to it is up to date and make notes in it. You do it each time at the highest level and this makes the QA process much easier. I look forward to working with you on future projects. Thank you!\"\n\n147#Successful Nutanix Client Launch|Thank you Nutanix launch team for all your time energy and effort completing the Nutanix launch, right on schedule!  Delivering like you do never will never get old to see, because when the Client Success Launch team delivers on all of our commitments, it continues to build more and more market credibility for us all.  Great work and thank you Rachel, Maura, Lisa and Matt, for delivering yet again, for another new client!\n\n148#AND or OR|Thank you all for jumping in to help with JPL's eligibility rule. I felt like I tried a million different ways to write the rule and none of it was working. I appreciate all the suggestions and trials and errors and re-running of the datafile. The rule is now working! Sometimes all it needs is another set of eyeballs, so thanks for lending yours!\n\n149#Continuous Improvement|Matt, I want to commend you on your leadership of the Ashland launch.  You have been continuously checking in with your PM making minor course corrections to ensure you are meeting the Ashland team where they are.  The key success to all implementations is to ensure the customer not only delivers in a timely manner to meet a launch date, but to also ensure the customer is educated and comfortable along the journey as well.  By checking in with the PM, you received feedback of, \"I do think that the meeting yesterday went better than in weeks past, it felt more structured and the way it was presented put more ownership on Workstream leads to give input, and also felt as though there was more guidance from the WH side.\"  While our process is sound and works for 99% of our customer, sometimes we have to pivot.  By listening to the customer, and meeting their needs you are truly building on your relationship capital, and becoming their trusted partner!\n\n150#Learning by example - Masterclass!|Shawn, Kat, and Matt, thank you so much for allowing me to shadow launches you have been working on since I started in July! Over the last few months, I have been able to witness firsthand what is needed to be successful as a Launch Manager.  This was done through watching challenging conversations on merchandise, gift cards, program design and data files. Learning how each of you advocates for your customers while keeping the project on task has been instrumental to my learning of the role. Looking forward to the final push to go live over the next few weeks! Thank you!\n\n151#Todd says \"Aloha!\"|Danielle and Matt, congratulations on winning over Todd Henriksen, now a 3 time Workhuman customer!  He mentioned how great it has been to work with you both, listening to Ashland's needs and scheduling some extra calls which will help Todd facilitate some great healthy debates around the program design. A true testament to the relationship being built, is that Todd accepted my check in call, while \"working\" in Hawaii.  Thank you for being such great partners to each other and to Ashland!\n\n152#\"Celebrationz\" of YOU|Matt, I am sending this award on behalf of the program manager at Kraft-Heinz.  On our transition call today, he had some amazing things to say about your project leadership and partnership that could not go unrecognized.  I did my best to capture his exact words as he was saying it... \"Matt, I wish I could give you a billion points for all of the work you have done with us.  You are an incredible project lead, always surprising us with your in depth knowledge of the platform (knowing every single detail) and thoughtful recommendations.  We will miss you but know that your legacy will live on through our Celebrationz program!\"  This is incredible feedback that speaks volumes to the LSM that you are and the relationships that you build with your customers.  Working with you on several projects now, I couldn't agree more with their sentiment.  Thanks for all that you do and especially for setting up the Kraft-Heinz program and relationship for success!\n\n153#Lots of Celebrationz are in order!|Matt - Thanks for all of your hard work and expertise on Kraft Heinz's program launch. Your flexibility and guidance helped shape the program while navigating some challenges along the way. On our follow up call after launch, Anil on the Kraft Heinz team wanted to give you one billion points as a thank you for your hard work! That's a huge compliment! Congratulations, Matt!   Iveta and Kelsey - Great job on the internal marketing campaign. You two brought the program brand to life on the visuals and the Kraft Heinz team absolutely loved what you developed. We even had some out of the box solutions including an elevator wrap and floor decals to really engage their teams.   Great job and congratulations!\n\n154#Shepherding Nutanix|Matt, I want to call out the incredible job you are doing with Nutanix.  You have not only been shepherding the customer to best practice, but at times it feels as though you've had to carry them there.  You are always so mindful of your customers' well-being, balancing the their desired outcomes along side what we know to be best for their employees. Keep the great work, I'm very excited to see this launch come to fruition.\n\n155#Electrify-ing nVent!|Team, thank you for all of the hard work that you've put into making nVent's Electrify launch a successful one. It's taken a little while to get here, but with everyone pitching in and pulling together, we made it happen! Joyce, what an incredible effort you put in with this challenging client. You were able to see the comms and training challenges that they were facing, and turn them into opportunities. You constantly brought joy and laughter to our joint meetings, really helping to build the initial relationship with the client! Matt, I genuinely could not have done this without you. nVent's program structure is complex and their goals weren't always easy to understand for a new LSM. With your guidance and help, I think we configured as cleanly as possible to make future maintenance and client scale easy. Cliona, when I log into Electrify I'm struck again by the streamlined beauty of the design you built. The client is so happy with it, and they're not easy to please! Thank you for all the hard work in taking multiple rounds of extremely minute feedback and bringing their branding to life. Susana, congratulations on participating in your first launch! I kept forgetting it was your first one due to your confidence and willingness to jump in and provide post-launch context; you're well set up for a successful relationship with Ann and An (A-squared?) Last but definitely not least, Alise! Thank you so much for all of your support during the nVent launch. This was a long one, but you stuck with them all the way, helping with some tight deliverable timelines on our end.\n\n156#Going for the Gold!|Team, I want to thank each of you for participating in today's quick lunch time brainstorming session.  We know the amount of hard work, dedication, and finesse that is required of our team day in and day out.  Everyone shows up to win everyday and it is evident with the recent stellar feedback we have been getting directly from customers.  I really appreciate everyone's time and focus in our meeting today.  This session was just one of many, as we look to constantly fine tune and improve the launch process. I truly value everyone's input and I look forward to future productive sessions.\n\n157#Great Kickoff Team|Matt, Lisa, Rachel and Meisha-Ann, thank you all for the inspiring job today completing the project kickoff of the Nutanix program!  Together you were an amazing team deftly moving from section to section topic to topic, responding to questions with cogent comments or deflecting distractions with ease and grace.  It was a master class in how to get a client off to an amazing start, and I thank you all for your great work today!\n\n158#Leveraging Launch for Analytics|Thank you so much for being open to me participating in the Nutanix kickoff. The quality of the discussion around metrics was top notch and I was so excited that the client was really engaged. I absolutely love your process of brainstorming ambitions and then generating success metrics specifically for each program ambition. I also loved your follow-up questions to the client to make sure they were thinking about absolutely everything. I just know we are going to get some stellar research out of this. When their Head of Analytics said \"Ooooohhhhhh, I love that!\", I knew we were in. Thanks again so much for the opportunity.\n\n159#Text properties schooling|This is long overdue but thank you so much for your generous knowledge sharing, investigation and explanation of all things text properties. I've learned so much and this information is a really valuable input to planning the client migration to v3.\n\n160#Galvanizing Customer feedback|While the definition of \"Galvanizing\"  is the process of coating iron or steel with a layer of zinc by immersing the metal in a bath of molten zinc.  I couldn't think of a better word to use to represent how this launch team \"layered\" Galderma with all the right tools needed for a successful launch.  We all know how great our Workhuman team members are, it is always a source of great pride when a customer takes the time to call out the group:  \"A big thank you to you and the entire Workhuman team. We are already seeing positive impacts from Galvanize. 😊  We will make sure to reach out to Mellissa as we work through some of the outstanding items.  Wishing you all the best, \" - Miranda   Great job everyone!\n\n161#Congrats on GALVANIZE at Galderma|Matt, Congratulations on a successful launch for Galderma. They went live with R&R, YOS, and Life Events! Their big driver for launching this recognition program with us is the CEO award. It's very prestigious across the globe, but peer to peer recognition is something new for many of their international employees. I think this will be a really positive program for their culture.  Let's talk about your impact. They were splitting from their parent company which delayed the timeline, but you persevered. They originally desired an April launch date to align with their CEO awards, but we didn't even have their new brand guidelines until April 8. And that was just a logo and font. SSO seemed out of the question since they hadn't completed their HRIS split from the parent company (meaning no data file, no testing), but you got a homerun weeks before the launch when their SSO resources came through. Our PM was stressed. She was the only one internally really trying to get this launched. You supported and guided her throughout the project. And when a last-minute kerfuffle between their HR and their Comms team in France occurred---you gave her options. And we went live ON TIME! Great work on Galderma. 5,000 ee's in 39 countries.\n\n162#Launch of recognition onboarding email!|Congratulations on our launch today! We’re working right at the top of the funnel, helping eligible users become active users, and then engaged users. Kellye, you have been the absolute core of this, creating the campaign, workflow, messaging, copy, reviewing with S&C, creating a test plan and doing it all in a new tool. You did a lot of troubleshooting and problem-solving throughout.  Phil, you’ve done the technical design and approach to client-specific elements, localization, data extraction and transformation, and working through numerous obstacles and challenges all the way. Throughout you’ve kept our collective minds on making choices for scalability, automation and extensibility.  Melissa G, thank you for the beautiful, thoughtful, Terra-aligned design and imagery for the emails. It’s no surprise that these are so well-received with such a strong design! Alan, thank you for keeping our onboarding organized and lining up guides so we take max advantage of the visits we drive. Elise, you did the actual data pull & load for the very first send, and helped us work through the challenges! Erin, without your effective introduction of this to our client(s), we wouldn’t be here! Thank you for conveying the value and lending your experience at heading off questions, concerns and obstacles. Jason and Andrew - you build our template on your Focus Fridays! Thank you!  Matt G and Melissa S - thank you for helping through customer questions that came up and your support! (I ran out of room so added some early stats in the image) I can’t wait to see the effect of your work on these users, more of whom will experience the benefits of recognition, and become active participants; on this client’s program, which will see culture benefits and outcomes faster; and ultimately for WH, as we extend this further and see the long-term impact on our launches, programs, customers and end users. And this is only the 1st email. Well done!\n\n163#Let's Win This!|Team - thank you so much for taking time out of your schedules to listen to my STRATIE dry run presentation and provide feedback. It was great to get together on a Friday with you all and you each added unique pieces of feedback that I can incorporate into my presentation. I've got some great takeaways and can hopefully bring it home!\n\n164#Focusing on What's Important|Matt - I want to thank and recognize you for calling out on our team meeting how important it is for us to take a deep breath and focus on what's important post-launch for our customers. To hear this from a teammate and peer was important and helpful. It's a nice reminder that we all face similar challenges in the work we do and in how we communicate externally and internally. I've recently been challenged in managing, balancing, and prioritizing customer needs post-launch and am adapting to larger customer needs. Thank you for this helpful reminder!\n\n165#Rock Stars|Team,  I want to send this recognition moment to thank each of you for taking the time to interview the various Launch Success Manager candidates we brought in for this role. Your expertise helped in securing our strongest candidates and I am extremely grateful for that. Rich, congrats on a successful interview process and your guidance throughout. Every time I work with this team, it always makes me excited. Looking forward to seeing the continued success of this group and what we will accomplish together moving forward.\n\n166#Sharing your customer and project updates|Thank you all for participating in the recent Customer Success All Hands meeting sharing updates on the happenings with your customers and projects.  You can definitely see all the great work you've been doing with what you were able to share with the broader team.  We covered a number of topics around customer relaunches, launches, Moments that Matter, AWS migration and moving the needle with your accounts.  The details you were able to share helped educate the team with examples we can all learn from in sharing with other clients.  Thank you for your customer focus in all that you're doing with your accounts and making it real for the rest of the team.\n\n167#Zimmer Biomet's IGNITE is Live!|Congratulations, team on the launch of IGNITE at Zimmer Biomet. They came in as one of the most prepared customers I have ever seen. And with their PM dedicated to this launch exclusively, it was clear this is a priority for the ZB team. Matt, you led this team to launch on time and boy, are they excited. With over 23,000 employees in 46 countries and an advisory committee involved, you navigated it perfectly so decisions weren't changed and were the best for the global audience. Lucas, you took their design and brought it to life on the website. They were so impressed with everything every step of the way and had nothing but good things to say about the process. And Mike, you have already shown that you're going to be a great partner for them. You've answered questions, guided them through reporting and admin functions and already been there supporting Matt. This should be a really easy transition based on the input you've already been sharing with them. Congratulations team, I have a feeling this one will be a great WHiQ study and WH ambassador.\n\n168#Last Minute SSO Magic for Galderma!|Matt-  Anything exciting going on lately?  Hmmmm maybe it's the OVERNIGHT SSO update that you pulled off with just about 2 weeks until Launch Day.  Our PM has been struggling for months to find information or even an internal contact who could help facilitate the SSO set up and information sharing.  She finally was able to locate an internal contact this week, a mere 2 weeks prior to launch.  You were clear on what was needed and how quickly the info was due back to Workhuman. Your tenacity and clear-headed nature certainly helped move this forward in mere days.  I am so glad to work alongside you, and know that our entire Launch has been and will be successful because of you. Thank you for being awesome!\n\n169#Thanks for the support|Hi all,  Thank you for your help getting Sandbox sites populated for a ton of trainings this week. You all got together, trouble-shooted some image issues and got us back on track. I appreciate the team work and things you did offline to get us up and running.\n\n170#Quick turnaround!|Thanks for your super quick responses to my questions regarding a number of upcoming launches. With a loaded June calendar, Operations wanted to ensure we were fully prepared and knew about every wrinkle in each program! This will give us the optimal chance of providing the best customer experience right from the start with these new clients! Much appreciated!\n\n171#Security Champions!|Hi folks,  We started the Security Champions initiative earlier this year as a way to add some extra oil to the cogs that turn in our security machine.  That oil helped us to get the machine up and running and up to spec for ISO 27001 - a massive achievement for the organisation.  Thank you all so much for you help, your input, your attendance and attention in the meetings and the work that you have done with your teams around the BIAs , getting AUPS accepted , making sure training was completed and so much more!  As you know we came through with: 0 Minor non-conformities 0 Major non-conformities  The champions were called out by the auditors as a definite boon to the organisation and our ISO efforts and we couldn't agree more!   The scope for the Security Champions extends beyond ISO and we look forward to working with you on a regular basis on Workhumans on-going security journey.  Thank you again!    .\n\n172#Teamwork Makes the WBAU Work!|Alise and Rahul, thank you both so much for your hard work over multiple days trying to run a test WBAU for Fujifilm's Appreciate and YOS programs. We're down to the wire on testing, and I know there was a LOT of back and forth via email, JIRA, and Slack. Matt and Nick, thank you for generously offering your time to review the configuration and talk through potential solutions. The success of the test awards was truly a group effort, and now we're set up for UAT success. Couldn't have done it without the whole group!\n\n173#Aaaand....we're rolling!|Matt, it’s only the opening scene of the WarnerMedia project, but I have to give you credit for the starring role you’re already playing in this feature project (I promise that’s as far as I can go with the puns). In all seriousness, I do have to recognize you for your flexibility, agility and discovery skills during our first few meetings with WM as you balanced meeting them where they are in their recognition journey but also setting them up for long-term success. This includes pivoting from the “normal” approach to engaging with their technical team as you made yourself available for the one and only timeslot the team offered, looped in the right resources on our end, made the agenda work to suit and maximize everyone’s time and were quick on your feet when the demo environment wouldn’t cooperate (as they wanted to see more and more). Earlier this week, you took the time to walk their PM through some options for structuring their awards helping her understand how the functionality would work to meeting their needs. It was a deep dive with lots of clarifying questions from Mary Kate, but it was time well spent to better understand their intentions for the program and explain how the decisions they make today will impact their program as it evolves over time. It’s these early conversations that set the tone for the rest of the implementation, and I appreciate you taking the time to help us all along on the journey through your valuable expertise and experience. Thank you! Looking forward to \"Act Two\"! :)\n\n174#We know that WE know!|Team, thank you so much for your participation and knowledge sharing at our training this week. There is so much that we can learn together as we grow as a team to create solid process, resources and guidance on the way we interact with our customers. Special thanks to those in the group that lent their voices and expertise to the training to further refine and enhance the experience for all. Now we can say that WE know!!\n\n175#Zimmer Biomet - Feeling the Love!|Team, I recently followed up with Andrea at ZB to check in and see how the launch was going.  I did so, assuming she would be elated and her response certainly confirmed that!  Here is how she respond, \"All is well.  We are in the midst of our design and configuration.  Everything seems to be on track.  Matt, Lauren and Mike are all great and providing us the proper support.  They have been extremely responsive and helpful.  April will be a busy month!\"  Wow, so great to see us exceeding expectations and executing so well with this key customer.  Thanks for all you do!\n\n176#Thank you both|Thank you both for your teamwork on Legrand. From getting their visuals ready, along with some last-minute edits, Iveta, you were an ideal teammate. And Matt, thank you for your quick responses when we needed some fixes before training sessions. I really appreciate the collaboration.\n\n177#WOW, WHAT A LIGHTNING brain STORM|Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for your participation in our SFDC Lightning migration prep sessions!  Your input will be crucial to the success of this transition.  Change can be tough but with partners like you, I'm incredibly excited for what's to come!\n\n178#Departmental Security Review|Hi folks,  Thanks so much for taking part in our first departmental security review as part of our ISO27001 work.   We're looking forwards to using the results of the questionnaire as a way to increase the security alignment across the organization and we really appreciate the time and effort that people took in their responses!   best regards, Dermot\n\n179#Stellar Buddy|Just wanted to say thank you, Matt for being a tremendous buddy and mentor for Kat. You’ve been key in connecting dots on process, the product and our inter workings. She is ready to co-lead accounts to put her training to use, thanks to your buddy oversight. Thank you for sharing yoir expertise and e perience!\n\n180#DAU/WOW!|Congrats to this team for remarkable early results in our latest launches, including Cytiva, where we're seeing a near 20% relative lift over the control group! Thanks to your efforts, employees at these companies now use the product more - and more often. On top of that, the great onboarding guides you've developed have users demonstrating greater mastery of product concepts right from launch. This leads to less employee confusion, fewer support calls, and lower friction for the program teams. Seeing it all executed with rigorous A/B testing and a clear focus on achieving success metrics is inspiring. Great work!\n\n181#Appreciating You!|Customer Success Teams thank you for the amazing work that you do for our customers everyday! We wanted to take a moment on Employee Appreciation Day to appreciate all of you for your truly impactful work. Even in the remote world that we’ve all been in over the past year you haven’t missed a beat and continue to change the world through how you engage with our customers and other internal colleagues. As we strive to bring recognition to the global workplace you are all making an impact through your efforts, activities and thoughtful interactions. From, Jay, Jose, Danielle, Michelle and Amy\n\n182#A very promising beginning!|Thank you all for your work on our first enterprise user onboarding experience. We are now >30 days in with Cytiva and 10 days in with Edgewell and we are seeing clear signs in the data that the onboarding experience that you all contributed to is effective at helping users understand how the program works and how they can participate, and, most importantly, driving them to take key actions. We are seeing excellent guide view data (the number of people who choose to take the tour), significantly more users uploading user photos (important for making the site feel human and providing social proof), significantly more users starting and completing nominations (this is very good), and more users going to my mobile as well. A key indicator that these guides are having the effect we want is that users who see the guide have much higher nomination completion rates than those who do not see the guides. It's early days; we'll want to validate across more clients, and certainly test improving it even more, but what a promising beginning! Alan - you were the director of it all, keeping it moving, putting forth suggestions, doing setup and problem solving, and talking everyone through the details again and again. Lisa - your design work on the guides was fundamental! Thank you. Ger - thank you for both your overall support but especially for the animated videos. Melanie - thank you for contributing the right words - they matter! Elise - thank you for helping work through control group approaches and analyses Phil - as always, your contributions to sorting out the overall plan & working through challenges were a huge help Rich - thank you for partnering on this and working through introducing it to the client and being ready for any questions that came up on it Erin - thank you for making sure LS had backup and the right messaging  Matt - thank you for reaching out to us on Edgewell and getting this into their launch Thank you again - we’ve only just begun!\n\n183#Enabling our new hires for greatness!|Team- You have all been involved with our new hires, some of you have volunteered to be their buddies and others have taken on various training subjects throughout the past year(s) and some have stepped up to do both! A few of you have even helped with our interview process to ensure we bring the RIGHT people onto the team. You all have really helped with the onboarding process as a whole as it can get pretty stale listening to the same person (me) over and over again :) This effort is often something that is overlooked, but I wanted to truly thank all of you for taking leadership and stepping up to the plate by taking the time out of your busy days to assist with this very important process.  We will continue to rely on you as our team continues to grow, and really appreciate it!\n\n184#Just Breathe|Thank you so much for your calm and steady hand today Matt.  I have a ton of respect for how you managed a nervous client and quickly got to the root cause of an issue they identified, which ultimately ended up being on their end.  It wasn't so much what you did, it was how you did it.  One step at a time, asking questions, pulling in the needed resources to investigate and ultimately getting the job done.  And I am so grateful that after driving the issue to resolution you made time to connect with me to coach me through it, helping me see the issue for what it was and reminding me that there is no such thing as a recognition emergency.  It made me think of the Pearl Jam tune \"Just Breathe\" and was a good reminder for me to do just that.  So I thank you and I applaud you for your approach, for your leadership and for your guidance.\n\n185#Living on the Edge(well)|Today Jan 11 2021 is a first for me.  I have a previous Workhuman customer who is now a 2nd time Workhuman customer!!!  With the launch this am of Edgewell's \"Inspire Joy\" program Total Rewards Leader Anthony Renella is now a two time Workhuman customer!  When I first started discussed Edgewell's need for a  program Anthony told me that I had to provide him with the \"A-team\" if he convinced his CHRO not to go to RFP!  Well they single sourced us, and once again the WH launch team proved that we are a company of A-Team members!  Each of you made significant contributions to the success of the design, build, messaging and launch of this successful new program!  Thanks once again for making the sales team look great!  Well done Inspire Joy launch team!\n\n186#Thanks for a great first week!|Matt, thank you so much for all of your help during my first week at Workhuman. You were super responsive to the questions that I had as I went through some of the initial onboarding materials. I know this week was busy for everybody, trying to fit in some last-minute work before taking some time off, but you were so generous with your time. Thanks again and happy holidays!\n\n187#Ready, Steady and Launch!!!!|To Amy, Rich, Shawn, Dan, Liz, Nick, Judith, Matt Carroll and Matt Gillen.  I wanted to recognise each and everyone of you for all the work that you all have put into the Weekly Launch Meetings with our team each Wednesday. I have been hosting these for a few weeks now and have been supremely impressed at the level of quality you deliver and excellent updates you provide each week. You all take the time each week to keep us informed on any urgent request, upcoming QA/UAT weeks, any autobau or wbaus on launch. I can go on and on!! Dan you provide the weekly spreadsheet each week to help us navigate the upcoming launches. Amy as every you offer such great leadership and guidance on launches. There has been so many clients this year we have all worked on. Even in the last number of weeks. Shawn you have managed Christiana Care,NCR and the exciting IBM project. Rich with the recent launch of Cytiva, State Street and Aviva. Judith you had Resource REIT, LLA, Moderna. Liz you have Manulife, Takeda and the new project for J&J. Nick with Nordson, Bobcat and now Cree. Matt C with 3D Systems, Amadeus and Snyopys. Matt G with P&G earlier in the year and now Health First and Edgewell. You all do such an amazing job in leading these launches. Congrats to each of you on every success this year and to many more perfect launches. Awesome work everyone :D if ever a team deserved a Workhuman Ring The Gong Trophy it is the launch team!!!!\n\n188#Best project in 20+ years in HR|Matt, Congratulations on the Health First launch. I am pleased to share that Mary said it was the best project in her 20+ year career. You had a great relationship with them from the very beginning and guided them through their many questions to understand the software and prepare their teams for a launch that will help them move to a more proactive, wellness based organization. One that promotes their value promise as the foundation for every recognition moment. With you at the lead, 9,000 employees are now a part of the WH Community.\n\n189#I can jump on the call.|Matt - Thank you for consistently stellar teammate. I slacked you today while on a comms. call with the Edgewell team regarding a few technical questions. You got back to me immediately and offered to hop on the call to discuss with the team. We ended up having a super productive conversation. The team is excited and energized. As they said today, they feel like everything is going TOO smoothly. I really appreciate the partnership. Cheers!\n\n190#Out of Office Hero|Matt, I can not thank you enough for covering my accounts while I was on vacations especially DXC and Cytiva.  DXC launched to 117,000 employees while I was away and you stepped right in to ensure a smooth launch was had.  While they had some last minute changes, that didn't stop you from delivering.  The client is so happy with their launch and they are already scheduling calls for what Phase II will like for them. Thank you for delivering and making this launch a success.  While I'm grateful for this assist, you didn't stop there.  Cytiva has an aggressive launch and losing a week due to my absence was not an option.  Again, you stepped in and ensured everyone stayed on task, allowing for us to begin UAT testing this week, well before the US Thanksgiving holiday.  We are well on our way, thanks to you.  Thank you being a great teammate and partner to our customers!\n\n191#VIP P&G|Matt, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job you have done getting the P&G Product Testers site up and running.  This project has been a while in the making and thanks to your hard work, it is over the finish line.  Your teamwork with the P&G team has been incredible and I can't thank you enough.  This will be the first of it's kind and another way we can celebrate the great partnership we have with P&G.  Way to go Matt!!!!\n\n192#Health First Help|Matt - I wanted to stop and say thank you for the assistance yesterday with Health First. When a couple of hiccups came up in the project I reached out to you and asked for you to assist Laura in resolving the matter promptly and clearly. You demonstrated great team work and jumped right into action. This took the stress out of it for Laura and resolved matters with the customer. Whenever I've reached out to you like this Matt I've always been so impressed by how you can see both sides of the situation. Thanks for being such an excellent team mate and for supporting Laura. 😀\n\n193#Version 1 Support!|Thank you Matt and Kel for your awesome support on the Version 1 launch project! Both of you offered tremendous transparency around how you could help me and the rest of the Version 1 team, and showed a real respect for handling urgent items and supporting me when I was out of the office for some summer PTO. I hope you both had as much fun working on this launch as I did! Whether it was addressing their unique requests or diving into odd config issues, you both really helped Version 1 have a great launch!\n\n194#Version 1 Successful Launch!|Team, thank you all so much for the hard work demonstrated here to ensure the successful launch of our latest Irish HQ'd client and fellow Great Places to Work customer - Version 1.   I could clearly tell from my interactions with Jarlath, Reka and Carol how much they appreciated the professionalism and dedication of our team to ensuring success.   And its great to also hear about the positive feedback from their employees following launch on Monday.  Thanks again all - onwards and upwards!  Cheers, Kieran\n\n195#Support and Mentorship|Your kind words of how Version 1’s launch was going throughout the process from you shadowing Nick is encouraging and welcomed. It’s great to hear as he takes his training and puts it into reality. What I also know that happens during this time, is the mentorship and guidance you are providing him. There are questions, nuances or customer reactions you can never train for but your expertise in sharing approaches and considerations is critical to Nick’s learning and the success of Version 1 program. Thank you for your support and mentorship!\n\n196#Making things easier!!|Thank You Matt, Michelle and Chris for your support as we transition our technical request tickets from SF to Jira.   Your support and willingness to help make processes & procedures easier and more efficient is very much appreciated.   Because of these changes and the support and training provided, we will be able to support the Here2Help pilot in a more timely and customer centric manner.   Thanks from all in Client Services!  Enjoy the award\n\n197#Pulling out all the stops...|Michelle and Matt, I wanted to call out the tremendous work you have done and are doing to move technical requests out of Salesforce and into Jira. Matt, you heard about the project and raised your hand to PM the implementation and roll-out. Your insight of Jira's capabilities was invaluable to invision a new way of working with technical request. A Kanban board, reporting, visibility and the various workflows and alerts. Michelle, you had such an open mind to a different and better way of enabling you and your Team to crank through these requests and assign work. Michael, once again you reviewed the specs and took in the feedback in order to turn the vision into a working reality in Jira. After each testing session continue to work through the challenge and find a solution. Then a curve ball came your way right before roll-out...you each reviewed your options, pivoted your action plans and re-imaged the forms and flows a second time. Your attention to detail to ensure a smooth launch was impeccable.  Thank you for your hard work and turning this thought into reality in such a shot amount of time.  The Team is going to love it!\n\n198#Dream team|I want to thank each of you for all you are doing with Health First to launch their new program.  Mary is very complimentary of the team and the process.  (and she is a tough cookie to win over).  I truly believe Health First will be a great client and will continue to grow their program.  They also are looking forward to how this program will drive their key business outcomes.   Thank you ...thank you...thank you\n\n199#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n200#Watching in action|As the new P&G panelist program kicked off, I wanted to tag team on this launch for support on such a quick turnaround time and importance of the customer. Your confidence, tone and approach really put them at ease, and especially the Project Owner. I think the bigger win for me was watching you in action with P&G. I was put at ease even though I knew the process. I'm looking forward to partnering with you on this and watching you Wow P&G!\n\n201#Quality Energy you brought to the Avangrid launch|Joyce, Tiffany and Matt, I was reflecting over the weekend while I was scrolling through Avangrid's LinkedIn post about the launch of their new program Gratitude and reading all the responses and likes/thumbs up/hand claps.  This build and launch was such a success because of the quality work, attention, patience and ENERGY you brought to this journey.  Your previous work experience in this industry brought a knowledge and understanding  as well that could not have been matched by anyone else here.  I received emails from both the CHRO and their project manager on how impressed they were with our partnership and stating the exact right team was chosen to bring this program to life.  Their LinkedIn post reinforces my words above.   A lot goes into building these programs.  This is a major change for this organization and could be the example in this industry for Workhuman moving forward. RIght now, a new culture of recognition is coming to life before our eyes.  The three of you should feel proud of the results and how you approached this journey.  Cheers\n\n202#Moment of Gratitude from Sales Bootcamp 2020|A few weeks back, the sales team wrapped up an excellent bootcamp. As part of this experience we had the pleasure of hearing perspective from three very happy Workhuman customers: Claire Wheldon from AstraZeneca, Lark Kalstad from Lam Research / Symmetricom and Peter Church from Avangrid. Each shared important perspective that will help us become a more effective sales organization.   Without a doubt, these conversations would not have been possible but for the many unsung heroes who helped to create, launch and maintain the successful programs from which each of these perspectives were grounded.  While it may have taken a while to track down all who may have been involved, with Meghan Honan’s help, I’m happy to finally be able share this moment of appreciation. Thank you all for helping to make such happy customers AND, by extension, such a memorable conversation and learning experience!:)  AstraZeneca  Ongoing CSM – Kylie McMillian Launch LSM – Rich Sorrentino S&C – Lynette Silva        Lam Research   Ongoing CSM – Claire DiDonato Prior CSM (at Symmetricom) - Marcy Ricci Launch LSM – Rich Sorrentino S&C – Lauren Spenser   Avangrid   Ongoing CSM – Tiffany Steinke  Launch LSM – Matt Gillen S&C – Joyce Silvia\n\n203#Gratitude for a Great Team|AVANGRID's Gratitude program launched yesterday and it was amazing to see their PM Erica Irvine speak about the launch in glowing terms on LinkedIn. Even before that happened, I had a glow of satisfaction over the partnership we've forged with the AVANGRID team and the confidence that we had guided them to the best of our ability to something amazing for their employees. AVANGRID was notably one of our clients who rather than suspending launch plans during COVID, realized the importance of recognition and moved their launch even earlier than planned.   Matt, superb job as always being a trusted advisor to Erica and the team, with the right blend of guidance, humor and voice of experience. Your rapport with all sides of the AVANGRID house, down to their payroll and IT resources was clear. I joked with you about the hiking trip this weekend but it's truly a testament to your planning and connection with the team that they've had such a smooth implementation.     Tiffany, from the moment we met with Erica in person back in March, you were in the forefront as the voice of customer experience. You were present in every interaction, and I wouldn't even call the transition to you past launch as a formal transition, because Erica already knows you and looks to you for perspective on the program.   Craig, you've been my \"ride or die\" through thick and thin of every meeting and interaction with Erica. It was a bonus that you (and Matt) had utility experience to mention in interactions with Erica. I appreciated your openness to learning every facet of the client interaction, and your commitment to be there for AVANGRID, it was great to have a sounding board for our launch approach.   My final gift to you three (may you forgive me) are the still shots above from the excellent anniversary video that Tiffany created for Erica. I thought it was a fitting symbol of how the team came together to make a moment that matters at every step of the way for AVANGRID and Erica.\n\n204#Host with the most|Matt, thank you for your help while I was away.  We were at the beginning stage of a launch with a client that was not only very motivated, but also under a condensed timeline.  Without hesitation, you volunteered to not only run their weekly call, but also hosted the data file kickoff call which as we know is such a critical conversation for developing the program.  During my time away, I felt at ease since you assured me you would be able to handle the extra load and that you did.  I saw all the follow up you provided (which some of your explanations on topics I will use!) and your work helped progress this client forward during my time off.  I appreciate your support and teamwork. Thank you!\n\n205#Launch after Launch, Success after Success|Everyone, I want to thank you all so much for the incredible hard work, determination, sometimes long hours and fantastic success you constantly bring to every launch you all work on to make these all a huge success.  Amy, I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing leadership you show with your team. Anytime we have worked together on launches. You are instrumental in the phenomenal success that we have with each of our launches.  Liz, You had one of the biggest launches of the year with Pepsi. I know first hand how much brilliant work that you put into getting clients to launch. It was inspiring and you set the standards for dedication and hard work. There were other launches this year in Santander, Corteva and Plantronics.  Rich, With one of the other major launch success stories this year in Astrazeneca. In particular, noting the incredibly complex drools rules. Not only AZ but you were key to some other great launches with State Street, Aviva, LAM Research and Sabre. Shawn, The experience you show on launches is mind blowing. We worked on a few success stories in Stepan Company and EMC Insurance, NCR Corporation. As well as upcoming launches like Day & Ross.  Matt Gillen, I can note the incredible work you did on Manulife and UCB. You managed these so well and I am sure the upcoming launch of Avangrid will be another success story.  Matt Carroll, We have worked together on some great launches. Omnitracs & Emerson were both fantastic launches. There are also some exciting upcoming launches that you are involved with like Teknor Apex. Judith, Working together on launches, you always stun me with the unbelievable level of quality you put into these launches.  There are so many launches with your name on it: Liberty Latin America and so many upcoming launches like LivaNova, RTI and Tracelink.   Nicholas, I have been so impressed to see the great work you are doing with both the launches of PTC and Gundersen. I'm sure these will be great client launches.\n\n206#Refined, respectful response to R1|Matt, I just wanted to call out the great follow up you provided to R1 last week after covering their weekly project call while Matt C. was out of the office. You sent a concise, clear and timely summary of the project call, but as you quickly found out, Sara usually has lots (and lots) of questions to ensure their rather large project team is aligned and on track. Your response was simply brilliant! You managed to keep it clear, to the point, polite and without room for misinterpretation of next steps for their data call and expectations upon Matt’s return. As I replied to you immediately, what class did you take in school, because I could definitely learn some lessons from you! Thank you for keeping things moving seamlessly along so Matt could enjoy his vacation!\n\n207#Making it happen for Aviva|Matt and Gerard, thank you so much for taking on Aviva SSO while I was on vacation.  Because of your efforts, we are now in discussions with Aviva to move their Canadian population launch from 21 September to 31 August.  If we missed the SSO configuration, it could have possibly cost us time on the project.  Because of your efforts and willingness to assist Aviva while I was on vacation has had a real impact on the project.  Thank you for affording me the opportunity to completely relax during my time off, knowing that Aviva was in great hands made all the difference!\n\n208#Keeping State Street on Track|A huge thank you to everyone that kept State Street on track for their mid August launch.  Because of your efforts, even though I was on vacation, State Street has closed out the extremely important task of pushing SSO to production.  At least once a week, sometimes twice, someone from the State Street team tells me they have never worked on a project with such a \"tight\" deadline, nor made so much progress in such a short amount of time.  Because of your efforts this launch is still on track and I was able to completely, 100% enjoy my time off.  I had all the confidence in this team and knew State Street was in great hands.  A huge thank you to everyone!\n\n209#Leading the charge on a lighthouse account|Matt, this was no easy feat! A challenging launch during challenging times. All done remotely with many twists and turns along the way.... You persevered and got them live! Great work and thank you for all your efforts, late night calls, early morning emergencies and through all of it ensuring a positive customer experience.\n\n210#Helping in a time of need|Matt, I wanted to thank you for jumping into action when we had a bit of an issue with the client folders on OneDrive. Behind the scenes I thought all was well...but it wasn’t. We still had duplicate customer file last and a mix of current and outdated folders. You rolled up your sleeves and took decisive action to fix it all without a roll back or IT help. Then, when all seemed well we thought there was an issue...you may have caught me on a “bad” day but your calmness helped me see where I could and should help. Thank you!  Then, we hopped on the phone with IT to figure out you had resolved the problem and the system just hadn’t caught up to you. Thank you for taking the lead to ensure this was not a bigger issue and thank you for your tolerance (although you should not have) during my “bad day.” Thank you for lifting me up on a day when I needed it!\n\n211#Seamless transition|Matt, as you know this is the first time I was part of a client launch process and you have certainly set the bar very high! I am very grateful for your leadership and professionalism throughout the UCB project. You were very present along the way, always keeping on top of the countless complicated requests that came from the client. Thank you for the outstanding transition to Customer Success. You really made my job way easier. You taught me a lot and I honestly hope to work again with you in the future.\n\n212#Keeping my ship pointed in the right direction|Matt, thank you so much for taking the time at the end of your day to help me review a very important document I had to present to a customer in launch.  You're feedback and attention to detail not only made my message better, it also boosted my confidence.  Thank you for being a great teammate and being so responsive to my time in need.\n\n213#Way to ROCK it today!|Matt, the last few weeks have definitely not been smooth or easy.  We've had a lot of pendulum swings on the Manulife implementation.  Most recently we were asked to present to the CEO and the entire ELT team.  Several prep calls, (including one 20 mins before the meeting in which we were asked if we could change the config)...   You showed up and delivered!  Your talk track during the demonstration was succinct and tied back to the clients ambitions.     Great work!   I wish I could have made this moment public, but given the screen shot I felt it best to make it restricted. Please know you did an amazing job!\n\n214#LSM Certification Success|Liz, Matt, and Rich-There has been an immense amount of work and behind the scenes creation to get this Certification up and running. I want to thank each and everyone one of you for putting in the time to create documentation/presentations, train, and certify on each of these launch topics. We are almost at the end of the certification and let me say, we have come SO far! We now have a full certification schedule, expectations for each milestone, documentation that can be used for a cookie cutter approach moving forward, and trainings on all topics Launch! This could not be pulled together in a cohesive unit if it wasn't for each one of you taking time out of your busy day to get all of this put together. Liz-your attention to detail, organized manner, and delivery of all things strategy has been so impactful and impressive! Matt-you have put together meaningful and helpful documentation on key topics throughout launch and great at role playing! Rich-your DRL's rules and eligibility rule training was so good that it will be going into my arsenal of \"advanced trainings\" for all of Customer Success(hope you don't mind!). You all bring different perspectives from how to position/deliver topics to customer scenarios that you have encountered which is the best way to train a new hire! The end is almost near and with your dedication and involvement, I will be able to package this up and be able to deliver this certification to the next new LSM that walks through this door. Thank you so much!\n\n215#Doing the Right Thing|Brenda and Matt, We faced a unique scenario with AVANGRID. They were on the cusp of approving their branding with Shine, the program name they picked with careful deliberation with ambassador outreach and voting. They are pleased with connection that Shine has with their utility industry as well as shining a light of recognition within their organization. However, upon learning that another client in launch had turned away from Shine as a program name in this current climate due to possible negative connotations with the African American community, it seemed like the right thing to do to raise this possibility to AVANGRID. In a consultative way, not with the intention to derail their forward progress, but to allow them to proceed with a fully informed decision. I thank you both for your counsel and unwavering support in talking this through and proceeding with notifying the PM in a private way. She was thankful that we raised this issue with her, especially with the opportunity to check with their internal I&D resources before they launch. And I think it went a long way in proving that we have a true partnership and their best interests in mind.\n\n216#U-Inspired UCB|Matt, Lynette, Guil and Kieran a massive congrats to you all on the launch of the U-Inspire program. UCB acknowledged the benefits of bringing U-Inspire to their people and connect 7,500 employees through gratitude. It is especially amazing considering the current climate we are in. There was never any hesitation from them on launching. Now especially, they see how important gratitude and connection is as we all go to work during these crazy times. This truly is a testament to the amazing work each one of you has done over the last number of months and the value of Workhuman you have shown since our journey began with them. At times during this launch we did face challenges, but thanks to you all for digging deep, your resilience and determination helped us to get UCB to this point, another successful launch and a key client for the International team and Workhuman,. Well and thank you all!  A nice message to the team from Ann Gudiens, Head of Global Reward at UCB  ‘’After a long and exciting journey this is the moment we have all been waiting for. I know it doesn’t stop here but to get to this point is already a HUGE achievement. Thanks to all’’\n\n217#Tackling the tough issues head on|Lauren and Matt- I havent worked with either of you in a while, but am constantly impressed on Manulife both on calls and via email where they continue to raise the same questions and concerns and you are so well versed and well spoken with our company stances. Most recently the discussions about duplicate awards and nonmonetary awards came up again and you handled it beautifully Lauren. Matt, your persistence on the importance of timely decisions and management of the large team on their side is impressive. Looking forward to launch day and seeing the ongoing success of this customer!\n\n218#Navigating team dynamics|Navigating personalities and team dynamics of any customer is challenging. Let’s add more complexity when you have 2 customers going through this at the same time. I wanted to call out what an amazing job you are doing with UCB and Manulife and their challenging team dynamic situations. UCB is having a power struggle on a request that puts you in the middle of both companies. Manulife’s team of 20 pushed the limits on the number of calls, first daily and then weekly, so all can be heard. Your composure in managing these situations is unbelievable and we are proud you are representing Workhuman on these projects!\n\n219#Successful Global Virtual Design Lab|Lauren, Matt and Liz, thank you!    I truly believe you all did an amazing job with Manulife Design Lab.   This definitely wasn't an easy one and is a VERY important customer for us on the Canadian market.   Lauren, I appreciate all of your flexibility and help leading up to the design lab.  You helped field questions and were flexible in your approach given all the backwork we had done to prepare them through early guidance.  You also quickly pivoted and adjusted the agenda when they changed the timing on us a few days before the actual design lab.     Matt you helped ease some of their technical concerns and questions.  And Liz you are already laying the foundation for a great long term relationship.   Although we spent 7 hours on ZOOM over 2 days, it didn't feel long and flowed very smoothly!  We received great feedback from the customer!  They are excited to launch. Great work team! Can't wait to see Spotlight go live!\n\n220#Kicking off Avangrid's Design Lab|Joyce, Tiffany and Matt,  This is a bit overdue.  I was just reflecting on what a great job the three of you did for the Avangrid design lab.  Originally, we were supposed to be on-site but, the new challenge the world is facing made us do some last minute shifting to a virtual design lab.  You all pulled it off very well. The three words that come to mind immediately are prepared, knowledgeable, and engaging.  Virtual meetings can be tough.  Hard to read the crowd and a challenge to get them all to participate.  Prepared, you all knew your stuff and not only finished on time but early.  Knowledgeable, not only did you know Workhuman but, you brought your previous experience from working in this sector to the table which added tremendous value.  Engaging, asking great questions, keeping a smile on your faces even during audio difficulties with Zoom and overall collaboration among our team and with the Avangrid team as well.   The CHRO reached out to me and said how pleased his team was with the day and are excited to bring this to life. With sincere gratitude for quality! Scott A.\n\n221#Taking a leap forward...|Team, I wanted to call out the great work you are both doing to scope a new and improved efficient and effective process for the technical specialist requests coming from the Customer Success Team. We had a brief meeting to validate the vision and scope and you both took the ball from there. You have since outlined the needs and process changes that are necessary to to make this process so much better for all! I cannot wait to see what you come up with next as we move this initiative forward. Keep up the great work, this is going to be spectacular!!!\n\n222#Resilience all around|This team never ceases to amaze me. Your usual day-to-day launch lives have been completely turned upside down and then sideways, and in some cases upside down again. With a mix of customers still moving forward with on target launches and some delaying due to COVID19, you’ve been learning to adapt and adjust. You’ve gone from sprinting to learning how to jog and in the world of LSMs, that simply is not close to being easy. I wanted to acknowledge your resilience over the past month. The weeks ahead will bring the next launch challenges no doubt, but I know you will succeed again, because we are a team and we are in this together!\n\n223#Resideo help|Matt, thank you so much for jumping on a somewhat tense call with Resideo today! You were articulate and clear about our processes while also being respectful to the client. Sue from Resideo reached out after the call to express her gratitude for your willingness to discuss this with their team again and for your patience. Thank you for being a great team player!\n\n224#Leading by example|I came to you this morning with an ask of helping a teammate through a sensitive payroll encryption issue. Without hesitation, you jumped in to help assess the situation, what's been configured, what's been done by Prod Support and what was shared with the customer. You were able to then provide a game plan to address the issue and follow the proper steps to ensure we are aligned in the company practice. I appreciate you leading by example and your willingness to guide your teammate through the issue!\n\n225#\"You guys really have your claws in here!\"|Loved getting this text from my friend at GLG one day before launch last week.  His next text was \"Our CHRO talks about Workhuman and the upcoming program every chance she gets!\"  This doesn't happen by accident.  You set up Workhuman and GLG for success from the beginning and built real credibility with the core team at GLG as well as leadership.  This allows the CHRO to promote the power of recognition and Workhuman as something that will have an impact on their business.  Great work launching a new customer Matt!\n\n226#In the weeds with me!|Matt - I appreciate you jumping in right away to answer some questions that were in the weeds from my comms contact at AstraZeneca while Rich is traveling. You overheard my question, answered it, and then jumped straight into Sandbox and the Config app to test the scenario of privacy settings and the impact on group awards as well as confirm their platform configuration. This was the at the end of the day, you cheerfully answered another follow-up question, and helped ensure a timely response back to the client. Big thanks - and I learned something new about our platform functionality. ;)\n\n227#Launching into 2020|Thanks to each of you for bringing your best selves to our offsite. We came together to be vulnerable, share experiences and strategies to move our team and processes forward for efficiencies.  Thank you for your commitment to excellence for ourselves and our customers!\n\n"
"228#Playing to Win|Matt, now that 8x8’s Play to Win program is officially live, I want to thank you for your partnership on this project! You have been willing to partner, shadow, cover, listen, and support this client over the past 4 months. You have been instrumental in their launch and keeping them on track, particularly when I was out on leave. They were an interesting crew to work with, to say the least, and you took everything in stride while offering both myself and the client helpful advice and strategies. This is my first official push to production and I’m so pleased to have worked with you on this one! Thank you!!\n\n229#SNCL Supastah!|Matt- #Wow, SNCL just could not stop singing your praises today on the handover call.  Then they followed up in email with such direct quotes as \"It has been a pleasure working with you and we will miss your calm support\",  \"Thank you again for your support!  It was great meeting you and working with you !\" and \"I am please(d) to send you a #thankyou for your precious help \"  Happy to be helping with this transition to ongoing Customer Success support and it was really great to be a witness to such a happy customer relationship!\n\n230#Resilience for SNC Lavalin|SNC has been quite the journey as we started off with YOS launch to their UK population with a phased approach for recognition later, but then switched gears to work through an employee expansion to launch YOS and R&R together to better align with their organizational change across the UK and Canada for SNC and Atkins. This also resulted in a rise and repeat of the Design Lab to align all the stakeholders on the path forward. Sprinkle in the customers desire to utilize a 3rd party design firm, the addition of two more countries for monetary recognition plus program manager went out on leave nearing the end of the launch - your determination and persistence was outstanding as you guided the customer through this curvy journey including a few bumps at the end requiring additional time and effort. I thank you for your leadership and recognize you all your hard work and resilience that went into this launch! Congratulations Matt!\n\n231#Presenters Extraordinaire!|Danielle, Matthew, and Greg - Thank you for presenting our groups work during the Ignite Solutions breakout session. I appreciate you all for being willing to get up with not much direction or preparation. Cheers!\n\n232#Getting going with GLG|Matt - While we are only just beginning with GLG, I have to tell you how much I appreciate your respect for urgency.  They have come to us with a desire to launch fast (nothing new there!) and you have been there to support them in that effort from day 1, attending workday calls in advance of our kickoff, being proactive in setting expectations with them on the various deliverables and decisions they will need to make, sending them all of the documents they will need to be able to make those decisions and the list goes on.  You strike such a great balance of being direct and supportive all at the same time and I know they are in excellent hands with you at the helm.  I’m excited to partner with you on another customer and look forward to a great launch!\n\n233#SNC-Lavalin launch kudos|On the eve of the SNC-Lavalin launch, I wanted to take a moment to recognize you since you deserve some major kudos for this launch. Even though there were so many contacts involved on the SNCL side, you managed the project brilliantly - making it look seamless even when I know it wasn't. That data file... well, at least you didn't have to fly to Montreal afterall (I hope!). I always enjoy partnering with you on launches and love your work style. Thanks for being a great teammate and helping SNCL through everything so we can have a great launch day tomorrow.\n\n234#Yes and has come to life...|Team, I know it is difficult to take two mornings out of your week while you have Customer calls, emails and launches happening to attend a knowledge share workshop on some of our trickiest topics.  I must say it was impressive to see everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge building upon each other thoughts.  The collaboration among such a diverse group of people and roles  was simply amazing to be a part of and witness among a group of 40 strong.  If you were wondering what Respect for All looks like...you were just a part of it and each of you made it happen!  I would be remiss without calling out your contribution to moments that matter by agreeing to be present in our workshop and any other meeting moving forward.  We all know how it feels when someone/s is multi-tasks and I was so pleased to see laptops closed and true focus and attention on the subject and task at hand.  Thank you all for a great two days, I cannot wait to see what this Team does next.\n\n235#In a pinch|Matt, thank you SO much for stepping in to help me today. Between sick kids, spend management configuration, and an intro call, I received a time sensitive request from 8x8 to update a slide deck for a meeting with their SVP today. And we all know how important this meeting is! It is going to determine the timeline for the remainder of their project. You did an amazing job stepping in to make the requested edits perfectly and then give me a call to let me know what you did. I was able to shoot it back over to Michelle with plenty of time for her to prepare. Thank you!\n\n236#Tool Requirements|I wanted to thank you all for your thoughtful contributions for our implementation tool requirements, not only from the requirement aspects but from the approach on how to weight, evaluate the solutions and for embracing any mindset changes. I love how we are aligned on the needs of our team to continue to make us better and for a better customer experience!\n\n237#Coverage extraordinares|Thank you both for covering 8x8, OpenText, and NCR for the past two plus weeks while I was on leave. Going through my emails, I am so grateful to see that each of my clients continued to have amazing support in my absence. From Recognition Tips questions, to SSO configuration, to project timing changes, everything was covered and under control. I really appreciate your support and teamwork so I could enjoy the holidays with my family!\n\n238#Great partners!|Hello everyone. I wanted to take a minute and thank all of you for your great team work in 2019. I see our teams as very much a partnership and I think I can speak for all of Branding when I say that as partners go - you guys are fantastic. It’s been a very busy year - with a few challenging moments - but through our collective passion, drive and determination we have delivered excellence for all our customers. I wanted to thank you all for the hard work and to wish you all happy holidays. I look forward to continuing our partnership and collaboration in 2020! Cheers!\n\n239#Great progress!|I wanted to call out the great progress you’ve made all year in your role, Matt! You’ve taken on new challenges with positivity and willingness to continue to grow. With every project, you’ve taken all the bits and nuances from your previous projects and applied them to the current ones to strengthen the project and relationship with your PM. It doesn’t go unnoticed! Even with UCB, you jumped at the chance to utilize your background, enhance it to see how it can benefit the team. That mindset is exactly what is necessary for this team to continue our evolution. I’m excited to see your strides and accomplishments this coming year!\n\n240#All together we succeed|Everyone, I wanted to recognise each of you for all you do when helping out the production support team. It has been another busy year, I for one cannot thank you all enough for everything you do to help out team out. There are countless small things that you all do that really make working here easier. There are countless things that are greatly appreciated and for those things I want to recognise you all. I still find it amazing how despite working across an ocean we have such a great comradery, friendship and can share laughs. I find it phenomenal just how much work we get through and the things we can achieve working side by side are incredible. No matter what we get the support we need and I know that together our team can give our customers a truly world class experience. Thank you all for being you and the teamwork you have displayed over the year. You are all the best :D\n\n241#Outstanding Execution!|Huge congratulations to each of you, for such a successful programme launch for Finastra! As you well know, Finastra signed with us almost exactly a year ago. During the past 12 months, the implementation journey has been challenging, but each of you has demonstrated enormous resilience, patience and expertise. The end result has been a very happy customer and the launch of a new global programme for Finastra's 10,000+ employees. Thanks so much for all your focus on delivering an exceptional experience for this customer!\n\n242#U Create Beauty for UCB|Amazing work everyone at the UCB Design Lab today. We trialed a new deck and everyone stepped up to deliver smoothly, directed great questions to pull out more from the customer, answered even more questions very wisely and comprehensively, and generally steered this customer onto a fast track for success. I see this one only continuing to grow. Well done!\n\n243#Agile opportunity|Matt, I wanted to thank you for stepping up to try a new Agile process including the Azure DevOps tool for implementing one of our newest customers, UCB. Your PMP background is a great foundation for this approach and gives you a heads start on learning on what’s to come while still executing what we need to launch. I also know you’ll be thinking about what, how and why we could potentially utilize parts of the Agile process to enhance our launch process and productivity. Thank you for embracing this opportunity!\n\n244#Back on track|Matt, I was so impressed on our call today with how you to managed to steer a customer right back on track after months of them being unresponsive. Honestly, I thought this was going to be a disaster! But you were straight to the point, set expectations, and set us up for success without even having to push their launch date. Well done!\n\n245#Outstanding Work on Allscripts|Great work by all of you on the Allscripts account of getting it launched and the great early success.  I was on the call with Chris Goff last week and thanked him for his team in a Workhuman event telling participates how great of an experience it has been to work with us.   He told me \"your team earned it as it was a great experience and partnership\"    This is so important as we try to set the right expectations of the people that they will be working with and you all blew them away.  I now have another great reference to use with new prospects.  Thanks for your efforts!\n\n246#Our team makes Caliber's hands clap!|Team,    I cannot thank you enough for the part you played in winning over Caliber Collision Centers senior executives, as well as, pulling off an outstanding Design Lab, in less than a week!  Jen and Corinne, from day 1, you partnered with me to make Caliber comfortable with WH's level of expertise and knowledge.  You throttled the antiquated thinking the executives had about recognition and accelerated a strategic view on how a well designed program will get them the results they are seeking.  Naomi, your smooth delivery and concultative approach helped Caliber shift into overdrive, getting them to think  outside of the box!  Matt and Danielle, you both steared the Caliber team through some of the tricky curves of the design lab, ensuring they will finish the race in record time!    So proud to work with such an amazing team and I cannot wait to see the Caliber executives on stage at Workhuman Live 2021!  They will make Workhuman's hands clap!  Beth\n\n247#Jumping right in...|For my recent time off, we were in critical stages for 2 launches to go live in less than two weeks. I probably didn't express the scope of asking to be my out of office with these specific clients, Matt did not hesitate to support.  Right away, Matt received emails from these clients with their own set of nuances. His knowledge of the product as well as his open communication internally and externally provided relief to me, the team supporting these launches and the client.  Thank you for help!\n\n248#Squats Baby!|When I think of this team, the first thing that comes to mind is Resilience. A close second is Gyshido ;)  You take every customer, every launch, every project to heart to ensure the best experience for the customer and their employees. What others don’t see is that you take on every new project or task with a positive approach and attitude. Are you maxed out with the added workload – yes! Are you constantly prioritizing and re-prioritizing tasks against different customer timelines – yes! Do you have ridiculous customer complexities that are unfathomable – yes! Are you stressed – double yes! Are you trying to help your teammates and colleagues while getting your own work done – yes! Are you balancing work and home – ok…this could be an iffy, lol! But, I see each one of you giving it your best every single day.  I thought this image was awesome because you carry the weight of our customers on your shoulders and you simply just crush it. This team is why I come to work - you all inspire me!\n\n249#On-site for the win!|Matt - thank you for hosting Anne on site yesterday for one of the last meetings you’ll have once YOS launches at Dell next week. It was obvious that she was grateful for the face-to-face time and the time you took to walk her through some of the administrator tasks she’ll be responsible for once their program launches. When you offered to take her on a tour, I could see her eyes light up. I’m certain it was a welcome break from her regular routine and just helped to reinforce our relationship with her. Thank you for inviting me to join you and take over with some questions of my own. It was well worth the extra time and effort for this important client! Great job welcoming her into the WH family!\n\n250#Céad Míle Fáilte|Matt, thanks so much for being so welcoming and trying to plan and coordinate a night out with us and your team while we were over in Framingham. We really appreciate the effort!\n\n251#Helping hand|Matt, I wanted to thank you for supporting my launches while I was on site.  Having you cover my customers always puts my mind at ease, leaving me to be laser-focused on the task at hand.  Knowing that you are covering calls and emails is great confidence for me and I know that customers like Sabre felt the same way.\n\n252#Stepping in and stepping up|Matt- this award is so overdue. Thank you so much for stepping in on the Sabre launch while Rich has been out! During the Award Levels work stream you expertly guided the client away from making a decision that went against our best practice. You were so confident in your approach and because of this they trusted every suggestion you gave them. It can sometimes take this group weeks to make a decision, but you helped to nail down award levels in just one hour! You also willingly stepped in to be a technical resource on the weekly call, which was a big help on a few of their questions. Over the last two weeks you’ve been a huge help every time I’ve slacked you with a question or a  “please help!!” Thank you so much for stepping up to help with this client!\n\n253#Sharing your expertise|Thank you so much for proactively reaching out to Michelle to see if any of the Specialists would benefit from seeing you map a data file starting from scratch. You set up a meeting and went through it with the whole team. I know the team got so much out of it and this will help them with these types of tasks in the future. I love how you have embraced the new team and your willingness to share your expertise to make them better. Thank you for going above and beyond! I appreciate you!\n\n254#Taking Time to Organize|Matt, thanks for taking some time apart from your client work to jump in and organize the files and folders for the Launch team! We all say to ourselves that we're going to 'sort out this' and 'rearrange that' if there were only more hours in the day, and it can be tricky moving at the speed of the customer. Your perspective has helped to strategically organize things into a few folders that make sense - removing redundant and obsolete files, cutting out confusion and preserving consistency and quality. This has not only made things quicker and easier for me but will no doubt help the expanding team of specialists that are starting to learn the launch processes and procedures. Thanks, Matt!\n\n255#Flying in at a moments notice!|Matt, thank you so much for \"flying\" in to keep the momentum moving forward on the BA recognition program.  Monday was a critical Go/No Go review of the project.  Unexpectedly  I was unable to make that call.  I contacted you on Sunday and you were ready and willing to step in.  Keeping the call and ensuring customer confidence in Workhuman as a fully capable team!  Not only did you help out with BA, but in addition to that Unisys had last-minute eligibility changes on launch day.  As always, you reacted, calmly, swiftly and professionally!  You even had to handle a spend management budget question, which you worded so masterfully that I'm going to \"steal\" it and use that in the future.  Thanks for being such a great teammate, keeping the customer always in focus and respecting the urgency of the situation!\n\n256#Second Place in the Scavenger Hunt!!!!!|Team 2!!! Congratulations in coming in 2 place in our Customer Success Offsite Scavenger Hunt! We had a blast going through all of your photos and videos... Leap Frog in the middle of the casino, piling into an elevator, Rock Paper Scissors, all of the Big Papi photos and so much more! Allie, big shout out to you for your photography skills! Way to go team! Glad you had fun! ~Success Squad\n\n257#Customer Success Offsite 2019!!|What an amazing and talented team we have in Customer Success! I am so proud of everything we've accomplished as a team over the past quarter. Thank you Liz, Laura, and Michelle for your creativity and flawless execution of the event from beginning to end - you made the event FUN with odd activities and that was exactly what we needed! Robin and Sharon, thank you for your continued support - your workshop helped the team immensely on how to effectively manage change and it was very well received. Eric - the team was so inspired by your session that they kicked off the Gratitude Movement beyond the Workplace at Foxwoods itself (see video)! And thank you to the entire Customer Success team for your active engagement and contribution throughout the event - this event was special because of YOU, and I am so grateful that we are a team!! Thank you, All...\n\n258#Proactive and glowing customer feedback|Who doesn’t love proactive and glowing customer feedback?! Leslie Bingham, Dover Fueling Solutions’ PM, reached out to me to share how much she and the team have enjoyed working with you, Matt. “Matt’s insight and tailored guidance was integral to us having a successful launch! He was very responsive, kept us on track yet was flexible, he is a consummate professional, and just an overall pleasure to work with! Not to mention, he is incredibly smart. I kind of hated for the program to launch because I knew it meant we wouldn’t be working with Matt anymore!” On top of that she also offered to be a reference for you and/or Workhuman for potential clients. Double whammy! What a spectacular impression to make at the start of the relationship as they set sail on their program success. Congratulations on the accolades!\n\n259#We don't talk anymore|Matt,  We've joked that South Shore Health is our unicorn client, the one that comes to the table prepared and empowered to make decisions, that views us as a true partner and makes our weekly project meeting a joy to attend (really). We barely needed to talk because everything flowed so smoothly. While the preparations that the clients make play a large part in this, it really is a testament to the strength of the relationship you build with South Shore Health and the guidance you provided to help ensure their launch went so smoothly. It was clear from day one at the Design Lab that they were reassured and comforted by your presence.  This was also evident on the handover call today, Lisa and Susan, the program manager and main contacts were overflowing with praise for our partnership, your role and also, rightfully proud that they were able to launch on time with the small amount of resources that they had.   They commented specifically that they would miss their Wednesday project calls with you, which I think is a first for me hearing that from a client.   So on behalf of the South Shore Health team, both client and Workhuman side, I'm sending you a \"High Five\" award. Lisa mentioned specifically thanks for \"making the last several months of design, planning, and testing so well orchestrated and thoughtful.\"  She followed with, \"You represent the epitome of what a cohesive team looks like. We couldn’t have asked for better teammates, and we deeply appreciate your encouragement and guidance along the way to get us to this big day. We truly enjoyed working with all of you!\"  We've got one mutual launch under our belts, here's to many more that flow just as smoothly!\n\n260#Outstanding Design Lab!|A massive thank you to each of you for delivering such an energetic and insightful Design Lab! Lynette, a special mention to you for making the long trek and for having a laser like focus on engaging with everyone, even those attending remotely. In truth, each of you did a fantastic job and the reaction from Isabelle and the SNC team, shows just how solid a relationship you've forged over these past few months - you truly are trusted advisors and it's clear from their email feedback, that SNC is genuinely excited to partner with us on their recognition journey. Thank you for executing this critical meeting so well!\n\n261#Inspirational at South Shore Health|Joyce, Matt, and Robyn - congrats on an amazing launch and launch day at South Shore Health. I had the opportunity to interact with many of their executive leadership including their CEO, CFO, CHRO, VP of Quality Management, and VP of Operational Excellence, and they were all so enthusiastic and fully participatory in their launch events. I had the opportunity to have 1on1 time with their CHRO; he was so appreciative of the work you've done to support his Experience & Engagement Officer, Lisa, and her entire team.  He told me, it may have taken 3 years working on him, but he's very happy we stuck with him and his team. I also had the opportunity to have lunch with Lisa and she had nothing, but wonderful things to say about \"her team.\" Even before they went live she sent me this quote \"I need to express my kudos for being a highly impressive, and cohesive team. I’ve been involved in many large “launches” and by far your organized and passionate approach is the best I’ve ever encountered. My team all commented on how impressed they were with you all, and how relieved they feel to know we have solid support. In our fast-paced, and unpredictable healthcare roles - it’s comforting to know we have a solid backing to achieve the goals of this project.\"  And as a continued testament to the work you've done she's put in a good word into a former colleague who is now the CHRO at Artius Health (one of Scott Appleton's accounts), and during lunch she also told me we're excited about implementing the rest of the Workhuman Cloud over the next few years!  She also reiterated her thanks for us sticking with them and said, once the Gallup Engagement Surveys came back last year she knew all the work they did in previous years would pay off even if they had to implement before going live with Workday (our IT/payroll team knew it would be well worth the effort knowing what the future could hold).  Awesome job!!!\n\n262#Successful Design Lab @ Signature HealthCARE!|Today, I witnessed a quote in action \"Teamwork divides the tasks and multiplies the success\". Each of you played a pivotal role in ensuring a successful design lab at Signature HealthCARE. Robyn, you kicked us off to a great start with setting the context and facilitating an ice-breaker exercise that got the client team and us all warmed up for the day. Naomi - your brilliant facilitation around the program strategy, ambitions and the change management approach enabled client team to appreciate the nuances of our partnership and ensured them that we are here for their success. Matt - your strong grasp on the program structure details and your ability to lead the client team through program levels, and budget discussions was spectacular. Maggie - your preparation and facilitation of the program brand brainstorming exercise was highly engaging and resulted in some great ideas for the program brand. Great job everyone! Each of your hard work and commitment to client success resulted in a very productive workshop.\n\n263#Sotera Support Society|Matt - let's be honest: looking through seven (sort of six...well sort of 5) different Years of Service structures for a client you haven't been involved and have very little context on first thing Friday morning was probably NOT the most exciting thing you've ever done. All that said, I so appreciate you doing it! Your fresh eyes caught things (big things!) my tired ones were missing in the configuration, and helped make sure we righted the ship before we the client live in a week. Thank you for your brain, your help, and your moral support.\n\n264#Launch Aficionado!|Matt, it is very clear that you've had a massive impact on your recent new launches, especially Dover Fueling Solutions. So much so that on our most recent weekly project call our PM stated that this has been THE BEST launch experience she has ever been a part of. One of Dover's partner companies is closing in on signing a contract with us, and you've done such a stellar job that you've been requested to be the LSM when they are ready to launch. \"We want them to have the same exact launch experience we've had, you've just been so great,\" a direct quote from Dover's project team! You make it a true partnership for our clients, and they are always set up for success. Keep up the great work, we're incredibly lucky to have you at Workhuman!\n\n265#Calm Under Pressure|Matt - I think this picture probably summarizes how you were feeling last night on your late call.  Although I was only privy to your half of the discussion (since I was eavesdropping and don't even know what client you were on with), it was clearly a difficult conversation to lead.   You remained calm and very clear with your messaging. You really showed how we can be a good partner, even when things might be going back to the drawing board.  Fingers crossed that this will turn around so you can continue your amazing leadership with their recognition journey.\n\n266#New customer singing your praises!|Matt & Alex - great job building a fantastic relationship with Lisa over at South Shore Health! I met her at the Customer Cocktail Hour on Tuesday down in Nashville, and she was singing your praises. Matt - the conversation with Lisa at the table was so engaging when you joined us. You were attentive, very gently guided the conversation to the naming of their platform and other launch related things, but also spent time just speaking with her as another HUMAN about non-work related things as well. Alex - Lisa made a point of saying how much she enjoyed working with you throughout the sales process. She said of all the vendors she's spoken to over the years, you were SO attentive and  helpful, without being that \"pushy salesman\" she's used to. Awesome work to both of you for kicking off this new partnership the right way!\n\n267#Lounge Lizards|Thank you all so much for your hard work and customer delight in the lounge this year! I just knew you were all the best humans for the role and you did not disappoint. From managing the room, being on time, setting up raffles, answering questions all the way to sourcing additional bottles of water - you are all rock stars. Thanks for making this the best year of the lounge to date! Our customers appreciate you and so do I.\n\n268#Design Lab at South Shore Health|This was my first Design Lab and I got to see Joyce Silvia and Matt Gillen in action - wow, these two are incredible!! Everything from the pre-meeting prep, smooth delivery of the presentation, Joyce's creative branding brainstorm (check out the names) to Matt's surprise lobster lollipops (don't ask!) for the Customer's 16th anniversary was so carefully thought out so much so that Lisa Rabideau, Experience and Engagement Officer, sent the following note \"I need to express my kudos for being a highly impressive, and cohesive team. I've been involved in many large launches and by far your organized and passionate approach is the best I've ever encountered. My team all commented on how impressed they were with you all, and how relieved they feel to know we have solid support. In our fast paced, and unpredictable healthcare roles - it's comforting to know we have a solid backing to achieve the goals of this project.\" Huge thank you to Alex Paz for building a strong relationship with the customer over the years, and to Robyn MacDougall and Daniel Forest for their active engagement and support throughout the session.\n\n269#Teamwork makes the Dreamwork!|I just want to say thank you Matt for how great you have been to work with on the Finastra project. We have barely even begun the process but you have been so understanding and accommodating of our teams workload and have done everything you can to make our job as easy and stress free as you can and I really appreciate it. Its such a great example of seamless teamwork which ensures our clients get the best work from us. Thank you so much! =D\n\n270#Check and Check|Matt, thanks for helping me give the email templates and launch checklist a face lift. You have a great perspective to simplify, simplify, simplify, which is exactly what they each need. Both processes are going to set the entire launch team up for better support of our newest clients moving forward. Even though we just scratched the surface with each this week, we made significant progress on both documents which is going to be wildly beneficial for us and our clients. I look forward to seeing what the end results will be!\n\n271#Launching into 2019|Thank you team, for a fantastic offsite as we had a 2018 year in review and then a look towards 2019. You all brought your whole selves on self reflection, process improvements, customer relationships and management and personal growth. I’m excited for the year ahead and the strides we’ll make as a team to be the best yet! I love being a part of this team.  And a special thanks to Shawn...for your help in the logistics, your design insight and my co-chef!\n\n272#UAT made easy!|Matt, I just wanted to highlight how well you introduced UAT to our friends at Schindler today. Although it’s outside my lane, you were kind enough to invite me so that I could better understand this experience for our customers. I’ve been a part of many UATs in my previous life and this was certainly one of the easiest, most organized UAT explanations I’ve seen presented. We’re lucky to have a platform that’s easy to use and UAT scripts that are prepared in an organized fashion, so you could have just given them a 5 minute intro to explain and sent them on their way. Instead, you took the time to walk them through each step - demoing the login instructions, walking them through the flow of the scripts, calling out areas where you’ve seen customers get stuck before and the criticality of the mobile process for testing. I think they’re quite energized and excited to test and that’s thanks to your clear and informative instructions. Thank you for your Respect for Customers and preparing the Schindler team so well!\n\n273#SNC-Lavalin & Link Group Design Labs|A massive thanks to you Matt for helping lead such a successful Design Lab with the SNC team in London! It was a team effort, however, you played a pivotal role and your deep knowledge and experience was key in helping us guide the SNC team towards a successful plan. I'm looking forward to working with you over the coming months and building on your successful start to our partnership with this important client. Thanks also for your leadership on the Link Group's implementation as well - we're off to a very strong start and that's down to you! Thanks a mill!\n\n274#Bravo! on the FCS launch|Great work on launching Farm Credit Services of America Bravo Program. They are very excited to have a new, modern, approach to recognition. This will undoubtedly help us expand our presence in the Omaha HR community. Thanks for all the hard work these past few months!\n\n275#Here to pump YOU up!|Rich and Matt - AKA the Hans and Franz of the Launch team!? All week you guys have helped me gear up for the avalanche of launches by answering my questions, walking me through processes, answering MORE questions, and providing tips and tricks that I wouldn't have picked up only one month in. A big thank you to making my ramp up a fast, fun and well-organized one!\n\n276#Free estimates!|Guys, I wanted to commend you both and thank you so much for each taking time out of your day when I had questions regarding the average hours a client needs to put aside on their end for launch, implementation, etc. You both were instrumental in helping me (and Matt) understand what the averages are, how it all typically works (weekly, by persona, etc.), and what goes into those multiple weeks/months so I could successfully get back to our prospect win detail with the answers to their questions. Also, each of you said you'd be more than happy to jump on a quick call with me and the prospect to answer their questions if needed and knowing how busy you guys are, the offer means a great deal. All the information you both provided me on each occasion was incredible and I appreciate the teamwork!\n\n277#From the Farm (Credit Service) to the Syniverse|Matt, thank you for your assistance and support with our two most recent UATs. With FCS, you were quick to jump in an handle UAT when I was unexpectedly out of the office, which I truly appreciated. With Syniverse, I thought we worked great together. I appreciate your collaboration and that you were willing and trusting to let me take these pieces and run with them, even though I know you are always there for support if I need it. Thanks for being a great teammate!!\n\n278#Go team!!|Hi everyone. I wanted to take a moment to recognize the fantastic work that you guys have carried out in 2018. This was a very busy year with a lot of big launches - (Dell immediately comes to mind) and I know it was certainly challenging at times! However I feel that due to the strong partnership that exists across our teams, we have delivered excellence consistently for our customers. Speaking for my team, I would like to say that we value all of your hard work and we could not ask for a nicer bunch of people to work hand in hand with. I hope that our partnership continues to grow from strength to strength in 2019 and that our customers continue to benefit from the collective determination shown. Thank you all for a great 2018 and I hope to see you all for a celebratory drink in Dublin in January!  Thanks!\n\n279#They couldn’t ask for a better partner|Matt, great job throwing together an in person on site meeting with the Olympus team while they were in Southboro. We assumed the meeting would be about UAT but it ended up truly being a collaboration session. Shannon and Gwenn each had a ton of clarification questions that came up during their executive meeting this morning and you guided them in a nurturing an consultative way. Towards the end of the day, Shannon said that it was a much needed meeting, that she couldn’t ask for better partners in their recognition journey, and they were so glad they were able to join us at the office. It was clear that Shannon and Gwenn have a lot of trust in you and that you have invested heavily to build a relationship with Olympus!\n\n280#Cookies = Love|There is no better feeling than seeing a customer share the following message after getting their launch cookies about all of you, \"Thank you so much for sending us the cookies with the RISE logo.  We absolutely LOVE them! We are very grateful for all of your support with the launch of RISE. The program would not have been possible without your guidance and expertise.  The level of customer service was truly first class and you all went above and beyond to ensure this was a successful and quality program.  What most resonates with me is how you were always positive and encouraging when we (Schindler Team) couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.  You all always kept us going!  We look forward to our continued partnership!\" Well done on building the foundation for this partnership team!\n\n281#Launch + LinkedIn = SUCCESS|Team, thank you for letting me join your pod today to review LinkedIn best practices and review the what, when, where, why of updating your profile, sharing/liking posts and the importance of helping elevate our recruiting efforts, which in turn elevates our employer brand. For those that attended our LI Office Hours to those \"re-upping\" today - we greatly appreciate your participation and support! With your help, we look forward to spreading the word far-and-wide for your team openings!\n\n282#RISEing above it all for SEC|Great job guys getting everything ready for the launch of Schindler USA on 11/1!  Over the course of the last three months I have heard countless times from the client how great you both were to ensure this happened on time!  And there were more than a few hurdles - 1. lets add the quality program for USA 2. what you mean the resource center is mine to use, can't you just help, and 3. What do you mean Schindler group invented a new repair robot and named it RISE?  That ledge was one which the client almost lept from but you guys were there to back her up and ensure that no matter what happened we survived and hit SEC's launch date!  well done guys.  The client loves you both and will be a great reference!\n\n283#RISE to the occasion|We raise a glass to your first launch with Schindler Elevator's RISE Program! Today was the culmination of all your knowledge and learnings you’ve gained and internalized over these past 7 months. Anyone who has heard you lead Schindler through the process would never know this was your first launch – including the client! You were thoughtful, deliberate and patient working with a tactical PM who was striving for a strategic mindset. I look forward to many more launches and your journey of leading customers to success! Congratulations Matt!\n\n284#On the ball!|Matt just want to give you a big shout out. I've been working on a couple of projects with you recently and your communication, quickness to respond with any info and in general just always being on ball is really appreciated. The projects run so smoothly for me because of your efficiency so thanks a mill. Always a pleasure to work with!\n\n285#RISEing to the Occasion!|Matt, nobody would ever know that Schindler Elevator was your first launch client.  ESPECIALLY not the client PM who on a call today after final testing said \"Matt, this goes without saying, but you and the entire Globoforce team have been incredible and we have NO complaints whatsoever.  You are an amazing project manager and did a great job keeping us all on schedule and letting us know what was coming next- and I have something to learn from you.  Everything was amazing and we really appreciate all of your hard work!\".  I wrote this down as she was saying it so I could capture the words she used.  AMAZING! Congrats!!!\n\n286#Making the complex simple|Matt – Once again I’m totally floored by your skills and depth of knowledge. Overhearing you deal with a tricky conversation around point rounding for a client who decided to use .10 per point over our standard .5 was excellent. You walked the client through a technical explanation on why they were seeing differences in gift cards from what was communicated in the sales process. You did this in a way that was clear and easy to understand which is so important when you are delivering this type of information. You are a huge asset to our team! Keep up the great work.\n\n287#EXCEL-lent teammates|Thank you so much for your Excel help over the last couple of weeks! I have had several advanced requests from Dell that require some urgency and you both have been available at the drop of a hat to help me figure it all out. Not only do you do this with a smile, you take the extra time to explain the detail of what you are recommending so I can do this on my own in the future. You are both so talented and helpful and I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to jump in!\n\n288#You are officially redeemed|Matt - I can't thank you enough for lending your spectacular Excel skills to create multiple budget templates for Dell! They had some requirements that were extremely specific to their organization that can't be met by the Spend Management tool. Though a budget template might seem like a simple thing on the surface, this particular scenario required hours upon hours of your time to understand the requirements, brainstorm on the best solution, and ultimately implement the complicated formulas. And you did this all with your usual positive attitude. Thanks so much for being such a wonderful teammate and for sharing your expertise!\n\n289#Wait, you've been here how long??|Matt, first of all, thank you for letting me shadow (aka lurk in the background) some of the new client project, intro and kick-off calls recently. This is really helpful as I continue to learn about all the decisions and activities that are key to a successful customer launch. That being said, I wanted to highlight how well you manage each discussion with clients and your effort to respect each of their nuances as an organization. Specifically during yesterday's call with Syniverse, you took the opportunity to identify their spike in new hires in 2017 meant \"rapid growth\" and this population would really benefit from a three-year anniversary award ultimately reassuring the program team that they were moving toward an impactful decision. When they had questions about award levels, you were quick to create an example on screen to visualize how they can make it work for their organization. Additionally, having invited some of their payroll specialists, you were sure to point out the importance of their attendance and reviewed a payroll file in detail with them which I imagine made them feel their time was put to good use. Lastly, I would be remiss to mention that on another client call earlier this week, the customer enthusiastically mentioned that your confidence in the project plan made her feel much more comfortable with the process and that the launch was sure to be a success. Listening to your delivery of key messages and your level of confidence during each call really made me think you had been working for Globoforce for years, so job well done!! You truly have a great way of genuinely becoming an extension of each client's program team!\n\n290#Look out for Kcuhc|Matt- Thank you for fielding my client's sso call while I was out on vacation. I truly appreciate how our team is so willing to jump in and help when needed. Your efforts allowed me to have a great time with family and gave me piece of mind knowing you had it handled.   Bonus! - You made friends with Kcuhc!\n\n291#Keeping the ball rolling!|Matt, thank you for watching over PVH and Korn Ferry, while I was out for a couple of days.  PVH had some last minute UAT items and Korn Ferry's data team required some key information.  You delivered on both, keeping both projects moving forward, showing each customer that Globoforce is their partner and progress does not stop because one team member is unavailable.  Because of your efforts, I was able to truly enjoy my time off with my family celebrating my son's 13th birthday in NYC.  Thank you for being such a great teammate!\n\n292#Super Call with a Trick Client|Thank you so much Matt for coming on a call with me this week with Olympus. These guys are a bit disorganised but you were so great at pulling them back into line with such a calm yet positive manner. It was such a great help in getting them to focus and will really help in getting these guys to sort themselves out and come back to us with a solid plan. I really appreciated having a great ally =D\n\n293#Awesome collaborator|Matt- Thank you for enthusiastically helping me get my thoughts together and peppering in your own thoughts and ideas as I am evaluating tools.  Your prior experience doing this is encouraging to me, and I have been able to swivel around and ask you questions when I get stuck and you have provided great advice. I really appreciate your positive attitude and forward-thinking as we go down this path, and I know I will be relying on you more as we implement!\n\n294#Crushing It!|Matt - I had the pleasure of sitting in on one of your weekly project calls and I am blown away at how far you've come. In something like 7 months, you've internalized understanding on a huge array of topics. Showing mastery of the technical, strategic, and soft skills needed to build relationships and guide your clients through a successful launch.You do such a wonderful job of balancing all the different needs and requirements with your own personal style and levity. Your future here is bright and we are so lucky to have you on our team! I cannot wait to see what you accomplish in the next few years.\n\n295#Stellar Demo Skills|Matt, I wanted to acknowledge the awesome demo you gave this morning! I overheard that that wasn't quite the plan for this call. You swept right in and delivered a fantastic presentation of the platform. I really enjoyed listening to how you spoke with the customer, informed them of every important aspect employee experience, and thoughtfully answered their questions. Fantastic work!! Customer Success is lucky to have a great LSM like yourself setting our customers up for success and a positive relationship!\n\n296#A series of small things...|Trying to be funny, I was searching for a cheesy teamwork poster to include on this award. I ended up coming across this one with the following quote: \"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" If this is not applicable to our team right now, I don't know what is! You have each jumped in without a single hesitation to help with Dell, Edwards, and PwC over the past couple of weeks - config changes, data file loads, slides, Jira tickets, and more. All of the things that might seem like just one little task or project all add up and are having a big impact to these clients. And for me personally, it just reminds me (literally daily) how lucky I am to work with such an amazing, caring group of people. Thank you so much for being amazing teammates and helping me get through.\n\n297#It's Really Happening!|Matt! Congrats on running your first handover and intro call. You did an excellent job both representing Globoforce and making the client feel comfortable with the process. I can already tell you are going to be a true pro at this in not time. Your calm demeanor and clear way of explaining the details make you an invaluable part of this team and our organization!\n\n298#A Game for AB|Matt - I can't say enough about how HUGE of a help you've been with the AllianceBernstein launch. An email comes in, and 30 seconds later you're at my desk asking how you can help, proposing next steps, and ready to tackle the next challenge. Your quality has shown through in EVERY task I've asked you to do, and more over in the tasks I haven't asked you to do, but you've taken on just because you want to. Config doc? All set. UAT Scripts? No problem. Data file mapping? You're on it. Your desire to learn, and the attention to the details, does not go unnoticed. And your willingness to take on any task and ask questions you think will help you better understand the product, the system, the talk track shines through.   AMAZING job! Thanks for bring your A game to the team and to this client!\n\n299#BP Praise|Matt thank you for your helping with the BP YOS testing. Richard Sinclair of said and I quote \"Again such fantastic support from Globoforce!\" He is clearly pleased with that the test scripts that you created, making it very easy for them to breeze through the validation process ahead of schedule. Great job!!\n\n300#Launching success|This past week, each and every one of you has done something amazing to support my clients. Configuration work, managing SOLI tables, following up to make sure branding and SSO were moving forward, answering client questions, taking unexpected meetings...those are just some of the examples of things that you did. What makes these contributions particularly special is that none of you even paused or hesitated to jump in. It means so much to me. It is a truly special thing to work with people who you know will be there for you, and I hope you know that I would do the same for each of you in a heartbeat. I love working with you guys and I cannot tell you how incredibly lucky I feel to be part of this amazing team. Thank you so much for being the best teammates I could ever ask for.\n\n301#Wait, Wait GO!|Shawn, Matt, Sarah, Slava, thank you so much for jumping into action, sprinting to the finish line in record time.  While Lonza has been a customer, in Launch for some time now, due to a number of circumstances they have been slow to engage with the final design of their bravo! recognition program.  However, they have been recently motivated by the business with a desire for population expansion prior to launch.  Now that there are more eyes on the project, we have been asked to display the user experience on a working site in just a few days, to their Head of Talent.  Lonza has asked us to complete the site and prep it as soon as possible.  Sarah you jumped right in getting the branding applied, Shawn and Matt you both searched, hunted and scoured the site for all instances of \"title case\" replacing with \"proper case\" and Slava, you preformed a detailed  QA of the site ensuring our demo will be polished and ready for the customer review. After the demo completed today, Lonza's Head of Talent expressed how easy the site was to use and how excited he was to get this program launched.  A BIG Thank You to each of you!\n\n302#Top Dogs|Matt & Shawn – Thank you so much for all the help in getting Husky off the ground! Both of your work to generate their catch up WbOW was integral to the success and adoption of this launch. In addition to that, all the help with QA bugs and SOLI’s help make this a smooth take off!   I've been blown away by our team's efforts over the past few months and you two are big part of out success. I can't wait to see what comes next! GO LAUNCH!\n\n303#Detailed demo|Matt- Great job on your first demo! I could tell you put in a great amount of work into figuring out exactly what you wanted to say and where you wanted to go next, and you were able to field questions like a pro.  I look forward to seeing you succeed in your career here at Globoforce. Nice work!\n\n304#Above & Beyond @ AB Design|Great work today team in making team Brevinicci’s newest customer feel a welcome part of the Globoforce team!  Each of you pulled your weight and excelled during today’s design lab which ensured AB is even more excited today then when they signed!  Well done\n\n305#My Go-To|Matt, thanks for being my new go-to. You have actively sought out and offered to take on some of my tasks over the past couple weeks to learn about config and the launch process. The tasks I’ve sent your way have included some configuration work, some translations, and a few ad hoc requests. I know when I send something your way, I can trust you to complete it in a timely manner and that the work will be done to my expectations in terms of quality. Any questions you have are well thought out. I’ve been super impressed by your eagerness to learn and the general quality of the work you turn out. I think it is a true foreshadowing of the LSM you are becoming!\n\n306#Launching into 2018|What a great day we had at our offsite and that is thanks to each one of you! We had fresh ideas and revised approaches to tackling some of our biggest challenges during launch. I appreciate everyone’s unique perspective and when you put them altogether, we strengthen our processes to provide our customers with the best program, launch experience and partnership. I look forward to a successful year ahead of us with this amazing team!\n\n"
