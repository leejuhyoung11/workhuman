"0#Energized for bp|Kylie, as we close out 2022 and move into a brand new year of opportunities and challenges, I wanted to reach out and give a huge thank you for all you have done at bp.  As we struggled through Covid with bp, we always believed they'd get back to stellar status at some point.  This was the year.  Not only did they take our suggestions and implement higher dollar awards, Life Events and Conversations with Reflections, which in and of itself is a beast, it happened seemlessly (at least for the customer).  The immense and intense amount of work and follow up that went into the focus@bp project would be too much for some, but not for you.  Your attention to detail and to the satisfaction of bp truly is above and beyond.  And still, you are relentless in the follow up on all the outstanding items.  I see the gratefullness from Kerryn every time we are on a call.  You have helped her look like a superstar to her management and there is no better position to be in with a PM.  You are amazing, a true superstar and it's appreciated every day.  Looking forward to many more wins in 2023!  Enjoy your time off and Happy Holidays.\n\n1#Thank you|Thank you all for the amazing work you do each day & the wonderful ambassadors and advocates you are for our customers, both internally & externally. I greatly admire your energy, can do attitude, passion and am privileged to work with the talented indidivuals that you are.  I hope you get a chance to relax and recharge in the coming week and look forward to a fantastic 2023.\n\n2#Thanks for a JOLLY good time!|Jose, thank you for organizing the luncheon in Dublin yesterday - it was so great to have the opportunity to meet face to face with all the folks on our team.  Appreciate the holiday touches - the decorations, the treats and the Christmas tradition theme to get the group sharing stories!  I loved getting to hear each of your stories and learning about Irish traditions.  You've all been so welcoming, and I'm looking forward to continuing to support each of you.  Wish you all the best as you wrap up the year, and hope you get time to settle down and recharge over the next two weeks.\n\n3#Appreciate the help|Thank you so much for participating in usability testing for the Award Management. Your feedback was crucial to help identify usability issues, and it will go a long way to improve the user experience and ensure better outcomes in the Admin experience. Appreciate you giving me your precious time. Thanks again 😊\n\n4#Launching Annual reflections for bp|December 1, 2022, was the long-awaited day Workhuman would launch Annual reflections for bp. Proud to say, \"Mission accomplished!\" Over 37K bp employees now have access to Reflections. You participate in the remarkable group of humans behind bp's Annual reflection. We got the program across the finish line using effective communication, collaboration, transparency, and thought leadership. The goal we achieved in this program design is to display the power behind Conversations through Reflections and how companies can use a human-centric approach to performance reviews.    This launch started in June 2022. When I spoke with the PM Wednesday afternoon, she was thrilled and grateful for Workhuman's partnership throughout the implementation cycle. Thank you for being so dedicated to excellence.    Important note: the release of the Annual reflections is the second Reflections launch in a month. Well done, team!!!\n\n5#Bringing Customers needs to Design!|Thanks so much, guys for helping us with the research on Admin X, it was really useful and powerful, you have definitely impact the design of the product in a great way, this is what I call Team Work ;D\n\n6#Season of Giving Your All|This past week, all of you came together to share in the commitment to our customers, our company and each other!  It was so inspiring to see each and every one of you show up with passion and a desire to collectively learn from each other.  We spent time building momentum around how we unlock doors with executives, gaining full adoption of the Workhuman cloud, reaching new users on the platform, increasing investment and renewing our vows with longstanding customers.  The engagement that I saw when we discussed the roles everyone plays in supporting our customers, how you partner together and the achievements that have come from those partnerships was profound.  As we often hear, it takes a village - well I'm so PROUD to be a part of this village.  The commitment demonstrated in these sessions together is what makes us great and will continue to lead us into a bright 2023, no matter the challenges, we have each other!  In the spirit of the season of giving, thank you for giving it your all.  I look forward to more time together and a huge cheers to all of you!\n\n7#Blowing Them Away at bp|From the moment we set the Strategic Review appointment, this team went into action!  From prep meetings, to marathon prep meetings :), to last minute changes and updates and review after review this team gave everything to this 3+ hour session with bp! (and then a wonderful dinner).  With 3 VP's and several team members from bp in the room, everyone took their role very seriously and came out shining!  Reviewing the entire WH Cloud, pulling together a cohesive presentation on Recognition and Conversations (focus@bp) was a challenge taken on and crushed by this team.  Jennifer, welcome to the NFL (a term a fomer boss of mine used to describe the tough, big calls that come off so successfully).  Walking into a client that all of us have worked with for years, as the new kid on the block, you were amazing.  So comfortable and \"at home\" in discussing their current stats as well as what is to come.  Your enthusiasm shone through.  Lynette, a true pro, you contributed your weath of knowledge and your understanding of bp.  Pivoting on a dime when need be and jumping in with prime examples when needed.  Such amazing, hard and triumphant work.  Alan, you fit right in even from miles away.  Data is a tough one at bp but we got them to leave a door open to work with us.  Your presentation was insightful and intriguing.  You had everyone in the room captivated.  Greg, thanks for your expertise on the prep calls. Invaluable.  Kylie, what can I say?  Through the years, through the highs and the \"not so highs\" (lol), you and I have been the dynamic duo (for all the batman references made at dinner last night).  You have been an outstanding, amazing, wonderful partner and friend.  Working tirelessly on this account and responding to all their day to day needs.  You are spectacular.  A true superstar and I am truly GRATEFUL to have you there beside me every, single day.  Thanks to all!  WE BLEW THEM AWAY!!\n\n8#Unleash|Guil & Kylie thank you both for attending Unleash in Paris. It was great to hear about the customer discussions that you had and the insights gleaned which would not have been learned remotely. I appreciate the dual roles you played while attending the conference and ensuring that the regular work got done for your customers. We are lucky to have such wonderful Workhuman ambassdors & advocates, great work & thank you!\n\n9#AstraZeneca Avengers|All - When the CEO of AZ said, \"help me understand what I get for this investment\" before I sign this renewal, this team answered the call. Everyone assembled quickly and put together a plan to help the HR Executives put together the story to present to him.  Paul, you have been battling to get this renewal done for quite some time. Your focus on moving the ball forward and making sure AZ is in the strategic zone has been remarkable. Jesse, Greg, and Alan, thank you all for pulling together all the data, making it a quick turnaround and helping us to understand the story we could tell was so appreciated.  Traci, Kylie, Melissa and Jessica, huge kudos to all of you for bringing the story to life, not just delivering the data impactfully but also artfully. It was a privilege to get to watch you all spring into action and conquer this challenge head on. Magnificent work all!\n\n10#CSM and Research chat|Kylie, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to Jelena and myself. We really enjoyed our chat with you and both learned so much about you and your team. Legend!\n\n11#Success has many parents....|A huge, huge thank you to everyone involved in making the launch of the new Workhuman iQ application happen. We started a month ago with a request from an early access customer and in four weeks have built an end-to-end application incorporating machine learning through semantic search and a beautiful user experience. It's been challenging and everyone on the Workhuman iQ application team has been an absolute hero, rolling their sleeves up and navigating past every obstacle with determination and positivity. We've learned a massive amount and I'm looking forward to us applying those lessons for future work by ourselves and others.   We couldn't have got into production without help from the DBAs and Wizards (Kostas has been an absolute legend and Richie enabled us to validate that everything was working at the last). Massive thanks to our colleagues in Product and to Nuvs, Greg Hippmann and Kylie for helping us understand and navigate privileges and the config app. Well done to everyone involved in this enormous achievement. To go from where we were ~4 weeks ago to this result today is absolutely mind-blowing. I couldn't be prouder to work with you all.\n\n12#Driving Syngenta expansion with Chem China group!|Kylie - terrific leadership and work in guiding the (former) Chem China group at Syngenta to (finally) take steps to join the Val-You program (hopefully by the end of the year!). Your efforts, thoughtfulness, and wise counsel to the China team has already made them comfortable with the idea of the ease of expansion and ready for the next step of thinking through Design Lab to make the best decisions for a program structure that works for Chinese employees within the Val-You platform. Kudos to you and well done on this important client expansion!\n\n13#Thank you Conversation Power Team and Awesome CSMs|Today is day 90 of my employment and onboarding at Workhuman. As I reflect on these last few months, I am overwhelmed with immense gratitude for each of you- for your ongoing support, education, mentoring, patience and kindness.  Tiffany, thank you for the engaging onboarding enablement training sessions! Robyn, Mark, Bryant, Kylie, Rachel and Mike- thank you for educating me about your clients as I transition to add support and value for their Conversations platform. Patrick, thank you for being my buddy and allowing me to shadow client calls, to be part of strategic product roadmap discussions, and ask all sorts of questions!  Lynette and Kim, thank you for sharing your valuable insights on Workhuman's Performance Management Comms and Trends! Jose, thank you for your incredible support and guidance from day 1! And Diarmuid, Gavin and Michelle- thank you for responding to my many slack messages and for inviting me to learn all things Conversations and Reflections!  And to Kel!!  Thank you so very much for the day in, day out amazing support you give to me as we work together on the 3 client Reflection launches and more!! It is a fabulous experience to see you in action as you lead these projects!   I am so honored to be in this new role as a CSM for Conversations and look forward to continued collaboration and teamwork with you all!\n\n14#ooo|Thanks so much to you both for supporting my clients while I was ooo. I really appreciate you both jumping in to tackle numerous client queries, award testing and keeping projects on track for the week. It was really great to be able to switch off knowing they were in safe hands. Huge thanks again.\n\n15#Always above and beyond|Kylie, this is well overdue but I wanted to attempt to show my appreciation for all the help and support you have offered on a range of things recently.  Nothing is ever too much and your thoroughness in getting to the bottom of things and commitment to quality for the customer is something we can all strive for.\n\n16#Above & Beyond for Teva|Kylie above and beyond doesn't do this justice but thank you for all your work and partnership with Teva as they wind down their program.  You are working closely with the customer, with Legal, InfoSec, Operations and many others across the company to ensure you can support this customer and address their queries comprehensively.  You have really helped move the needle on their redemptions and thank you for all your efforts and collaboration with teams on this. All of your work on this is hugely appreciated!\n\n17#Steady Stewardship for AZ|Kylie, sometimes is not one big moment but a steady series of keeping an important client on even keel that is worth highlighting. One may think a client relationship is always smooth sailing, but it's really due to a strong captain like you at the helm. I've called it out before, but you have a knack of bringing all hands on deck across our internal teams to ensure everything with AZ's account is shipshape, whether it's collaborating with Workhuman iQ to ensure we're on the right tack, battening down the hatches as we encounter tough issues (recognition in China!) or convincing AZ to embrace rocking the boat with something new, Inclusion Advisor.  You run a tight ship, and I'm part to be on board as a part of your AZ crew! In all seriousness (and puns aside), in the two years supporting AZ,  you always impress me with your organized and coordinated approach to meeting AZ's needs while skillfully guiding them to where they need to be. It is noticed, even though I don't always get a chance to call it out.\n\n18#brilliant partner (bp) excellence!|Kylie, a tremendous shout of awe and appreciation for your leadership of bp, especially this year as they've expanded their recognition program (with more exciting changes to come) and added Conversations to nearly all employees globally! 👏 With your stewardship and partnership, we're also seeing recognition activity return to pre-Covid levels. Just look at these numbers... in just the first 8 weeks of Conversations and new Recognition features being live, people are engaging at record pace! Thanks to you, bp people are connecting with each other every 18 seconds. Truly stellar! Thank you!\n\n19#Huddle Up!!!|Traci, Corbrina and Kylie were responsive and helpful in today's Customer Strategy Huddle. They jumped at the chance to be presenters to the team with little notice. Corbrina did a great job presenting on LinkedIn's platform. I appreciate your last minute help.\n\n20#Inclusion Advisor & Reflections Live at LinkedIn|Kylie thank you for the pivotal role you played on this project, I am borrowing your own words when you share that \"There is no doubt LinkedIn are visionaries and trailblazers, but it truly takes stamina, determination and a dream team to secure strategic buy in and deliver new initiatives seamlessly. LinkedIn Leadership loved this tool and believe it will be a significant part of incorporating their DIBs objectives into all that they do, not just in Bravo.\"   From the outset you worked closely with Carol and the LI team and internally with Corbrina, nuvs & Traci & others to address their questions, bring the right people together and show the value of this product and then ensuring that we did go live to a pilot group on Wednesday last week.  Thank you for your commitment to LinkedIn and your strong collaboration ensuring we exceed their expectations each day. Great work Kylie!\n\n21#Sharing that golden info!|Big thanks go out to this group from Customer Success (+ one former star)... for joining calls and sharing use-cases from their current clients. The context we gather beyond what is listed in config app or appearing on reports is golden information and will be a powerful asset to the wider team as we look for opportunities to increase investment. Thank you for your time and efforts!\n\n22#Holiday support|Hi all, just want to say thanks so much for your support on multiple client requests while I was ooo.  I'm thinking of Avanade here, as they seemed to have kept you all busy at some stage over the two weeks. I really appreciate you all jumping in along the way to support while I took time off to spend with my mum, especially in knowing how much is going on for everybody right now. Thank you all so much for living our teamwork value.\n\n23#Massive \"CLEAN\" Energy for Energize and focus@bp|A  SENSATIONAL start for bp's Energize and focus@bp (Conversations) roll out today!!  IT has been a long time coming!!  Just around 4 years to approximate.  There were many individuals involved in this journey! All were so helpful and engaged so thank you!  The very core team- it was blood, sweat and some tears.  Kylie, to you for being there every step of the way in all kinds of ways!  Jose, same, all the follow up and help with issues.  Kel, beginning the pilot so well and thoughtfully that we won the Conversations piece.  Steve, my partner in crime always, for working through the creativity on the renewal to drive the additions. Ro, for all of your expertise and assistance that helped them move!  Mary Elizabeth, the follow up's through everything including Covid!  Diarmund, what can I say, thank you forever.  Lynette and Shawn, the best for last!  Truly, for everything!  The communications, the design, the best practices,the communications, the poring over language documents, the multitude of calls done and to come.  The only word is MAGNIFICENT!!  Kellye, for all the comms to come!  bp is up and running on Conversations, globally, as of this morning (UK time!)  37K+ employees on the platform, more employees added on Energize, awards given to their CEO for courage.  It takes a village and this village was phonomenal\n\n24#Breakout Leaders!!|A huge thank you to this group who helped share their knowledge and expertise when it comes to preparing and delivering account reviews for our customers. As our team grows, we rely on you and your leadership to share your experiences and learnings. Even with all on your plate, you each took time to prepare and lead discussions during our Account Review workshop and I am so grateful for your partnership!! Thank you!!\n\n25#My People|First, congratulations to each of you on the launch of focus@bp!!!!! We did it! Second, thank YOU for being my people. This would not have happened without each of you and your support. Kylie and Jose, your relationship with the bp team, and your pulse on their ethos was invaluable to the launch. You helped make sure we stayed on track and consistently had the bigger picture of their strategy in your back pocket. Gavin, thank you for letting me come to you with anything and everything and keeping me honest! We had a lot of learnings together on this one that we will definitely bring into the next. I truly appreciate all of your help and the gut checks. Lynette, you are the creator of this program, inside and out. Your breadth of knowledge of Conversations, and how to communicate it to users is amazing. I would be absolutely lost without you and your guidance. And last but certainly not least, Ro, thank you for sticking with us and getting us here. I love that you continue to join calls and have a presence on the launch and ensuring the bp team has the best experience. I hope you each take a moment to step back and appreciate the scope of the achievement of this launch - focus@bp was announced to over 36,000 users today. Thank you and congratulations!\n\n26#Championing MTM|Thank you for sharing your experiences with Moments That Matter at the recent Customer Success All Hands call. Sharing real world examples of moments helped to illustrate not only different ways to create moments of Elevation, Pride, Insight, and Connection but also the impact those differentiated moments have on driving lifetime advocacy which in turn drives our business goals.  Kylie, you shared a moment of Elevation created for bp to celebrate reaching 1 million moments with a congratulations video from the Workhuman team. It was a moment to celebrate partnership and elevate the achievement of a significant program milestone.   Melissa, you shared a moment of Pride created for Pepsico when they won Bronze at the Brandon Hall Excellence in Technology Awards. The moment was celebrated and elevated with a meaningful award email and yummy goodies. Also, as an all around champion for MTM, you offered support to your teammates in creating MTM for their customers.    Kat, the moment of Connection you created for nVent's launch is a great example of how sharing something personal can deepen a relationship and create a differentiated experience. The program team loved the custom cocktail recipes so much they created an experience for their internal team to celebrate with them.  Taking the time to create special human moments that matter like this are powerful and leave our customers feeling valued, invested, human, delighted, and supported. Thank you for your commitment to creating a differentiated experience and your openness to sharing these examples with your teammates.\n\n27#Thank you|Hi Kylie, I just wanted to say thank you for the help you have given me since I joined Workhuman. Your advice and tips on how to deal with customer queries plus insights on internal systems and navigating these have been invaluable in helping me to get started.\n\n28#focus@bp is ready for UAT|THANK YOU ALL so much for getting us to this point! focus@bp is ready for UAT and it is so much in part to you and your efforts over the past week. There have been many technical challenges including languages not updating, translations being entered, SSO, lightbox updates, branding updates, etc. Thank you all for your support and keeping me apprised of the various workstreams that have been involved. I am excited to move into this next phase of launch with you all, and with the bp team!\n\n29#Holiday Cover|Jose, Steve and Kylie - Thank you so much for covering me while I was enjoying my time off with my family. When I got back to work I was surprised by the number of emails I received, but at the same time I was so relieved to see that the majority of the issues had been dealt with by you. Being able to unplug from time to time is massively important, but that wouldn't be possible without a team like you to support that. A huge thank you to each of you!\n\n30#Great teamwork|Thank you Kylie for taking action on a customer query when a member of the team was out of office. You took all the steps necessary and got a reply which the customer appreciates.  Great teamwork and your support is really appreciated.\n\n31#Bulking up for bp|I wanted to reach out to all of you and say thank you for all the work that has been done at bp this year.  It truly \"takes a village\" especially at a client with so much rolling out in 2022.  Jose, you were so instrumental this year in getting the Bernard anniversary award out the correct way.  Without you we would have had a very difficult time recovering from that and you made it seamless.  Lynette, you have done a tremendous job on all things Conversations!  Your tenacity, follow through and knowledge has been a game changer there.  Couldn't do it without you.  Kylie, I'm so glad we had the opportunity to meet with bp before the world went cracy again.  It was great to connect with all of the team players.  Thanks for all the work you do day in and day out to help things go smoothly!  It's much appreciated.  We have our work cut out for us in 2022 and I'm sure this fabulous team will help to make it all extremely successful  Have a great holiday season and thank you!\n\n32#Support from day one!|I'm just finished my first month at Workhuman and want to thank all of you for being so welcoming and for the support you have provided me. Thanks for helping with all the configurations changes with Deloitte, always being available for any questions I might have and even jumping on a call last minute to help set customer expectations. I'm grateful to be apart of such an amazing team and looking forward to working together next year!\n\n33#Rebill Resolution!|Thank you all so much for your help and input along the way with rebilling open AZ China invoices to the UK. This will clear a massive backlog of 123 items on their 6 Chinese accounts. It took many calls and would not have happened without each of you. Thanks again and Enjoy!\n\n34#Thank you for sharing your time!|Kylie - I SO enjoyed talking with you today! I appreciate the perspective of jumping in with patience and comfort with the unknown. It was also great to hear about your IN-PERSON (a novelty these days!) client meeting - hope we can all have more of those in the coming months. Thank YOU!\n\n35#Willingness to support|Kylie, thank you for the support when I was unexpectedly out of the office a few weeks ago. You were happy to jump on interviews & do anything you could to help me disconnect. I really appreciated your support & caring nature. Apologies I missed the timeliness of this recognition but just wanted to let you know I was super grateful!\n\n36#Grateful for You|Thank you to each of you for being a great person to work with. I thoroughly enjoy our conversations and continuously learn something new, from random phrases, how we can improve something or even a reminder on how we should or can do something. Each challenge is embraced and I truly admire how you do this for example taking on a new customer, launching a new population or responding to challenging questions. There's never a quiet moment and I love this, always a discussion to be had or something to be shared. I appreciate your positivity but also the reality checks which are sometimes needed. I am grateful for each of you and the great work you do for our customers. To Kenny, Peter & Matt - Happy Thanksgiving.  And to the rest of us enjoy the recharge day on Friday 😊\n\n37#Math!|Thank you both for your quick help to think through my math brain tease yesterday.  Its knowing I can count on good friends and colleagues like you both that help me get through the day.  Thank you for taking a few minutes out of your days to assist!\n\n38#Strategic Meetings!! Real Convo. Real Results!|This team!!! Bravo!! What an inspiring, engaging, action-oriented, strategy trumps all session! Corbrina, you've just written a Linkedin Learning \"masterclass\" on how to host meetings with executives that are strategic, relevant, personal, and valuable! Truly, putting forth a compelling strategic agenda, working tirelessly in the background to understand what matters most to the stakeholders, and orchestrating a session that ties the customer's strategic priorities directly back to our solution and what's next. No better evidence than David White, VP, People Analytics, Comp, & HR M&A saying \"I couldn't wait for today's meeting. I know how valuable it will be.\" Your leadership in understanding what's most important to Linkedin, seeking out their FY22 Strategic Priorities, sharing how WH best supports, being open to new ways of knitting the story together and supporting us all is remarkable! In true, Corbrina just nixed \"account reviews\" and took executive meetings to a whole new level, Strategic Sessions!   Meisha-ann and Erica, there are no better data experts and storytellers in the world! The Linkedin team hung on your every word as you talked about how more than ever, we need to stay connected and build community .. how connection and gratitude reinforces the foundation for a resilient, engaged and hybird workforce. Plus, all of the Bravo! data that points to recognition is having a huge impact on retention, engagement and performance. David said \"we need to double down on retention metrics.\" It's critical. Kylie, your relationship with the Linkedin team is tremendous, your knowledge about the program, how and why to grow it, and day to day incredible actions shine through! Every 4 minutes a Bravo connection is happening! Incredible!! Melissa F, Morgan and Erika, your support and extra set of ears on the call is super helpful as we continue to learn, grow and leave \"account reviews\" in the dust! You Rock!!\n\n39#Survived another review, all thanks to you!|Kylie, you're a fantastic colleague and teammate and I have to thank you for all the help in refining the data for LinkedIn's account reviews, and especially this latest one. The insights you glean from your meetings with Carol are so incredibly helpful and informative as I think about what data to show (or NOT to show) and how to speak to it. All the time and energy you pour into LinkedIn is so apparent - you set us up for success and all of your work behind the scenes does not go unnoticed. Thank you thank you!!!!\n\n40#Preparation Is The Key To Success|Erica, Meisha-Ann, Traci, Melissa, and Kylie, thank you so much for all of the hours you’ve each put in over the last several weeks preparing for our upcoming Strategic Review with Linkedin’s entire HR leadership team. Your commitment and dedication to ensuring we deliver a refined, tailored, and compelling presentation has been inspiring.\n\n41#Caring for bp|Kylie, thank you for leading the charge in the celebration of bp\"s Millionth moment.  The video that you managed for this event turned out lovely and, as Nataly said, it \"made her day\"!  Such a great and thoughtful idea to make this a very special happening at bp.  Love that bp feels the love :)  Great job!\n\n42#Check MATE, Workday!|Congratulations to the badass team for winning a face off vs. Workday for Conversations at bp! This has been a longtime coming and I know that your have been working, strategizing, playing a game of master level chess to come to this place. SO proud for all of you and so happy to have another strategic customer leveraging the entire WH Cloud. Cheer to each of you and all of you as a team. Incredible work! Brava!!!\n\n43#Respect For Customers|Kylie - I want to take an opportunity and thank you for partnering with me to help support and lead Linkedin. The growth we've accomplished YTD has been significant. The momentum has been nonstop from a brand and program refresh, exponential growth in their usage of team awards, and the launch of a trendsetting ERG Recognition Program. Kylie, you live the Respect for Customer value in every aspect. Your patience, guidance, attention to detail, and leadership on this account are pivotal to its ongoing success and growth.  I can't express enough how incredibly grateful I am for your support and partnership.\n\n44#Customer Success - Dublin Edition|Jose, Steve, Tracey, Kylie and Guil. I want to recognise you all for your continued and incredible commitment to our customers internal and external. Even though its nowhere near the same working with you all remotely, sharing a chat over coffee or cake in the Dublin office. Hopefully that changes soon and we can all have a joint team meeting in Jamaica 😉 It is always a pleasure working with each of you all on various issues. Every time I work with you all I am reminded of our companys core principles of bringing humantiy to the workplace while we work through some items. Whether that is through the stressful or calm moments. You are all fantastic and I am grateful for everything you do day in day out!!\n\n45#It Takes A Village at bp|Team, when we win this Conversations pilot we need to have a HUGE celebration.  Thanks so very much to all of you for your hard work and tenacity as we work toward making this experience the very best for bp.  Not to mention all the technology hoops around the CEO' s 30 year anniversary.  Feedback to date has been that the decision makers at bp are so impressed with not only our solution but our team.  There is no other like the individuals here.  The long days, weekends and almost insurmountable hurdles of this project have been non-stop.  Thanks to all of you and here's to keeping the momentum!\n\n46#Perseverance & Patience!|Kylie, thank you for taking the time over recent days to step through some pretty complex Config updates with me. Under time pressure you've remained calm and steady and have been more than willing to share your knowledge with me, I've learned so much from our conversations that I can put to good use going forward!\n\n47#Reimagining for bp|Thank you all for answering the call for help to figure out how to create a moment that matters to celebrate bp's CEO, as he marks 30 years at the company. The customer ask was for functionality not supported in our product today, but you each sought to set aside your priorities and explore options, see around corners, troubleshoot issues and deliver a solution. We are in a sales process with bp, so the efforts you've gone to are even more helpful to our cause. Thanks Jose and Kylie for your collaboration, direction and understanding which enabled us to get there.\n\n48#Annual Leave Cover|Thank you so much Jose, Kyle & Tracey for covering me for a full week while I was out enjoying my annual leave! I was very pleased to see that the majority of the tasks I received had already been sorted out (some of them were actually pretty complex). I know there was a lot of back and forth on some of those situations on top of your daily activities, so I really appreciate your dedication and sense of urgency managing my clients. I absolutely love this team and I am very grateful for being part of it!\n\n49#Catalyze continuously evolving|Kylie thank you for all that you do for AstraZeneca, each week/month there is something being tweaked and worked on.  Most recently you added new text on the approver screen, changes to the Award advisor, a change to include gender in the data file and working on a video team award from the EVP of Oncology, we appreciate the strong partnership you have with this customer and how you work together to ensure the program continues to grow & evolve.\n\n50#Knowledge Sharing|Thank you for presenting at this weeks Customer Success All Hands meeting! Kylie, Sophia and Rachel - the stories you shared about how you are each working with your customers on DEI initiatives brought helpful insight that allows the broader team to think about DEI opportunities at other customers. Nick, Matt and Judith - Congrats to each of you on your recent launches and thank you for sharing your learnings with the broader team!\n\n51#Focused with bp|To the fantastic team behind the launch of the bp Conversations pilot, Thank You!!! Each of you played an integral role in ensuring bp’s vision was captured in the Conversations platform, from the branding to verbiage and program capabilities. Not only did we bring our best to each design session, but our program customizations allowed for bp to see just how creative Workhuman can be. Kylie, thanks for fostering a great relationship with the bp team. All this helped set the stage for the launch and kept them open to our ideas and workarounds.I appreciate your support in getting them over the finish line last week. Lynette, it goes without saying you are a STAR in consulting, mentorship, and strategy. You answered every question regarding know-hows or best practices. In addition, you helped the team personalize the Dynamic Guidance to differentiate us from our competition. Ro, you lead the charge on the Sales side and have kept the bp team thinking about potentially rolling this out to their entire population. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed. Amy, thank you for being my mentor during this launch. Because of your advice, I was able to rethink my launch approach, gain the customers' trust in our recommendations, and keep them on track for launch day.  Jose, I sincerely appreciate you stepping in support of Kylie and me during the final stages of the launch. Specifically during the many technical changes. You ensure all teams within Workhuman were in sync to the point bp felt their launch was ready for go-live. Talk about a phenomenal team of humans creating change for bp!\n\n52#BP Conversations Pilot is Live - Thank You!|A huge shout out to each of you involved in the bp Conversations pilot going live on Tuesday 6 July. Sometimes it certainly takes a village to go live and this one of those situations so thank you for the important role you played.  To Gavin, Yury, Andrew & Katia, the conversations team who understood the urgency and reacted so quickly to support on all of the necessary changes to ensure production mirrored their test environment & delivered their requirements. To Stephen, Gerard, Paul, Kate & Robert who also acted with urgency to address any of the requests made to them. To Kel & Kylie who liaised with the customer, had regular calls during launch and for go live & held their hand to deliver and ensure we had a successful rollout. Kel loved the relationship you formed with the group during this launch.  Kylie you've established a great relationship with bp and that trust is testament to the rollout this week.  To Nick who joined the team in Kel's absence and kept keys parts moving, logging tickets, working with the customer and again delivering for them. Lynette & Ro thank you for being the subject matter experts, for guiding our friends at bp explaining the thought process behind the \"why\" Conversations work this way & what it delivers for them.  Thank you Lynette for launching to the pilot group yesterday and conducting an informative training session with your usual charm & insights.  I am proud to work with each of you and thank you for all your incredible work on this project!\n\n53#Taking time for Discovery!|All! Thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy days to participate in discovery calls for the customer database growth and governance project. Everyone offered terrific perspective and helped the team get a well rounded view of the current process and areas or opportunity. Excited to share the findings more broadly and appreciate you all!\n\n54#Taking time for a strategy session|Thank you all for your time, focus, thoughtful ideas and teamwork talking through a number of different customer situations.  You all contributed solutions and recommendations as we worked through specific customer scenarios.  The time was well spent sharing varied approaches in helping to manage through each situation and I really appreciate taking the day out of your busy days for this exercise.  The level of expertise you each bring to the table through your past experiences was clearly evident.  As it was said during the meeting, you are all in the positions you're in based on the level of customer experience you've built up over the years.  I'm thankful once again to work with such a great group of thoughtful, customer focused professionals.\n\n55#CatAlyZe Conductor|Kylie,  It's been a month. When a client the size of AstraZeneca is celebrating the first anniversary of their program, CatAlyZe, it takes a lot of coordination. I initially called you an annual review meeting maestro, but now I've settled on calling you a conductor.   When you look up the definition of a conductor in an orchestra, their role is to unify a large group of musicians into a core sound instead of a wild bunch of different sounds surging out. And that's what you did, wrangling a large group of us in support of a jam-packed agenda for AZ's annual review meeting. You pinned down the areas of focus, you hunted down the data, you kept us running on track and you kept us meeting on a regular cadence to help prep for the annual review. You were able to anticipate and satisfy Claire's burning data questions, and even had her ending the meeting by stating that \"we'll celebrate this next week.\" And the work didn't stop there, AZ was inspired to organize an anniversary meeting with all members of the AZ and Workhuman teams that were involved with launch. This had you presenting some of the key stats and highlights of the program, and ended delightfully with all team members sharing memories and learned experiences. I know I was touched to hear them sharing that it as a career highlight to be involved, and the one project that taught them most about how their business works and who the key contacts are across the organization.   On top of these back-to-back strategic meetings, you're handling their numerous (and I do mean numerous) day-to-day demands, as well as looking strategically to the future for follow-ups and new things to pursue. And yet you still have the brainpower to remember the magical things key to relationship building, it's always a pleasure to partner with you on moments that matter.   You have an ear for what the client needs to hear, you set the tempo of the team, and you ensure that Workhuman is playing a consistent tune. I bow to you!\n\n56#Partnership At Linkedin|Erica, Meisha-Ann, Traci, Kylie, and Melissa - I want to take an opportunity and thank each of you for partnering with me to help support and lead Linkedin through a rollercoaster year. The highs and lows experienced by Linkedin from the beginning of the pandemic to now have been significant. 2020 started off bleak with a shake-up of the HR leadership team, substantial layoffs, a measurable drop in employee morale, and the threat of a 50% reduction to their recognition investment. I'm inspired by how each of you leaned into these difficult moments to help show Linkedin how \"human connection matters now more than ever.\" Meisha Ann & Erica thank you for helping Linkedin understand what their data revealed about the pandemic, their priorities, and providing actionable guidance on how to accelerate their performance. Your knowledge, expertise, and thoughtfulness are bar none. Traci and Melissa the comms strategy and presentations you create are no less than a work of art. You've helped Linkedin understand the impact of Bravo's role in shaping their culture and cultivating a connected workforce. Kylie, you live the Respect for Customer value in every aspect. Your patience, guidance, attention to detail, and leadership on this account are pivotal to its ongoing success and growth. Because of the passion and purpose, you all brought over the last 15 months we were able to help Linkedin mitigate signs of cultural decay, keep employees feeling supported, retain their full recognition budget, and deepen our relationships with their new executive leadership team.  I can't express enough how incredibly grateful I am for your support and partnership.\n\n57#Building Blocks at bp|Kylie, we are so lucky to have you as the CSM on bp.  Your day to day work with the PM, Kerryn, has been pivotal in making everything work (literally :)).  Our strategy session with the new players this week was amazing and everyone's participation and dedication to making it great was wonderful.  We were like a well oiled machine presenting and chiming in to build on the things we are wanting to get done there.  Your time, effort, skills and partnering were off the charts!  Truly appreciate all of your mastery.  More great things to come!\n\n58#A moment that matters for AZ|Kylie & Joyce thank you for creating a memorable moment that matters for AstraZeneca on the 1st anniversary of their CatAlyZe program.  Kylie thank you for the thought & work you put into this moment, you considered what the team could receive knowing that they are restricted from most items, you researched the options and in line with their environmental approach made a donation to the charity “One Tree Planted” to plant 500 trees in their names to celebrate this occasion. Joyce thank you for crafting a wonderful message encompassing so much from their first year, the passion of the team, impressive utilization stats and award message words that speak to their successful program, beautifully done. Thank you both for the teamwork in pulling this together and Kylie thank you for sending the award on May 4th on their anniversary date, a lovely acknowledgment to a great team & partnership!\n\n59#Support everyday|Kylie thank you for raising a BP query yesterday, a public holiday & letting me know about the issue. Your commitment to our customers is appreciated!\n\n60#Knowledge sharing|Kylie & Allie, thank you for sharing an overview on retirement awards & how they work for your customers. It was helpful to have an understanding of customer examples & what we do for BP & Health First.

Marie & Kylie you have brought the bp perspective and shared every nuance and advised how we can best partner with them & Kylie thank you for managing the meetings & keeping us on track. Ro the amount of pre work you do is phenomenal, you are an expert in this area, and question & guide the conversation in a genuine and kind way.  Lynette, your Conversations experience and knowledge of bp & can do attitude is inspiring, simply a master at work.  And finally Kel, you jump right in, ask all the right questions, call out when decisions are required and are a great partner in this.  Individually you are wonderful but to see your collaboration and thoughtful approach, leading and directing to ensure we are ready for design lab and the next steps of this project is awesome!  Well done!\n\n62#Branding bp brilliantly|Kylie, thank you for all of your work and effort with bp.  You covered every, single aspect of this rebrand brilliantly. Gathering all the right resources, staying on top of what bp needed to deliver and making sure it all happened exactly when they wanted it to.  Your relationship with the PM there is spectacular and all of your efforts there have allowed that to come about.  I am so happy to have you as my partner on this account.  You have done an amazing job and it's appreciated all around.  Thanks so very much for all you do!\n\n63#Thanks for sharing your knowledge|Kylie thank you for sharing some of the highlights from the recent LinkedIn review duirng our monthly meeting. It was helpful to understand how you spoke to them, areas of focus, positioning of growth opportunities & their reactions. DEI is a key topic now, thank you for also including some talking points & slides & sharing your experience. Great job!\n\n64#Thanks for the assist!|Steve, Kylie and Tracey, thank you so much for your amazing assistance in helping onboard our new hire, Kevin, in Dublin! Kevin is our first new hire on the Customer Success team in Dublin for quite some time and I did not want all of his trainings to be crammed into the few hours of the day when we were be working over here in Framingham. You all quickly raised your hand to help out and go even beyond the planned training sessions. I so appreciated all of your help as I get up to speed with my new role. Your insight and experience is so valued. Thanks again!!\n\n65#Appreciating You!|Customer Success Teams thank you for the amazing work that you do for our customers everyday! We wanted to take a moment on Employee Appreciation Day to appreciate all of you for your truly impactful work.

As we strive to bring recognition to the global workplace you are all making an impact through your efforts, activities and thoughtful interactions. From, Jay, Jose, Danielle, Michelle and Amy\n\n66##OneTeam  #OneBravo!  #OnePartnership!|Bravo!! Bravo!! OMG, I'm still smiling from our Linkedin partnership meeting and hope you are, too! All I can say is ... the best things in life are worth waiting for, believing in, working together on and just never letting go of (virtual squad hug here). Right!! In Linkedin's words building a rocket ship needs \"fuel\" not \"drag\". You all contributed to showing Linkedin how Bravo! is the \"high octane\" fuel to drive connection, people, culture and purpose - no drag here!!  Corbrina, your leadership with the meeting strategy, goals and outcomes was clearly articulated from the start to the rest of this team - setting us all up for success! Plus, you introduced David White, VP,  - the new exec sponsor to our partnership, the5-year journey, key insights, shared personal stories to illustrate points and drive connection! The #OneLinkedin theme resonated throughout.   Kylie and Jose, your dedication to Linkedin's success, the partnership, the patience (yes, patience with Carol) and attention to detail so everything knitted together perfectly was amazing! Kylie, you live our value of \"imagination\" everyday and inspire Carol and Linkedin to create moments that matter and leverage Bravo! in big and small ways to achieve results!   Erica, Meisha-ann and Isha, first, Linkedin LOVED your team's name WHIQ and even said 'We should be Linkedin IQ.\" And IQ intel you gave them around how Bravo! can play a massive role in the org becoming #OneLinkedin, ways to innovate and uncover key talent insights, - what's the recognition data telling us, where are the opportunities, where does it intersect with other initiatives DEI, and how can we do more of it, together! #OneIQTeam.  Melissa, our visual magic maker who takes concepts, words, charts and turns them into captivating stories, key points and messages that land so well with customers! I can't thank you enough for all your support and making us better, together! Bravo!! ROCK STARS!!\n\n67#Agile for AZ|Kylie I would like to call out the time, effort & dedication that you have given to AZ in the last number of weeks. There were/are a number of uploads for various reasons and you helped the team navigate through the options available to them and solutions based on their goals. When there was a set back, you reacted quickly, providing options & a resolution within that same day. You're building a strong relationship with the team which is critical to their growth & partnership. Thank you for all that you are doing, it's really appreciated!\n\n68#bp!!!|I wanted to thank you both for your never ending drive and enthusiasm at bp.  Its so great to work with both of you and I'm forever grateful.  All the work you do with Kerryn to accomplish projects at bp is amazing.  Kylie, your dedication to bp is endless.  I think you and Kerryn have each other on speed dial.  Your follow up and interactions with bp has helped to move things forward and, on occasion, smooth things over.  Now we are refreshing their platform and preparing for a strong 2021.  Lynette, can't beat the fact that you have been on bp since day one.  They have such trust and confidence in everything you do for them.  Such a wonderful relationship to have.  Plus, your enthusiasm, every day , is incredible.  Here is to many more victories at bp!\n\n69#Making Continental see the bigger picture!|Well done Tracey for leading the charge for a tough customer call -  Continental !!! Its one thing to take over an account from someone else a few weeks ago but then to lead an important call in a short space of time and try and change the mindset of a VP is no short feat but you gave it 1000% and the preparation you did for the meeting was in clear evidence on the day and whilst we did not get the desired results we would have wanted, it did make them see the bigger picture, asking them those challenging questions of what kind of program do you want for your employees. Despite their VP being stubborn and not wanting to change current program design, kudos though for the WHIQ data that you presented as that was well received!!! I get the feeling that once the penny drops what you were saying will make them come back for more intel on this…. Kylie, well done for plugging away on this account too over the last year. You did a great job planting the seeds and getting the Workhuman Team to finally meet their senior team and I am grateful for your hard work that helped Tracey for her important meeting and finally Dave thanks for being there in the background and being great support for Tracey and Kylie who I know truly appreciated your guidance and past experience post the meeting on how we plan our next steps with them. Well done to you all!\n\n70#Inspired|Kylie and Joyce, thank you both for all your work on the planning for re-opening Continental's Inspire program for points recognition. Kylie you siezed the day with the program team before Xmas. You asked for an opportunity to meet with the Exec sponsor in order to discuss Workhuman best practices for rolling out their monetary awards program again. What a result, when we received the invite from the program team to meet with him. Thank you both for your time, energy and contributions to the conversation on how their program can benefit through best practice design and communication. We went to the meeting with our best foot forward and while we didnt get the result were hoping for, the seeds have certainly been planted for future conversations. Thank you both for living our innovation and determination value for this client.\n\n71#Moment that Matters for AZ|Lynette and Kylie, thank you for your partnership in creating a moment that matters for AstraZeneca in the launch of their COVID-19 vaccine with the University of Oxford. From the inspiration to the final product, we had a heartfelt message to let Program Sponsor Claire and PM Laura how much Workhuman appreciated the efforts of their employees and the hope it gave us as a human beings. This clearly touched them, as they both responded with messages with thanks. Claire even remarked, \"This is awesome – thank you so much on behalf of AZ.  We are very proud of what we have achieved and through CatAlyZe have been able to share our gratitude with our people.  Thank you for all your support through 2020.\" Not only did it recognize Claire and Laura, it helped us reinforce the efforts of CatAlyZe in recognizing these EXTRAORDINARY efforts of their employees.  Thank you!\n\n72#Team Award Communication Flows & Up-Dates!|All, Just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for keeping operations up to speed on the Team Awards initiative during 2020. It has been an exceptional year on many fronts, and the team awards have contributed greatly to the continued success we are experiencing during Q4. Many, Many Company records have been broken in the recent weeks.. from Highest Value of Non Cash Awards in a week, Highest number of orders in a week, Highest number of shipments in a week, Highest number of customer contacts in a week...the list goes on! YOUR notification of the various client team awards and continued communication (or answering my questions! :) ) on when the award was going to happen, what countries were in scope, what value was the award, was SOLI a factor, who was the message from within the client company, do they have amazon,  what would the message say, how many HUMANS would be receiving a well deserved moment of recognition etc... It really does take a village! Your support and willingness to provide as much detail as possible on the team awards, was exceptionally useful during recent week's. The communication flow enabled us to plan resources and inventory levels accordingly, helped us to get the right information to the right teams at the right time, enabling us to continue to deliver an exceptional employee experience globally...while records continued to been broken on a daily basis! Thanks again for your support, Roll on 2021! Enjoy!\n\n73#Be Proud of YOUR Success|As we wrap up 2020, I wanted to take a few minutes to call out how much I value our strong bond as a team. I am proud to say we have accomplished so much as a team; in fact I think we did so much more than we could have ever imagined! Guil, you became our newest member in Customer Success over this side of the pond, your determination to learn what we do and how we engage with our customers at Customer Success has shone throughout the year from attending some your Partnership Reviews with the likes of Air Products & Otsuka to your end of year work on Team Awards. Imagine what you can do in 2021! Tracey, you grow from strength to strength as each year passes. You have made some truly memorable moments this year from AIB having their strongest year to date which will see them net $3.4 million before year end, that is a massive success for a client that was aiming to do just $1 million this year with Appreciate! to seeing you flex your strategic muscles to the full with customers like Mallinckrodt. Kylie, you really have made your mark in 2020, managing 3 of our most ambitious clients – with AstraZeneca planting the seeds for bigger success, helping Corbrina develop new connections with LinkedIn, who just happened to have their biggest success to date with us ($9 million in 2019 vs $21 million in 2020 YTD!!!), to supporting BP as they navigate through their toughest year. The one constant thing here is YOU, I admire you greatly and the fact you are not afraid to speak up and challenge all of us if there is something we can do better. Finally, I want to thank you all for allowing me to lead for you, you put a lot of faith in me this year and I do appreciate you allowing me to help you when I could and allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. Thank you!! Please make sure to take time off to recharge and start 2021 with a bang because if its anything like 2020 you are going to need your rest!! 😊 Enjoy and happy holidays!\n\n74#Keeping a foot on that Data pedal|What an incredible opportunity awaits at Astrazeneca - there are fewer more prominent and influential brands globally right now and it is a privilege to see the amazing work achieved with them since launch. Kylie, you have been at the core of this success and your tenacity to support and drive their upward trajectory is superb. As a Data hungry client, we recently had to pivot and deliver program insights after 6 months - this was a hugely insightful and thought provoking session for them and sets the tone for deeper data alignment into 2021. Thanks to Alan and Jesse for their partnership on this.\n\n75#Especially thankful and grateful!|Team, at this time of the year I want to take a moment and say THANK YOU to each and every one of you for being the incredible people you are and bringing your best to our customers every single day.  This year has been like no other for so many reasons with many twists, turns and surprises along the way but you all continue to deliver excellence in all that you do.  Thank you for being flexible, collaborative, supportive, customer focused and selfless in countless ways.  You all continue to internalize and action the priorities we have laid out in front of you without missing a beat.  Some of the many examples are  driving team awards, pushing Life Events and Conversations, helping customers expand their programs while doubling down on recognition, leading hundreds of hours of customer meetings, supporting your new teammates as they are getting up to speed, working together with other teams and departments and dropping what you're doing just to help someone out.  The success we are seeing with our customers and as a business are a result of your efforts, so thank you from the bottom of my heart.  On a personal level I am thankful to work with such an amazing team.  Thank you for the laughs, tears (only when laughing!) and finding the joy in the midst of the everyday things we're accomplishing together.  I hope you all enjoy the next few days of well deserved rest.  I am grateful for you all!\n\n76#AZ Problem Solving|Kylie, Thanks so much for your time on today's call, also the several back and forths on emails regarding various AZ billing questions. You're always so proactive and approachable, and I appreciate your can do attitude. So thank you again, and enjoy :)\n\n77#You are VALUED!|Rachel and Kylie, I want to acknowledge the work you did to get this latest project over the line for Edwards, we had 2 weeks to move Korean employees over to a new Years of Service set-up and get a new population of 600 employees added to the VALUED program. Rachel, thank you so much for your diligent work to complete the set-up from start to finish and for your collaboration, you kept me updated on every piece of the project from your end and worked with Kylie while I was ooo., Kylie I really appreciate you keeping this moving from the client end and working to get the final pieces from them so we could go live last Friday. It's not easy to pick up in the middle of project but I knew the client was in safe hands. I really appreciate both of you. Thank you for being great colleagues and living our Respect for Customers value.\n\n78#Spend Management Expert|Kylie - Thank you so much for showing an alternative method on how Spend Managers can upload funding to spend accounts! Hadn't you taken the time to have a call with me and show best practices, my client would have been really frustrated. I appreciate your knowledge and teamwork!\n\n79#We need WiQ t-Shirts!|Congratulations and a hearty Shout out to this team for an amazing engagement with Astrazeneca today. Positioning and leading with our Data Science capability and sharing acute post launch insights had them on the edge of their seats!  We have learned so much about them just from this call. Thank you for making this happen.There are several exciting opportunities to support their wider strategies from accelerating participation, supporting their D&I efforts with Data partnership on gender and ethnicity, connecting with their D&I council and assisting with their skills assessment. Looking forward to building on this and taking this client to the top of our list. Great job.\n\n80#Bravos All Around|Kylie, Alison, Kevin, and Rebecca, outstanding work! When we got word from Linkedin that their new CEO & new CHRO approved a $500 award for all employees to go live in a week, each of you mobilized immediately. Kylie, you worked tirelessly to support Linkedin’s PM, managing all of the internal teams and logistics to ensure a super quick turnaround on all of LI’s requests. There were several changes sent through overnight by Ryan & Teuila. You worked seamlessly under pressure and did a fantastic job getting all of the teams on board to get us over the line. The PM even reached out to express her gratitude and appreciation for all of the hard work you were doing. Alison, Kevin, and Rebecca, in under a week, you quickly pulled together a Linkedin only curated collection that aligned perfectly with their award and helped inspire redemption on merchandise. This type of broad-based thinking and collaboration embodies the spirit of respect for teamwork and customers. I can’t say thank you enough for the alignment, partnership, and speedy turnaround.\n\n81#LinkedIn's response to World Gratitude day:)|Kylie, this MUST be the BIG story of the week at Workhuman!!! You could not make this up.... Here we have a top Workhuman customer who has been running their successful recognition Bravo program for the last few years and then 2020 the year of change for all us, in a matter of a few months we have witnessed this customer cut their global headcount by 700+employees and run the risk of reducing their investment with Workhuman by 50%....With the news of reducing headcount being tough for any employer, it was fantastic news to hear this week that change was about to happen and what better way to say this to their employees but from their new CEO, Ryan Roslansky who felt that it was vital to ensure that the culture and amazing human talent working at LinkedIn was acknowledged with the news that every employee would get a $500 award to support their well-being!! What does this mean?? Well it means that we will see over $8.1 million recognition moments created in just 24hrs!!!! So effectively we will be witnessing 12 month’s investment being done in just one day!! The ‘icing on the cake’ was your suggestion to Carol to issue Ryan’s award out to their employees on ‘World Gratitude Day’ – Monday 21st September which will make this day a very memorable one for all LinkedIn employees! Well done Kylie in all the work you keep doing for this exciting customer every day and helping them choose Workhuman to celebrate with all their employees on ‘World Gratitude Day’!!\n\n82#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt in the first week of go-live to make sure we have all your important information correct!\n\n83#Virtual team offsite success|Team, thank you all for a highly productive, collaborative and solution focused virtual offsite.  It was such an energizing time together working through some of the opportunities and challenges you're all facing in supporting some of our largest customers.  You all brought so many insights, personal experiences, ideas and solutions to the table that helped in our conversations as we think about ways to continue to delight our customers while working through the every day challenges supporting our clients.  Thank you for being open and candid throughout the meeting as well as respectful to each other in navigating the different conversations in our remote world.  I know carving out time away from your \"normal\" day is a big ask and appreciate you all staying completely engaged as a team.  We have some great ideas and opportunities in front of us as a result of the collaboration you all showed today.  I am so thankful and humble to be part of such an incredible team, who is doing great work every single day.  I appreciate each of you, your customer focus and desire to bring the power of recognition to our client's organizations.  Thank you!\n\n84#Moment of Gratitude from Sales Bootcamp 2020|A few weeks back, the sales team wrapped up an excellent bootcamp. As part of this experience we had the pleasure of hearing perspective from three very happy Workhuman customers: Claire Wheldon from AstraZeneca, Lark Kalstad from Lam Research / Symmetricom and Peter Church from Avangrid. Each shared important perspective that will help us become a more effective sales organization.   Without a doubt, these conversations would not have been possible but for the many unsung heroes who helped to create, launch and maintain the successful programs from which each of these perspectives were grounded.  While it may have taken a while to track down all who may have been involved, with Meghan Honan’s help, I’m happy to finally be able share this moment of appreciation. Thank you all for helping to make such happy customers AND, by extension, such a memorable conversation and learning experience!:)  AstraZeneca  Ongoing CSM – Kylie McMillian Launch LSM – Rich Sorrentino S&C – Lynette Silva        Lam Research   Ongoing CSM – Claire DiDonato Prior CSM (at Symmetricom) - Marcy Ricci Launch LSM – Rich Sorrentino S&C – Lauren Spenser   Avangrid   Ongoing CSM – Tiffany Steinke  Launch LSM – Matt Gillen S&C – Joyce Silvia\n\n85#The Ultimate Multitasker💻☎📈📝✏|Thanks so much Kylie for allowing me to really unplug from the business world for the last couple of weeks and allow me to spend some quality time with my family in the Wicklow Mountains. I really did unplug and recharge and this was only possible because I knew my customers were in safe hands... I knew you would give them 100% of your precious time and make sure everything was kept up to date. Its so lovely to come back and see emails confirming you have the jobs done and I'm using the time to get updates and not playing complete catch up!!! Thanks for making this possible. Enjoy!\n\n86#CSM Experts|Hi all, just wanted to take the time to send a thank you for all your help over the past number of weeks with our Bulk Shipping queries. The world is still crazy at the moment, especially with trying to ship packages all over the world, so thank you all for jumping in to help us with customer queries and also being quick to provide advise/feedback/resolutions. It a confusing process, but with your determination, we are able to work our way through the madness! Enjoy your awards:D\n\n87#Thank you bp!|A huge THANK YOU to this team for creating a video moment that is sure to touch the hearts of those at bp receiving it. This was a true team effort with lots of moving parts, but it was all worth it because the final product is incredible! Marie, thank you for having the idea to share a moment of thanks with our friends at bp and for not recording your message once, but twice to make sure it was the right tone and message for them. Derek, thank you for jumping in and creating a sentimental clip for bp, I am so thankful to have your lovely presence and demeanor in this special video. Owen, you are an all-star writer and since working on this project with you, I would call you a visionary! Your style and effort on this project has made the difference between an OK video, and a great one. This one is GREAT! Kristen, thanks for taking this a step further to create a lovely vehicle to get this video to bp from Marie, and for sharing your strategic thoughts through this process. Oh, and for suggesting a video vendor so I didn't have to learn the entire skill of making a video myself! :) Christina, thank you for managing this project and the workload of the team members to ensure we got the work done, and done right! We are certainly getting into a nice groove working together so often! Kylie, thank you for being a part of this and for making sure we had the perfect video clip to include that meshed with the rest of the video, even though you ended up recording your part twice! Lynette, thank you for being so flexible and getting the clip to me through several channels, and for recording it twice to make sure it meshed well in the video, RIGHT when you got back from your vacation!! This team deserves a huge round of applause for this project, and I can't wait to see this be a spring board for additional partnership with bp in so many areas! THANK YOU!\n\n88#Continental Cert Change|Kylie, thanks for your help with a recent continental SSO cert change. When I came back with questions and testing scenarios you were so quick to get the answers I needed and in the end have the client get their production environment sorted with the correct production certificate when needed. I have to say aswell that everytime we work together on a issue, i feel you offer the same amount of dedication to each of our clients everytime. Thanks so much for all you do 😁\n\n89#Going Strong and Staying Strong|Kylie, this statement is so you!!!! No matter what task you are on, you always want to ensure you are giving the customer (be it internal or external) 100%!  Also I just wanted to highlight how impressed I am at how you are ensuring our clients are getting the very best from Workhuman. In reality this means YOU. Evidence of this has come in examples such as Denso, your determination to ensure that we gave Sarah Fox (Senior Human Resources Generalist) full gratitude of thanking her to be part of WH Live where she explained how valuable Life Events is for their employees at this time, and what it means to them and as a way to show our gratitude you suggested that we have Eric send her a personal video to thank her for her contribution to WH Live, to delivering a 30 day post-launch partnership review this week for our biggest client launch in 2020 - Astrazeneca, showing them what we have achieved in this short period and getting them fully engaged on what the data is telling us!! Super work and well done! Keep it up.\n\n90#An Ode to Resilience|Hearing so much from clients these days about employee resilience so it became so obvious that we portray such resilience too. It is great to share and hear of client success and it is right to celebrate this but how do we get there? Kudos to Kylie for all her amazing, and to be honest, unseen work with Teva Pharma. We have been pushing water up a hill with a fork here for months but always kept pushing! Kylie has maintained an incredible level of professionalism and determination to keep them engaged. I was not surprised to see them record good growth and for the first time they are now social posting their program success. The tenacious work in the background here from Kylie is evidenced by this and we are in a much better place with them as we build the partnership this year. Well done Kylie!\n\n91#Customer Wrangler Extraordinaire|Kylie, much respect to you on getting us set up with Denso to talk about Life Events, but also closing out the approval process by facilitating that conversation. We had a million things on our plate the last few days, so with you on the case that piece was something that was not to be worried about. Thanks!\n\n92#AstraNomical Team|To each and every one that has worked on AstraZeneca's CatAlyZe recognition program, I cannot thank you enough!  We all know that every launch takes an entire team from start to finish.  With customers as detailed and focused as AstraZeneca, this launch was no exception.  They stretched and pulled us in a number of ways.  While we had to bend at times, we never broke.  At each new challenge, the team was able to overcome obstacles;  multiple rounds of approval rule changes, invoicing entities added, removed and changed,  and the WBAUs (More WBAUs than I care to count), merchant additions, subtractions and other adjustments.  On top of that, a month before launch, everyone on both sides of this project are all working from home!  While some launches have been delayed because of COVID-19, AstraZeneca's leadership team was committed to keeping their launch on track and because of everyone's efforts we were able to launch on May 4th, 2020 to 77,974 humans in 78 countries around the world! Thank you again and May the 4th be with you all!!!\n\n93#Denso's Life Events Newest Star|Kylie, all your hard work and determination has resulted in a successful roll-out of Life Events for Denso. Being one of the first team members to roll out this new feature it came with its own challenges but you took it all in your stride, working closely with our Specialists and I.T teams to ensure that the customer receives a fantastic addition to their current Workhuman Cloud platform!!  Its also great to see how you shared with the wider team your own personal experiences on what to look out for when running through the solution with the customer, things we can improve on when we are implementing and testing the solution so that other Customer Success Managers can benefit from your experience and follow in your footsteps when we deploy more customers in the coming weeks with Life Events! It was a joy to watch you get this new product feature over the finish line for Denso! Great work Kylie!!\n\n94#Bravo!|Kylie, I want to call out the above and beyond support you have been given to multiple clients over the last week, . You've had multiple escalations and you have worked late nights tirelessly to resolve issues with award cancellations and little horse deliveries :) to name a few. I want to call out one in particular in supporting Linkedin who are using our platform to recognize employees are doing great work in the relation to covid-19. When the PM called you late Wednesday evening to say they had provided incorrect data which would've meant missing the payroll deadline.  You quickly sprang into action and brought in the right folks to help get this resolved, quickly and efficiently for LI, so that employees would be getting their recognition moments for these important initiatives, on time. Well done and kudos to you and for the work you do for this important client!\n\n95#A Warm Welcome|Guys, I wanted to take the time to thank you for all the help and support you have provided over the past 3 weeks. You have all gone above & beyond to make me feel welcome and part of the team. You allowed me to shadow you on client calls, you gave me all the tools to successfully transition your old clients, you gave me precious tips on how to keep track of everything related to my new clients, you had 1-1's with me to give feedback and share knowledge, etc. I know I've only been part of the team for 3 weeks, but it feels like it's been way more than that! I'm grateful for the great team I have and I look forward to the work we will do together!\n\n96#Believe in Yourself, You are making a Difference!|Kylie, I just wanted to take a moment to highlight what amazing work you are doing for our customers. At times we can get bogged down in the weeds and it feels like we are not making a difference. The great thing is YOU ARE making a difference. With the recent challenges of Teva and their e-Commerce issues, battling merchandise challenges with Continental, ensuring we launch AstraZeneca successfully you are making your voice be heard and bringing your concerns to the front-line with the various Workhuman teams. This is an essential part of what we do at Customer Success at Workhuman! Never be afraid to speak up and ask for help, never be afraid to challenge the current ways of how we do our business with our customers. If we can’t allow you to be YOU then how can we embrace change. We will do great things in 2020 as a team but it’s only when we allow our colleagues to feel empowered can we make this journey together. Keep up the great work!\n\n97#First Inaugural CSM/Supportasauras Meetup|Kylie and Tracey, thanks for the fantastic idea and being part of the first ever inaugural CSM/Supportasauras meetup brunch. Even though there was only six of us at the start of this new tradition. This has sparked an exciting time for the working relationship between our two teams. We constantly work together but rarely get to celebrate together the success we have as two teams. To meetup in moments like this to share a laugh and chat and catch up on all the positives of what we do. It’s all part if us becomming a greater team and building stronger bonds as two teams. I look forward to continuing this tradition and adding more and more people and events along the way. Both our teams get through a monumental amount of work and are creating such fabulous moments. So its key to recognise all this. With probably about a tenth of the Workhuman employees working between our two teams there is countless ring the gong moments that we have accomplished. This is the first step in recognising this and building what could be a truly world class team spirit amongst us all. Thanks to you both for this wonderful idea :D\n\n98#Outstanding All Day Session|Many thanks Kylie for all your time and focus in the delivery of an exceptional session with AZ! As you well know, there was a lot of work in preparing the ground for Claire's visit and to ensure that we maximised her time. You did an outstanding job in leading all the prep work, logistics and delivery of her experience. I know just how much time goes into pulling off a successful visit like this and it was clear that Claire appreciated everyone's input and knowledge - THANK YOU for making Claire's visit such a success!\n\n99#Team 12: Brainstormin' with the BEST!|I want to thank you all for such a successful brainstorm session at Ignite! It was great having people from different teams come together to share ideas. First, it was nice to be in a smaller group of humans and get to meet some new friends. And it was so fun hearing about everyone's first job - we even had a nautical theme among the group. Then we dove into the brainstorm piece and the ideas were flowing. Everyone gets an A+ for participation, too! It is not always easy to share with people you just met, but this was not a challenge at all. Thanks for letting me brainstorm with the best!\n\n100#Taking charge with social feedback|Kylie & Shawn, this is a bit overdue but wanted to thank you both for taking the initiative in setting up a slack channel and calendar invites for the social feedback AIM we are working on.  Getting the small team off to a good start is important in helping to move things forward with this Q1 goal.  I appreciate your teamwork and focus in helping with kickstarting the creative process.\n\n101#Fellow Sushi Astronauts|Thanks to each of you for taking the time to leave the safe bubble of the hotel, then joining as a group for dinner at Fuji! It was great to get to know everyone better and to have the opportunity for some stimulating discussion. I look forward to seeing each of you again soon, and if anyone ever wants to do another sushi dinner in future just let me know!\n\n102#Yes and has come to life...|Team, I know it is difficult to take two mornings out of your week while you have Customer calls, emails and launches happening to attend a knowledge share workshop on some of our trickiest topics.  I must say it was impressive to see everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge building upon each other thoughts.  The collaboration among such a diverse group of people and roles  was simply amazing to be a part of and witness among a group of 40 strong.  If you were wondering what Respect for All looks like...you were just a part of it and each of you made it happen!  I would be remiss without calling out your contribution to moments that matter by agreeing to be present in our workshop and any other meeting moving forward.  We all know how it feels when someone/s is multi-tasks and I was so pleased to see laptops closed and true focus and attention on the subject and task at hand.  Thank you all for a great two days, I cannot wait to see what this Team does next.\n\n103#All together we succeed|Everyone, I wanted to recognise each of you for all you do when helping out the production support team. It has been another busy year, I for one cannot thank you all enough for everything you do to help out team out. There are countless small things that you all do that really make working here easier. There are countless things that are greatly appreciated and for those things I want to recognise you all. I still find it amazing how despite working across an ocean we have such a great comradery, friendship and can share laughs. I find it phenomenal just how much work we get through and the things we can achieve working side by side are incredible. No matter what we get the support we need and I know that together our team can give our customers a truly world class experience. Thank you all for being you and the teamwork you have displayed over the year. You are all the best :D\n\n104#R. E. S. P. E. C. T.|7 weeks in and I wished to extend the sincerest THANK YOU with all my heart, to each of you very kind humans for very warmly welcoming me to the Workhuman family.    Right back to my initial conversations with Stephen, email thread with Megan, my phone interview with Kate and onsite interviews with Niamh, MJ, Maeve, Rosana, Paul and Clare. There's no shadow of a doubt that testament to this 'best in class' recruiting journey, which each of you played a huge part in, you quickly affirmed to me that joining Workhuman would be one of the best decisions in my career and you were right!  Being part of the 17 strong Dublin new hire onboarding group, which I believe was the largest of 2019 and was excellently delivered by none other that this awesome pair; Caoimhe and Tanya.  Kindly taken under the wing of my amazing team; MJ and Paul who have been generous with their time and offering of support, which has greatly helped me hit the ground running.  All the phenomenal IT assistance demonstrated day in and day out by Ray, Eoin, Daniyal and Breon - lads ye are nothing short of LEGENDS!  And last but certainly far from least the trojan work that Aimee, Yvonne, Dympna, Wayne and their extended team do behind the scenes to provide us with the countless onsite luxuries and offsite off-the-chart parties aka Christmas!  In addition to the catering support you provide your expert advice on and quick turnarounds, plus your limitless patience accepting and notifying the Dublin humans of our daily deliveries which could certainly be described as 'Surprise n Delight' in their own right ;)  Plus everything else each of you do... because I appreciate this bitesize description doesn't even scratch the surface!  Which brings me up to today, where I feel truly grateful to be part of this family and I am beyond excited to experience the growth opportunities our Workhuman journey has in store for us - please continue to keep up the incredible work each of you are doing - #DreamTeam #FACT :)\n\n105#Importance of Partnership|Kylie thank you for your dedication to our customers, when a Christmas lunch with BP was first mentioned you were completely engaged with this and moved personal commitments around to ensure you'd be present on the day.  Thank you for your customer focus and always wanting to continue, nurture & grow relationships with our customers, you re doing a great job and are hugely valued as a partner by each of them!\n\n106#Persevering for BA|Kylie - thank you for the work you are doing with & for BA.  I hear you on calls with the team and the amount of work you do offline with internal colleagues and brainstorming possibilities for them to deliver on the many suggestions & requests they raise.  I understand from their perspective they would like the product to offer more or when they suggest a change that we instantly make it happen but this is not always feasible. Thank you for your patient & considerate approach discussing these items and providing alternative ideas, I really admire how you handle these conversations.  Well done Kylie, you are doing a great job!\n\n107#Participant recruiter|Thank you so much for organizing two groups of participants from BA and BP! You had to follow up with them multiple times, taking much time and effort. These will help us make informed decisions on what route to take with the program switcher.\n\n108#Customised solutions -troubleshooting - quality|Hi Kylie,  I would love to show how much I appreciate your help on moving clients to bulk in such a timely manner!   This is now 2nd client which was moved smoothly with your help since I have been involved in the process. It is an absolute pleasure to work with you.

Thank you :) Agi\n\n109#Program switcher - research help|Kylie,   I wish to thank you for your help with getting BP and BA for conducting research. We recently found out that we need to revisit the program switcher redesign as there were some usability issues. When we approached you with the request to get participants from BA and BP to help us validate our new designs you were on-board and very helpful! its extremely important for us to be able to validate with our customers the solutions we design to ensure that we are solving the right one! thank you :)\n\n110#Another great customer Case Study in the works!|Kylie and Marie, so excited to see the incredible relationship with BP cemented over the last year of painstaking work by both of you! Delighted to hear that Susan has agreed to memorialize their success in a case study with us. It takes a lot to bring a customer of any size to the table in true partnership but it takes master level skills to bring a company as complex and at the pure scale as BP. Super excited to see this come to fruition! Well done!!!\n\n111#Perseverance & Support|Kylie I would like to thank you for your fantastic support of our customers at various hours of the day. Last night you had a call with BP Australia to discuss a recent request.  Your dedication to our customers and how best to support them is truly excellent. I really appreciate the attention to detail that you show in all your dealings and the sense of urgency depending on the request.  You will always go above & beyond to deliver for them including timezone challenges. This engagement helps the wider program team and engages key folks on the customer side who are our program advocates on the ground. Thank you & well done!\n\n112#Referrals go live @BP|Kylie, well done on all the work you did to have referrals go live at BP this week! This was a complex request as there's a lot of product discussions & requests from BP for it to work a certain way which was not possible & you navigated your way through each conversation expertly to ensure you could deliver an experience which meets their requirements. How could have thought gemstone discussions could be so meaningful?! You did a great job, working with colleagues, researching possibilities, providing feedback on multiple programs & areas of opportunities for future development. This is a significant step for BP and shows the trust they have in the Energize experience, fantastic job Kylie, well done!!\n\n113#LinkedIn Transition|Kylie,  This award is long overdue!  I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for all of the work you've done to ensure an smooth transition with LinkedIn.

With everything going on and knowing how busy everyone is, I really appreciate you taking the time to do this for me!  Thank you again Kylie! Great teamwork!\n\n114#Brilliant at BP|Kylie- i wanted to reach out and thank you for your partnership at BP.  A great client, but truly a challenge, you have been all over getting resolution for their issues.  Taking on the bonus payment issue, working internally and with the client on payment, keeping everyone aware of the spend and calling out patterns that seem out of line plus many other fires.  You make sure you get resolution and in a timely manner.  I know all of the team at BP is happy to have you as their CSM and with great reason. Thank you for your communication with them and with me.  Appreciate the partnership!\n\n115#The best team|Thank you all so much for the support you gave me yesterday when I was snowed under with an important client push live - Jose- thank you for the sound advice and keeping me calm yesterday morning when there was one thing after another coming up with this client, Clarice and Kylie, thank you for picking up other urgent client issues that I couldn't get to as well and doing a lunch run me for me :)  you are the best colleagues, I really appreciate you.\n\n116#Thank you|Jose and Kylie, thank you so much for organizing a lovely surprise for my 5 yos!

A huge thank you to each of you for taking planes, trains and buses to a not so easy to get to 2 days of meetings. While everyone's delivery, content, knowledge and energy levels were confidence inspiring, I wanted to give a special call out to Lynette, Rich and Kylie for leading proceedings and for a top notch performance - thank you!!
