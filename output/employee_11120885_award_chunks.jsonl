"0#Thanks for the support!|Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped out in Paris. The video team was down a member and everyone here did their upmost to make sure that onsite video capture was a success. Any time I had questions you had answers, or were able to point me in the right direction. Always thankful to be part of such an amazing team!\n\n1#Soaring high in Paris!|I'm getting a bit tired of congratulating you all for (yet again) setting a new bar, but when you all helped pull off what was our largest and most impactful 3rd party event activation EVER, it has to be done!  This team absolutely crushed it last week, delivering two amazing back-to-back events with our first ever Workhuman Forum in Paris and then straight into UnleashWorld, where we dominated attendee mindshare. From the months of planning and design, to pre-event registration drives, meeting scheduling, and hospitality planning, to the flawless on-the-ground execution, it was an extraordinary end result.  The quality of engagement you all drove across an action-packed 3 days and nights doesn't just happen by chance. Every detail was sweated over. Every activity was well prepped and rehearsed. And the plan was orchestrated and delivered to perfection.  I couldn't be more proud of the effort put forth by you all and seeing the results of that effort take form. A sincere THANKS to all who contributed, with special thanks to our extraordinary Events team, who just set that new bar in how to show up big and deliver an extraordinary experience.\n\n2#Amazon Business - Business Testing Addresses|Thank you all for your support in finding addresses across the United States for our Amazon Business Testing. Your support has helped us validate assumptions and set our internal teams up for success, ahead of our scheduled launch in Early November.\n\n3#Clubhouse|Thanks to the best I&D crew ever. When the team needed another place to meet and space to brainstorm, you 3 brought your tools and the right attitude and built us an awesome new space for us to collaborate.\n\n4#Mission: Simplify|Jeff, thank you for carving out time from your already packed schedule to help me think through all the capture opportunities, simplify my thinking, and help build a clear, actionable plan for Forum/Unleash.  It’s yet another example of the kind of leadership you bring to our department.  Not loud (this time!), not flashy, but deeply impactful. I’m incredibly grateful for your guidance, generosity, and ability to make things feel manageable when they’re anything but.  Thank you for being the kind of teammate who lifts others up and leads by example.\n\n5#Stories|Jeff - it was such a great idea to ask the sales and CE team to tell their own stories about how WHL has worked for them. I know it's always a struggle to keep engagement up when there are so many competing priorities and this was a brilliant way to help frame it another way.\n\n6#Best QMR Ever???|I wanted to give a big shoutout to everyone who kept our Zoom chat buzzing during the QMR last week. You each provided thoughtful questions and comments, and your energy turned what could have been a long, one-way readout into a real conversation. That kind of engagement makes the whole department stronger—it shows curiosity, generosity, and a willingness to learn from each other.  Thank you for showing up ready to interact and helping set the tone for what these gatherings can be. Y'all know I have not loved previous QMRs – but this one was really great and your engagement was a huge part of what made it better! THANK YOU!\n\n7#Path to WHL 2026|Jeff & Anne, for taking the time to meet with Karen and me today to walk through logistics for the H2 direct mailer box and its tie-in to WHL. The information you shared was super helpful in clarifying next steps and giving us a better sense of what’s feasible. We really appreciate your insights and partnership as we shape this project! Looking forward to staying aligned as we move this forward and to creating a truly memorable journey for the contacts!\n\n8#Presenting partners|Just need to shout out what a stellar team this is!!! The process for creating our QMR presentation has become as seamless as our everyday work. From meeting altogether to align on what story we want to tell, to executing all the bits and pieces, this was a dream! Lisa, you made our slides fun and memorable and I can't thank you enough for doing the design lift so we could each focus on our individual talking points. Anne & Alana you both came to the table with such great content and it really helped us articulate the difference between creative success and business success when it comes to promoting WHLive. I know presenting is NOT either of your favorite, but it's clear that when you are the expert on the subject, you are both spectacular at it! I think my most valuable takeaway was going through all of our learnings just for ourselves – I mean, I hope it was useful to everyone else too – but it was a great exercise to just align within our own team on what really works and what doesnt! Cheers on what I think was the best QMR ever and a GREAT way to put the event team's best foot forward!\n\n9#Yesssss!!!!|Two meetings, two well prepared presentations, and two quick yeses. Quick yeses require lots of time, thoughtfulness, and preparation. You both came to these meetings with solid rationale, a concise talk track, and the right supporting documentation. I, and our senior stakeholders appreciate the great use of time and the proactiveness you both showed so that we can move the business forward.\n\n10#Strategy Sessions!|A huge thank you to this team for showing up with energy, fresh ideas, and the drive to run a mini sprint that got the beginnings of our plans down on paper. It’s easy for strategy to get lost in the day-to-day, but the thoughtfulness each of you brought to this work makes me confident we’ll bring these plans to life—and that they’ll not only make us more impactful and efficient, but also strengthen the goals of the marketing team as a whole.  Maya – your focus on process will ensure we get the most value from our speaker contracts. Anais – your strategic approach to content and ability to connect the dots across marketing programs is invaluable. Jeff – your leadership and support are key to helping us move these initiatives forward.  Thank you all for being true champions of our work!\n\n11#Jeff & Anne = Pre-Show Powerhouses|You know that feeling when everything just clicks? That was this partnership.  Flawless timelines? ✔️ Crystal-clear details? ✔️ Total trust to try something new? ✔️✔️✔️  You didn’t just keep things organized — you made space for magic. From early brainstorms to campaign launches, you gave us the freedom to push boundaries, break molds, and do things a little differently this year.  Every wild idea, every bold swing, every “can we pull this off?” moment — you were there, not just saying yes, but asking, “What else can we do?” That kind of trust is rare. Thank you for being the kind of partners who make bold feel easy, and big ideas feel possible.\n\n12#One more time...|Another event in the books.  I’ve lost count on how many we’ve worked on together between Monster and Workhuman.  Whatever the number, I am always grateful to work alongside you.  Thanks for pushing me to do better, reminding me when to delegate, and being a great friend.\n\n13#Master Scheduler|Jeff, as I told you a few weeks ago, the WHL schedule was a piece of art.  You are not only a Master Scheduler - you are a Jedi Master scheduler.  Thank you I must! Appreciate you I do!\n\n14#Heart and hustle|To everyone who traveled to Denver and rolled up their sleeves to support our flagship event—thank you.  There are dozens of jobs, big and small, that need to come together to make an event like this work—and you did them all. From demo delivering to activation staffing, room management to speaker wrangling, customer hosting to Gratitude Bar support—every task you took on was vital to the experience we delivered.  Your energy, flexibility, and willingness to step in wherever needed didn’t go unnoticed. This event’s success was built on your hard work, and we are deeply grateful for everything you gave—your time, your effort, your talent, and your care.  Thank you for showing up, again and again.  You made this event possible.\n\n15#An Extraordinary WHL|What you pulled off at Workhuman Live was nothing short of extraordinary. Every single detail—from the technology that powered the experience, to the stunning creative that framed our brand and our executives—was executed with precision, care, and excellence.  You created an environment that didn’t just look exceptional, but felt like Workhuman. The logistics, the operations, the room blocks, the speaker briefings, the attendee journeys—you orchestrated every piece with a level of rigor and creativity that made the impossible look effortless.  From the first pre-promotion touchpoint to the moment attendees walked into the space, to the content creation, the live on-site execution, the speaker curation and delivery, to the last-minute signage changes and the seamless video production—you owned it all. And you did it while managing thousands of humans moving through a complex environment, aligning every detail to our theme, our purpose, and our mission.  You brought Eric’s keynote to life with vision and thoughtfulness. You made sure our content tracks were cohesive, our speakers prepared and impactful, and our message loud and clear across every stage, room, and moment.  This was more than a flawless event. This was a defining moment of brand leadership—something only Workhuman could do, because of you.  I’m phenomenally proud of this team. Let’s carry this momentum into Orlando 2026. I already can’t wait.  —Richardtemp\n\n16#Workhuman Life Wizard|Has anyone told you lately what an amazing job are you doing getting us ready for Workhuman Live? I am loving the nudges, the messages, reminders and pinned information in the Going to Denver Slack channel. And, I just went through your email about the CxO dinner. All the information I need is there. Talking points plus that AMAZING spreadsheet with head shots and notes. I am excited about my dinner group and I can tell that my group was thoughtfully chosen with me in mind. This is a hectic stressful time, so thank you so much for all you do to get us prepared and ready.\n\n17#Built with Heart, Powered by You|Before the lights go up, before we scan the first of the best conferance badges ever, before a single speaker takes the stage—there's something that absolutely must be said:  Thank you.  This team has already achieved something remarkable. The creativity, precision, late nights, and tireless problem-solving you've poured into this event are the foundation of its success—regardless of what happens once the doors open. You've turned strategy into schedules, ideas into experiences, and ambition into execution. WHL is the culmination of your brilliance and hard work.  This recognition isn’t for what might happen next. It’s for everything you've done to make this moment possible. Your work has already made us proud. And now, it’s time to bring it to life.  Let’s go make some magic—but know that the real magic? That already happened, behind the scenes, together.\n\n18#That's So Jeff...|There might be a lot of 'Jeff-isms' but the best one to me is 'Jeffinitely'. You Jeffinitely prove to always be a team player. You Jeffinitely are always there for support, guidance and to lend helping hand where needed. And you Jeffinitely know how to work hard but have a great time while doing so. I just want to say thank you for all your support leading up to WHL. Whether that has been with the CXO Dinner, weekly assistance with updates, or just answering any and every question I send your way. I appreciate the partnership and friendship a ton! Cheers to you killing it in the Rockies!\n\n19#The Most PERFECT Conference Badge -- EVER|It's been 10 years in the making...we've laughed, we've cried, we've fought, I've pouted, but we've finally done it! The new badges for Workhuman Live 2025 are great. It is the perfect font, font size, boldness, background, color contrast for the first name and the company name. The badge colors and people icons add the right amount of attendee information to help us prioritize are interactions at the event. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our needs and to make it happen for this year's event. It will make a world of difference for us all at the event!\n\n20#You are Marvelous!!!|As we rapidly inch closer to our 10th Workhuman Live in Denver, Colorado there have already been thousands of hours logged in support of another successful event.  While evangelizing to those we want to enjoy the experience, it takes an entire team to pull together the WHL packages, microsites, and video mailers to create special moments before our guests finally arrive.  I want you to know how much your effort is appreciated for all that you do, and would like to take a moment to say \"Thank You\" 👏🏼\n\n21#Best Promo Ever!|Well.... best email open rate and click through rate for all Workhuman Live 2025 promotions.  This one knocked it out of the park.  It was a last minute addition to the schedule, and caused some email shuffling and work re-prioritzation.  But the effort paid off - this email drove interest and action to check out the website.  Hopefully the registrations will follow.  Thanks to all who helped get this one out the door!\n\n22#AM Huddles|Jeff, I'm not a morning person AT ALL. But when I do come in early, I appreciate having you there for those early morning huddles. Our chats are productive and have resulted in clarity, simplification, and improved process for Workhuman Live. Thank you!\n\n23#We > Me|A hearty thank you to Jeff, Alessandra, Haley, Allie, and James for participating and presenting at this week's Brand Onsite in Framingham. We appreciate your time and collaboration. Thank you for sharing your wisdom. It strengthens our cross-functional understanding and certainly will lead to good progress on our integrated projects. High Five!\n\n24#Forum London Staffing|Thank you for showing up in London! When assigned a shift(s) to support the event you stepped up, showed up, and helped create a memorable experience for our attendees. Cheers!\n\n25#\"How can I help?\"|A shout out to this team who always happy to help. The days leading up to an event are always stressful, but each person here checked in to see what you could help with, whether it was helping move 70 pound crates, finding a pair of scissors, helping manage the 500 person queue, or even just keeping us hydrated. You all make sure no one is ever left behind. I appreciate you all!\n\n26#The Big Cheese? More like the Big Picture|Thank you for recommending that I share insights from the Human Intelligence Landing Page launch with relevant marketing teams. I reviewed the Demand Gen webinar landing pages and was able to identify potentially game-changing opportunities, not to mention create a bridge between our teams. Your ability to see the forest for the trees—and your strategic guidance—are invaluable!\n\n27#Forum Staff Brief!|A big thank you to all my co-presenters for the London Forum Staff Briefing! Helping everyone come together before a big event has a huge impact on the collective excellence we can provide when we get onsite! The one-team, one-dream effort is off to a great start and the energy everyone is bringing this year has me so excited! Maybe 3rd year is the charm? I jsut have this feeling it's going to be the best one yet and everyone's preparation and communication is so appreciated. Thank you all for supporting this effort!!! #TeamForum!!!!!!!\n\n28#Up, up, and away!|Anne & Jeff, you've become my favorites this year as we've tackled aspects of WHL for customers. I am grateful for the authentic conversations we've had, your flexibility with the 'plan', and quick action on requests that have come through with short notice. Sometimes, like this photo, it feels like we are building the plane while flying it. On the spectrum of critically cautious to dare devil, I think we know where you land. Thank you for being great partners to me.\n\n29#Interview Dream Team!!!!!!!!!!!!!|HUGE shoutout to this crew for being a rockstar interview panel.  Juggling the logistics of three onsite interviews in a short amount of time is no easy task (not to mention room switches and multiple interviews in the same day).  I can't express how much I appreciate you all taking the time to not only interview, but provide such quality feedback (which was so incredibly impactful in making a hiring decision!!!!!).  Thank you all for being such great hiring partners!\n\n30#Game Winners|Wanted to take a minute to recognize you all for a recent win. As a team we came together to discuss the pros and cons of gamification in the WHL event app. We considered conference goals; we considered attendee experience; and we considered our own workload. We ultimately made the courageous decision NOT to do something that we've done year over year just because we can. This decision will reduce complexity for attendees and will let us shine a more focused light on our Gratitude Bar product simulation, putting us on a path to increased recognition & redemption moments and attendee engagement.\n\n31#Good Partnership|Thank you, Ashley, Jeff, and Jill for your fantastic partnership on the Human Intelligence 2025 Release creative development. To Ashley, we appreciate your clear, smart brief. To Jeff, thanks for sharing your experience and the way you provide productive, considerate feedback. And to Jill, for trusting the brand creative team to deliver. Really looking forward to seeing this integrated campaign to life.\n\n32#Supreme Collaboration for Accelerated GTM Planning|Just want to start this off by saying this is an incredible group of people. I have been constantly amazed and impressed throughout this past month+ by this group's ability to collaborate decisively to organize and take action on the Marketing plan for the Human Intelligence 2025 Release.  I've been so inspired by how you all quickly acted to present innovative plans for the Human Intelligence launch to only then act even quicker to move forward with execution. In the weeks leading up to the holidays, you all have worked together to brainstorm, workshop, and problem-solve, all while respecting the necessary work-life balance people need to enjoy the holidays for family and friends.  My experience working with you all this project thus far has me extremely excited about what we will accomplish in 2025. I really appreciate the way this group conducts itself and couldn't be more proud to be a part of it.\n\n33#My heart grew three sizes that day...|Yesterday, we held an informal WHL update meeting. When it ended, the team applauded. What an amazing show of support and camaraderie. Just like the grinch, my heart grew three sizes!    And now I applaud you. This event is successful because of this team's contributions, collaboration, passion, and leadership.\n\n34#Starting from scratch|Jeff & Ashley, I just wanted to say you've done a great job building a foundation for a sponsorship program, keeping the ball rolling as we struggled to find the right partner, and pulling together all the components we will need if - I mean WHEN - we get one sold!\n\n35#October NYCU trivia winners!|Thank you for your patience and dedication to News You Can Use, the monthly enablement newletter! You answered the last edition of trivia correctly and humored me with your fast candy responses. Everyone loves chocolate! Happy holidays 🍾\n\n36#Thank you!|Before we head out for the holidays, I wanted to be sure I recognized you both for the warm welcome back into the WHL World! You have been amazing partners - providing data, resources, and your time. I am so happy to be collaborating once again with a renewed lens and collective spirit!\n\n37#Workhuman Live Forum - wheels up!|Kudos team - you did it! Building the site, setting up the reg process, as well as creating enablement tools and paid media assets amongst competing priorities during a busy time of year was not easy - and phew - is a big deal. Thank you for your commitment to the work - even beating the launch date! The EMEA team is well set up to drive registrations to the event. Wheels up for elevation!\n\n38#Moving Fast and Breaking Norms|Team, over the past two weeks, you’ve truly embodied the spirit of “Move Fast and Break Things.” Your efforts in shaping innovative concepts for the 2025 Human Intelligence Release and the Brené Brown Roadshow are nothing short of extraordinary (in line with record approval timelines)  You’ve shattered conventional thinking, embraced greater risk with a bold vision and experimentation (untested) with new approaches — all while maintaining your deep understanding of digital and event execution. By leading with positivity and opportunity, you are not just breaking execution norms but rebuilding them in ways that inspire and ignite transformation and culture within the team.   You’re not just moving fast; you’re moving forward, and the ripple effect of your positivity and innovation is already evident in the direction we're moving and the \"insider speak\" about these projects.   Thank you for your courage, your passion, and your ability to take our ideas to new heights. Let’s keep the momentum going!\n\n39#Herding the cats|You might be our official events cat-herder. At least when the cats are me, Jill, and James! You have been such a steady presence of awesome over the past few weeks. Whether it was starting a deck for the team to pour into, or doing the number crunching for those of us who are not math-peeps, or coming up with projected budgets, or taking notes in meetings – you've been the backbone to all our creative ideas becoming real things people can sign off on. AND I know you're moving your kid across the country next week, so it's not like you don't have other things on your mind!!! I appreciate you spending so much of your brain power on supporting the team!!\n\n40#Team WHL 🦃|Thankful to all of you for being collaborative partners, creative thinkers, and just generally fun humans to be around. The past few months of Workhuman Live prep have been some of the most challenging and most fun to work on yet - and I couldn’t ask for a better team to tackle it with. Grateful for all of you ❤️❤️\n\n41#Good friends and trusted advisors|I just wanted to thank you for all of the feedback you gave me this week for a speaking opportunity that I was nervous about. Your thoughts on the words as well as your support and encouragement really helped my confidence level. You are all so generous with your time to help me and one another - I'm just so grateful for you three.\n\n42#...and we're live!|Special shout out to this team in getting our new housing experience up for Workhuman Live. From email confirmations to site design tweaks, your expertise helps make the best possible experience for our attendees. Thank you!\n\n43#September NYCU winners 🎉|Thank you for your participation and engagement in the September edition of News You Can Use, the Growth Content newsletter! You all answered this month’s trivia first with the correct answer.\n\n44#Flower Power|This team has it all. Integrity, passion, desire for the best outcomes and most of all kindness.  You all were more than willing to help and execute anything and everything that was needed.  Tradeshow days are long but you never wavered in your willingness to be there for your teammates from show start to show end.   Most of all-you are all a blast to work with and that makes it all easier!\n\n45#Unleash Booth Theater Crew|Thank you team for your on-site help with the unleash booth theater. We are so proud of the success of these sessions which wouldn’t have been possible without you!\n\n46#Giving flowers to my Parisian pals|I cannot thanks this group enough for everything this week! From travel buddies, to booth clean up, you all were by my side. You all are the definition of \"teamwork\"; whenever an issue arose or there was work to be done or even just a morale boost was needed, there was no hesitation before you stepped into help. THANK YOU!\n\n47#Speaker Success Squad!|Jeff, Anne, and Emily, I just wanted to express my gratitude for your dedication to supporting my team and helping us maximize the potential promo reach of our speakers. We pack a lot into these contracts, and your efforts to coordinate with various marketing departments are instrumental in making sure we collectively tap into every opportunity. We know it's no small feat to bring all these moving parts together, and we're truly grateful for your partnership!\n\n48#Unleash Calls|Thanks to all of you for helping out with the Unleash calls this week. Each of you played a role in scheduling, prepping, and/or presenting and your support is greatly appreciated.\n\n49#MillerKnoll Marathon for the Win!|MillerKnoll is officially WON! This $2.050M YOS and Celebrations program has provided lessons learned and is a testament to the team’s resilience in the face of adversity and delays. 15 months and 26 Workhuman Team Members running this Marathon, Brandon Warner was the pace setter, and he couldn’t have done this without this team, who rallied and shared the same tenacious spirit. The MillerKnoll journey began with Lisa Landon, whose positive impact on a contact from another company, created the spark that ignited this opportunity. Then the departure of key contacts at MillerKnoll posed significant challenges, requiring Brandon to re-establish new executive relationships from scratch. Many thanks to Connor for his partnership in prospecting new contacts! Maggie and Naomi provided the type of consultancy that was second to none on this journey. Jillian Petro made sure the 1:1 ABM support was flawless, noting that this is her first ABM win for Corporate Sales. Thank you to Chris and Owen for a brilliantly crafted mood video and to Brian for a fantastic custom demo site. Jess Klay also joined a leg of this run pulling fabrics utilized in our new offices with a MillerKnoll brand attached to it.  As most marathon’s go, there is a runner’s high and with the relationships re-established, Jeff, Anne and Brenda helped pull out the stops for us at WHL.  Q2 Finish Line steps away... the CFO required a market assessment for pricing, leading to a \"light\" RFP. Our RFP team, Michael and Anna guided us along with our Finance Team Chuck and Chris to facilitate price modeling and of course Tom & Jen to strategize! Our E-Comm team was integral in positioning various needs; many thanks to Mindi and Audrey.  This Marathon wasn't complete without Legal and our IT Teams! In this case the one document causing the bumps in our road was the DPA. Of course, Orlagh, Nuvs and Matt in partnership with Christy Hillary, Dan and Nick got us to the finish line!\n\n50#WHL Early Bird Goal - Achieved|It's the first milestone of many for Workhuman Live - and this team crushed it.  We reached 300 registrations for Workhuman Live 2025 before the official website is even launched!  This achievement puts us well on our way to our (very lofty) total registration goals for the year.  None of it could be accomplished without each and every person on this team.  Thanks to everyone for the dedication, collaboration and creativity.\n\n51#ALL THE MEETINGS!!!|Y'all have been such great partners over the last bunch of weeks (and months!) in getting all the discovery together for Workhuman Live. It's a lot of meetings and thinking and trying to figure out what we need out of all our cross functional partners. I'm so used to my own creative process that I can sometimes forget to explain why or how I'm thinking about something, the angle I want to take it in from. It can be hard for me to articulate exactly what it is I'm looking for – and I know how awful it is when someone tells you, \"I'll know it when I see it!\" I'm so appreciative of all the hard conversations we had – and the respectful ways we disagree. It pushes me to question things I do out of habit and make sure I'm really adding value. You stretch my understanding to think bigger about the event(s) strategically and I appreciate all the time, effort, and energy you put into organizing these sessions. I did know it when I saw it – that last session was a gold mine!!! I feel like we are more aligned and positioned for success than we've ever been!!! Thank you both a million for doing all the things that you do!!!\n\n52#Feedback from friends|Laura & Jeff, understanding you both have jam-packed schedules makes me even more appreciative that you've taken time to review my ERG project and share thoughtful and insightful feedback with me. It means a lot to have two marketing professionals I admire review and critique my work - thank you!!\n\n53#Drumroll for the Drum Awards|Thanks to this team for working diligently and at warp speed to complete the submission requirements for the Drum Awards.  Because of your efforts outlining all the Workhuman Live 2024 achievements we were able to submit for three categories for consideration.  Workhuman Live is an unparalleled event (in my humble opinion) and I'm confident that the Drum Awards will recognize the efforts of our entire team when the results are in.  Fingers crossed!\n\n54#That's a Wrap|The 2024 Spotlight Series just wrapped up! The 2nd and 3rd episodes were only a month apart! Thank you for your participation. The work started almost a year ago and each of you said 'Yes' to your role, whether it was work that spanned over the year, or involved being recorded for a segment. A lot of work goes into this event - planning, sourcing, promo, web, tech support, scripting, recordings, post-production. The list is long, and so is the list of humans who support this event. The team learned and pivoted over the year, modified the segments, adjusted the promo, never gave up on sourcing speakers, got creative with recording locations, and masterfully edited the episodes to include the best of the best content. Spotlight is the bass guitar of the Events portfolio - the important steady beat supporting our message and a platform to share it with the world. Cheers to all of you!\n\n55#All the small things|I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of you for what outstanding team members you all are. Your dedication to helping each other and collaborating with other teams and stakeholders ensures that every event we handle is a resounding success. Your commitment to excellence is evident in every detail of your work and to all of our attendees no matter what event you are working on. Your teamwork and unwavering support for one another set a high standard and make our collective achievements possible. And you do it all with grace, positive attitudes, and maybe most importantly, lots of laughs.\n\n56#Offer Accepted|We have a new Sr. Specialist hired for the Event Marketing team. Thank you to this stellar hiring panel for taking the time to interview multiple candidates, focusing your questions on the specific hiring criteria assigned and sharing candid feedback.  Because of your efforts, we were able to get a full view of each candidate's qualifications and will be able to get Emily onboarded as we ramp up our promotions for Workhuman Live 2025.\n\n57#Paying my dues!|It's long overdue and seems only appropriate that my first Spark award goes to all of you!   For all the collaboration, teamwork, support, awesomeness and big laughs over the past few years that I wasn't able to recognize through the platform! Glad to be part of this team!\n\n58#Thank you for your support!|Jeff - a quick thank you for always seeing the value in what my team does, and being there to lend a helping hand, advice, support and communicating alongside us. You always come to conversations with an open mind, creative ideas and positivity. I appreciate your partnership, fully!\n\n59#In the midst of brilliance|As we reflect on the resounding success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I am compelled to extend my deepest gratitude and admiration to each of you. Your leadership has been instrumental in turning a bold vision into an awe-inspiring reality, cementing its status as the premier conference for business leaders worldwide.  Your meticulous attention to every facet of the event, from pre-promotion, central, design & experience to speakers, technology, production, communications and surrounding events, has transformed ambitious ideas into a seamless experience for over 3,000 attendees. Your ability to orchestrate, collaborate, and innovate—while setting egos aside—has not only elevated our brand and the WHL \"product\" but has also reinforced our promise to the community we serve.  The dedication, creativity, and problem-solving skills you displayed were pivotal in crafting an event that not only met but surpassed expectations. The quality of the keynote speakers, the depth of the sessions, and the flawless overall execution ensured that every participant left feeling connected and inspired. Your efforts have strengthened our relationships with customers, partners, and prospects while enriching the HR community and paving the way for new opportunities in pipeline creation and customer retention. The spirit of collaboration and inclusivity you fostered has set a new benchmark for excellence and showcased the true essence of Workhuman.  I am truly grateful for your hard work, passion, and unwavering commitment to excellence. I'm so proud to have you on ALL on the team. Thank you, every one of you, for your significant contributions.   Richard\n\n60#Owning the Water Cooler|You not only worked at the Water Cooler, you OWNED it! You learned how to run it, helped build it, greeted each visitor with a smile, made connections, collected info on what matters to our guests and worked together over the 2.5 days to make sure there was a human to greet our attendees. Not your 'day job', but you embraced it. Cheers to you!\n\n61#Welcoming newcomers|Thank you all for your support of the Newcomers on Tour at WHL. This was a new activity this year that we developed to support a specific attendee journey. As with all new ideas, it required a lot of work behind the scenes to plan & develop and it required a lot of humanpower to pull it off onsite. Thank you to everyone who helped create and market the experience. Thank you to our hostesses who guarded the doors and shepherded the attendees onsite. And thank you to our fearless tour guides for making the experience educational and entertaining for attendees.\n\n62#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders.

This required a great deal of cross-functional collaboration and I deeply appreciate how all of these teams came together and supported one another to create a stunning web page, powerful marketing campaigns, and impactful enablement for our internal teams as well as our customers.  All of this effort goes a long way towards advancing Workhuman's innovation reputation and further separating us from the competition. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\n\n64#Little things that matter!|Nicole, Jose, Erin, Jeff, Ashley and Jill - thank you for helping me with the many little things that needed attention to ensure a smooth experience for the customers as well as myself at Workhuman Live the past week. From coordinating parking passes for the CDO, to getting creative with me to ensure prime seats were reserved for our VIP guests, to correcting my name on the app to avoid confusing customers, to taking notice that I wasn’t keeping myself nourished while running around, to making sure my water cooler reservations accommodated the large Execuitve group, to making sure my hotel booking was done correctly… the list goes on! These may seem like small things but they each had a big impact in the audience that was involved. Every little thing adds up to a collective experience and I appreciate each one of you for making it easier for me to deliver a flawless one. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!\n\n65#Excellence in Leadership|Taking a moment during the (somewhat) calm before the storm to recognize and thank you both for your leadership.  As we head into the final weeks before Austin, I want to recognize you both for the quiet things you do daily to keep the team motivated, priorities in check, and ensure we offer our attendees the very best experience.  I am grateful to be a part of this kick a$$ team.\n\n66#1 month from today|1 month from today, Workhuman Live 2024 will be over. That means right now you are swamped, probably stressed, maybe losing sleep, keeping track of 100 things. AND building Workhuman Live Forum, wheels turning on a couple Spotlights, plus ramping up Workhuman Live 2025. Its a lot! Keep breathing, doing great work, with FOCUS ;-) on the month ahead. The finish line is coming into view. You can do it. Thank you for your dedication, commitment, and perseverance. Best. Team.

Your efforts have made a significant difference, and I am truly thankful for everything you do.\n\n68#Thank you, Jeff!!!|Jeff, your swift action and unwavering commitment to excellence continue to inspire us all. Thank you for stepping up and joining the \"I need help with the agenda and plan for Workhuman Live\" prospect call for Medical Mutual, where the stakes were high with the CPO, the VP of HR, and three other leaders in attendance. Your ability to address their questions promptly and effectively, while also providing valuable guidance on maximizing their time at Workhuman Live, is a testament to your expertise and dedication. Furthermore, your dedication to answering ALL of the IMs and emails I have sent 😊regarding other requests coming in showcases your unparalleled dedication to our team and our prospects.

Thank you all for truly showing up for this teammate. In the words of Barbie, “I want to do the imagining, not be the idea\" - super grateful I get to spend time doing the imagining with you all!\n\n72#The king of accountability|Thank you for always keeping everyone accountable. For our Fortune article on recognition, I really appreciated your nudge to include Workhuman Live in the content. While it was a natural fit for the piece, you were amenable to some more creative ways to promote WHL, and with your blessing, have decided to utilize social media promotion of the piece to spotlight the event. We’re also creating display ads to reflect the content of the piece, pointing to WHL as the solution to the workplace culture problem. I always enjoy collaborating with you and your team, and the always-on push to be and think better.\n\n73#Always raising your hand|Jeff, I can't even count the times you raise your hand to take on a new initiative, solve a problem, participate on a committee or just ask \"what can I help you with\". I spend a lot of time taking advantage of your knowledge and generosity with your time and I wanted to make sure I spent some time thanking you for all of it. I appreciate all of your efforts and knowing that I can count on you through it all.\n\n74#A+ Coverage|Thank you so much for covering for me last week when I was on PTO!

I was quickly able to pick back up on Monday thanks to your support and I'm very grateful!\n\n75#Guardian Life - Won at $2.5M!|Excited to Share that Guardian Life was just closed won by Jenn Brauer for $2.5M!  3rd times a charm as there were two previous opportunities attempted in 2014 and 2017!  This time around the Opportunity has been in the making for 2 years with a group of 8 from Guardian Life attending Workhuman Live 2 years in a row, thank you Anne LaFond and Jeff Graham for your support in curating teams packages for multiple years (Can’t wait to welcome their team as a Customer to WHL in 2024!).  There were 5 strategic advisors, integral to this Win, interacting on 21 occasions to facilitate conversations around investment, what good looks like, how to navigate the launch process and change management strategies among many other topics!  Thank you, David Stott, Maggie Daley, Hari Date, Corinne Selk, and Marci Ricci.  Jenn Brauer masterfully took over the conversation and relationship with Guardian when we needed her passion to shine for the RFP demo and get us to VOC. Having a terrific demo customized, no doubt had its impact; Thank you to Brian Moore! Of course, we would have never gotten to a finalist demo without the skills of Anna Chmura and Michael Robb to articulate our solution and differentiators in the RFP response! In the background running campaigns was Larry Dennison from ABM to insure they knew our alignment in Financial Services was strong, Achievers was no match for us, and hit a key driver of theirs with the Unified Culture campaign! None of this would have occurred without the commercial term negotiations via Chuck Labovitz, or the legal and security review, edits, exhibits and clarifying emails from Emily Smith, Hillary Mahoney, and Orlagh Lynch.  Of course, no deal is complete without the strategic support from Tom V!  All throughout, Jenn continuously stayed on top of the requests, the process and social surround needed to win this deal.   Congratulations on making plan Jenn and this Win getting you to a sunny spot in Aruba @ Club!\n\n76#League of Legends|This award has been a long time coming - I really wanted to thank the three of you for being such great teammates and partners on all things WHL promo. Post creative reorg, I’ve felt lucky because it never felt like much changed for us on events. You’ve always made us feel like we’re part of a team vs. a traditional client / creative relationship. I appreciate how collaborative and open you all are to trying new things, your willingness to throw in a Taylor swift joke or two, and communication throughout. You are truly a dream “client” for me, and I can’t wait to see what we’re able to do together over the next year and beyond. Thanks!!\n\n77#Believe!!|A shout-out to a great team -- thank you all for taking the time to read our (lengthy!) newsletter (and all the way to the end to the secret password!)

Even though we might not always have an immediate response to that info, it is always acknowledged.  \t 3.\tI’m in awe of your ability to handle stress. Regardless of whether you’re working with less-than-ideal sleep, in a house undergoing an extreme makeover, with a hundred other things going on in your life, you rarely ever let those factors influence your behavior at work. You approach interactions with empathy and an open mind, always weighing risks and opportunities in a transparent manner. It’s a valuable trait that I hope to emulate as I grow into my career!\n\n95#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.

Jeff - We come to you often with a lot of questions and your expertise and meetings to brainstorm with us has been a key factor in getting this community up and running at Live.

These terms are used frequently in the corporate world and are mostly said but not practiced. You  all show these qualities every day in everything you do. The collaboration, kindness, understanding, and respect that you show each other day is what makes this team great and has a palpable impact on the events we produced. We have a huge first quarter coming up and will surely face all the pressures that live events bring. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for the work you have done and the work you will do. The culture you have created will get us through it all and create incredible events.\n\n111#Calling the bluff on the river, twice!|Two Rivers! Two Contracts! Two “wins”. This week we had two contracts “on the River” with Cameo and Gallup - all the negotiation cards on the board with no other options on the table. In these high stakes negotiations, being educated on the nuances of the proposed deliverables, the standard operating procedures of the business, the common attitude to fiscal responsibility, all parties knowing where the workhuman risk line, etc is absolutely critical when calling the bluff in a negotiation when a new hand is show.   You were educated and strategic and took two contracts from the brink of death to signed / sealed / and delivered. I couldn’t be more proud of you all. Well done.\n\n112#First Graduating Class of Spark Director+ !|Congratulations to our pilot class of Spark Director+, Workhuman's first-ever leadership development program catered specifically to our Director and Senior Director population!

Thank you, graduates, for investing time in your own development!\n\n113#✨ Spark Director+  [Psychological Safety] ✨|💡 \" Psychological Safety is a shared belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.” – Amy Edmondson.     📊 In 2012, Google embarked on a quest to build the Perfect Team. An initiative code-named Project Aristotle studied hundreds of Google’s teams to better understand why some stumbled, whilst others soared. Google’s extensive research corroborated the importance of Amy Edmondson's coined phrase, discovering that Psychological Safety is a paramount component of High Performing Teams.   ⚠️ Building a fearless organization that truly embraces psychological safety will leverage the benefits of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), attracting and retaining a diverse environment of talented individuals, in addition to promoting innovation, connection, and a sense of belonging (DEIB).   🚀 Spark Director+ is a self-discovery journey within an overarching Leadership Learning Track, offered to Directors and Senior Directors who manage teams of all sizes.   📢 Please join me in applauding our enthusiastic Workhuman Executive Leaders who participated in this month’s Psychological Safety module: Adam, Amy, Andrew, Colleen, Jason, Jeff, Laura, Linda, Martina, Michelle Drozdowski, Michelle Lane, Michelle McDaid, Niall, Rich, Tyler, Varun, and Zhennaa, thank you for your valued partnership as Psychological Safety Ambassadors.

By the numbers, this milestone represents two-year growth from 8,000 in 2020 to 50,636 (and climbing)! That’s an incredible 532% increase in demand growth in just two years' time!     The journey to this massive accomplishment started back in October 2021 with thoughtful and intense demand and brand planning, pragmatism of breaking big goals into smaller channel by quarter forecasts and plans, followed by superior discipline around performance management week on week, and critically aided by our partnerships with Sales Ops, Analytics, and Enterprise Architecture.     From web leads, to webinars, social surrounds, press amplification, Spotlights, and countless hours refining the leads scoring and ingestion models, this was a department wide effort through and through. As impressive as this achievement of goal (ahead of schedule) is, more than the outcome itself, it’s demonstrative of your collective discipline, collaboration, and commitment to quality execution. We’ve learned much from this journey that will inform and enable success in fy23 and beyond.     On behalf of the Senior Exec Leadership Team, congratulations on making the impossible, possible!    -Tom\n\n115#Marketing Analytics Stakeholder Resiliency|A big thank you to this team for your partnership and resiliency in all things events data.

Looking forward to partnering with all of you as we continue to build towards San Diego in April!\n\n118#Representing|Thank you for representing the Events PM role during recent 2023 Planning and Process Improvement meetings, and making sure my POV was in the room. Of course that included listening to said POV in advance ;-) I appreciate your time and commitment to making the way we work even better. Cheers.\n\n119#Strategic Planning ROCKSTARS!|Team,  Van Gough once said \"great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" Each of you brought your ideas, your energy, and a spirit of collaboration to the strategic planning sessions this week, which will unequivocally set our marketing organization up to do great things in 2023. It was a large commitment of your time and your active engagement with the goal of developing a collective and transparent foundation for next years plan. So, a sincere thanks to all for both making that commitment and demonstrating that together we can, and will continue to, deliver as a true team.  Tom\n\n120#Taking the lead|Thank you for taking the lead preparing decks for the multiple planning meetings coming up. Much of the work fell on you, as I have been trying to figure out our new events and headcount and I wanted you to know how much I appreciate you. All presentations are expertly done and so well thought out. There is no better partner than you.\n\n121#United|Thank you for jumping on a call yesterday to align before a meeting about web process. We are a team. We share the same goals. We have the same challenges and stressors. We work together to find solutions. I'm thankful for the Events team every day - and that's YOU!\n\n122#Take the chill pill man!|Jeff, thank you for helping me relax last night while we were waiting for CVENT to respond with an update on their progress. There's been so much pressure to get the site live over the past few weeks that I was ready to do just about anything to hit our early morning target. Your late-night Slack message helped me realize that the final puzzle piece (CVENT) was out of our hands and that I should use the opportunity to chill, recharge, and approach today with a centered mindset.\n\n123#Part 1: Plan the Work|Part 2: Work the Plan. Excited to celebrate and recognize this cross-functional group's efforts as we exit Q3, head toward Q4, and chart a path to more growth in 2023. You've all together demonstrated great teamwork, autonomy, leadership, healthy challenge and debate, and a disciplined and data-driven approach to 2023 draft plans which will ultimately be vetted with partner teams to form the basis for strong operating plans aimed at New Customer Growth, Customer Retention, Innovation, and an ongoing focus of putting the human in Workhuman. Congrats on great progress in Part 1. Excited to finalize it and head toward Part 2! -With gratitude, Richard and Chris\n\n124#Together we can do hard things|Jeff- just want to say how much I love working with you, because whether we’re completely aligned and excited about what we’re doing, or totally disagree- we can have a laugh and talk things through. You have a way of sharing your honest opinion without judgement, and I so very much appreciate and respect your POV and experience.\n\n125#2023 Strategy Session #1|Team - thank you for spend the afternoon together in an engaging discussion around brand, content and comms strategy. While we didn't get through the entire agenda, I am grateful for the sharing, learning and dialogue that took place. Your input will help shape future sessions as we continue through this journey, building stronger ties between our respective teams and making decisions that help us operate more efficiently and move the department and ultimately, the business forward. I hope you're as energized and excited as I am about making more progress over the next several weeks to finalize our strategic marketing plan for 2023. THANK YOU ALL!\n\n126#Got a Minute?|I call on all of you so often, asking for a minute of your time that usually turns into 15 or 30 - sometimes even a lot longer. And you all always say yes, making time to collaborate, provide feedback, bounce ideas around. Thank you for your generosity - of your time and your thoughtful insights. I appreciate you for your constant support that helps me through business decisions, improving projects, and sometimes just everyday life.\n\n127#R-E-S-P-E-C-T|Jeff, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you for being such a great leader, teammate, and last but not least, listener. You’re someone I can always turn to when I need to express any challenges I’m seeing, and you truly listen to my point of view. You have an incredible ability to synthesize feedback from all angles and reach logical compromises so that the team & project can continue to move forward. As you know very well, working on an event with as many moving parts as Workhuman Live requires utmost communication, collaboration and respect for one another to meet shared our team's shared objectives. Thanks for your continued leadership and partnership!!!\n\n128#Throwing gratitude like it's confetti!!|Shoutout to this team for all that you do! I've enjoyed working with and learning from each of you over the last year! Even though most of the references Jeff and Anne make go over my head, I love learning about what was cool back in your day :)\n\n129#The best kind of AA|Hi team!   This recognition is far overdue, but I'd like to participate in World Gratitude day by re-expressing how grateful I am to be a part of this team. In the 10 months that I've been here (can you believe that!?), we've had some huge ups (WHL Atlanta) and minor downs (WHL Europe) but our group maintains a calmness and resilience that keeps me at ease and inspires me to achieve our goals week after week.   It's always fun hearing the comments our coworkers make about you guys in water-cooler conversations. You're beloved as people and professionals, and I can only hope to be lumped into that status with you! Thanks for being you.\n\n130#Fountain of Knowledge|Thank you for taking the time to answer all my questions last week while we were on site at HR Tech! Your knowledge of the industry is impressive and I'm grateful to have gotten the time with you to gain these insights in real time.\n\n131#HR Tech Teamwork|Team, Thank you for all your support in handling the partnership interest!  Between all of the partner meetings we had throughout the event, we didn't skip a beat in ensuring the prospective partners were taken care of and had a positive experience.  Thank you for the partnership on partnerships!\n\n132#Weekend dig for photos|Late Friday we learned from Sanofi that they wanted to hear our ideas for recognition and their sponsorship of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Tom, you had the brilliant idea of a co-branded gratitude bar, which led us to looking for inspiring images. Knowing our proclivity for photos, I reached out to the crack WH Live team on Saturday morning, and winning pics were found. We used the images Jill and JenP that you dug up and sent, with feedback \"you 100% met the brief in terms of the Olympic brief\". The speed and urgency that this team responded was critical in pushing us closer to becoming a client. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to act with urgency. It mattered!\n\n133#Kicking off San Diego as a Kick A** Team|Thanks to this amazing team for kicking off promotions for Workhuman Live San Diego with great enthusiasm and fresh ideas!  I'm so excited to work with each of you to make Workhuman Live San Diego our best event ever!  I appreciate you all taking the time to come together today to brainstorm our approach to the promotions journey and to kick off our plans for the launch next month.  We've got some big goals to hit - and I'm confident we can meet and surpass our objectives together.  Much appreciation for you all jumping aboard for the ride!\n\n134#Raising our Reputation!|John/Jeff - we recently were informed that an important Workhuman participant had not been paid for their services. It being three months ago, this reflected poorly on our reputation. The two of you immediately partnered together to get to the bottom of the situation and discovered that we had not been invoiced for the work they did. We quickly responded as such and protected our brand reputation. Thank you for understanding the urgency involved, identifying the factors for non-payment, and ensuring the third party was informed that we were not late in getting payment made. You both helped solve a problem and ensured our integrity remained high!\n\n135#The King Center thanks you!|Thanks, Anthony, Mark, and Jeff, for your immediate attention to The King Center's last-minute request for Spotlight registration help. They appreciated your efforts, making things extra easy for them (a special shout out to Anthony - they noted your spreadsheet came in handy!). The group loved being a part of our event and your assistance made it a streamlined experience for all.\n\n136#Spotlight Q3|As we finalize the final final final edits of the spotlight talk show, I want to recognize the collective effort of this team. From the theme development, run of show creations, script writing, speaker sourcing and selection, project management, show production, technical tests, show video edits, marketing promotion, internal viewing party activation & comms to all the areas I’m not even aware of. You’ve planned the work and worked the plan so the final show is going to be great and you should all be proud of what we’ve delivered. Now, let’s go execute it on Tuesday! Oh, we've got 7K+ people registered! Let's go.\n\n137#Spotlight Registration Forecast Staying Green|Congratulations to this team who has contributed to the success of Spotlight media campaigns. We have tracked four solid weeks of Spotlight registration consistently in the GREEN,  meaning paid media campaigns are on pace to deliver to forecast. When I think of Spotlight and this cross-functional group of program owners, PMs and creative contributors, analysts, and media professionals--I think \"well-oiled machine\". This group overcame challenges with Facebook ad approvals but now have a new video asset showing signs of greatness! We brought a new vendor to market on a guaranteed cost per registration model, HRTechCube--showcasing our commitment to innovation while leaning into proven channels. Thank you for all of your contributions!\n\n138#🙌🏼 Thank you for leading by example 🙌🏼|As of 5 pm on 8/8, just shy of 20% of our Marketing department has used Amplify to promote Spotlight. If Marketing can't market Spotlight, who can?!? Amplify helps drive registrations so, let's keep it going. Two weeks to go....Thank YOU for leading the way!\n\n139#Invaluable support!|Danielle and Jeff, thank you both for your support on the Gallup webinar analysis! Danielle, we appreciate you taking the time to provide and walk us through the meetings and opportunity data conditional upon certain time periods post event. You're a busy woman, so it means a lot that you stepped in to help support this important data analysis. But most important of all, we really appreciate you uncovering a new way of looking at data to reveal super impactful insights as it relates to an events impact on progressing prospects through the buyers journey. I feel like we’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg on this, but man is it exciting! You’re a wizard. Jeff, thank you for the time you took to review the Gallup vs Spotlight analysis. You asked some really great questions that spurred great dialogue and further data analysis to reveal helpful insights. As always, your perspective is extremely valued and I appreciate the continued opportunity to learn from you!\n\n140#Yesterday|Yesterday was a rough day. Especially for most of you who may have had flashbacks of March 2020/San Antonio. You put your heart into building an event. The decision to postpone is not an easy one even if the data tells you want you need to do.  Today you refocussed, on San Diego. Tomorrow and the next and the next - you will pour your heart into leading future Workhuman Live events. I see your dedication to producing nothing but quality events and experiences for attendees. I applaud your courage and leadership in doing what is right for the business. Thank you for communicating to your teams quickly and fielding many questions around next steps. Ready for San Diego!\n\n141#Cheers to our First Global Workhuman Partner!|Team, THANK YOU for being a part of closing our very first global partner at Workhuman: Qualtrics!  Each of you played an essential role in helping throughout this partnership journey.  Your help brought us to where we needed to be, which included: shaping the story, advising on the process and people that need to be involved, coordinating the meetings, bringing our unique value and capabilities to life through presentations, creating a memorable experience for them, providing technical guidance, and formalizing the partnership through contract.  This partnership is the first of many, and the hard work begins here.  I couldn't have done this without you.  As I arrive at my first anniversary at Workhuman, I feel blessed to work with an amazing group of individuals (who also happen to be a lot of fun!).  Thank you again! 🥂 #WorkhumanTogether\n\n142#Workhuman Live Assets|Thank you soo much for each of your efforts in helping pull together content for our Customer Webinar that is being recorded tomorrow. From PowerPoint visuals of WHLive Atlanta, Morehouse College Glee Club clip, breakout session recordings, to WHLive Europe PowerPoint promotions. We wouldn't have been able to bring the excitement from WHLive Atlanta back to life without all of your sharing of resources. I am very appreciative and can't wait to see how it lands tomorrow.\n\n143#So if you do the math....|we just bought ourselves 80 hours. I like that ROI. Thank you for investing in the planning process and each other this week. It may feel like we barely scratched the surface, but there were a lot of good discussions and new ways of thinking over our two days together. We have lots to dig into together but I'm excited! I appreciate being on this journey with this team. Thanks again!\n\n144#Great Minds Think Alike|Jeff and Stacy you must both be mind readers! In today's meeting you asked just the right questions as we move forward on our data journey. Thank you for looking for new ways to innovate!\n\n145#Amazing Listener|Jeff, I wanted to thank you for opening the door and listening to feedback I had on behalf of the team. Your commitment and dedication to working in partnership on process improvements so we can all do our best work and achieve the desired outcomes is very much valued and appreciated. Thank you!!\n\n146#Turning vision into value|From when I started 2 months ago until now, each of you has been instrumental in laying the framework for the evolution of the Executive Forum. Your leadership, advice, and trust in me in such a short time has been humbling and is deeply appreciated. As a group, thank you for your overarching leadership and strategic input throughout my tenure thus far as we begin to harness the potential of the Exec Forum and shape it into an effective tool for achieving our business goals. Individually, I have been moved by:   Jill, Jeff & Richard – your fearless leadership, patience, flexibility, and guidance along the way, when your plates are beyond full. You continue to rise to the challenge every day, and it is inspiring to watch.  Eileen, Jen R, Tom & Celia – your vision and commitment to the success of the Exec Forum as witnessed by your strategic feedback and mobilizing outreach by your respective teams   Chris & Chase – your steadfast commitment to keeping things moving forward, positioning Workhuman at the forefront of thought leadership, and capitalizing on the momentum built in Atlanta  Amy & Jen P – your strategic and creative feedback, guidance, and mentorship in the moments woven between the To Do List items  Kathryn & Abby – your innate ability to collaboratively help me turn vision to value within your respective roles while simultaneously juggling your numerous other responsibilities. I am grateful for your time and for showing up and prioritizing the Exec Forum  Though we are just getting started together, we have already made great strides - which is cause to celebrate. Thank you for all that you do. Here's to the next phase!\n\n147#Atlanta, Nailed It|Jill, Jeff –I want to thank you both for your unbelievable leadership, planning and execution of Workhuman Live Atlanta!  I have to say it felt incredible to be back, and throughout the entirety of the week I was reminded of just how far we’ve come, in no small part to your tireless dedication and collaborative teamwork to get us to this point.  From registration – “hugging” that forecast line every step of the way, to the planning, pivoting, and replanning of our space utilization, activations, and COVID safety measures and protocols in the ever fluid environment we still find ourselves in, to the seemingly flawless execution of registration (!) this was a banner event from start to finish and I’m so thankful that you were both at the helm guiding us back to in-person reality.  You have now set a new bar, but I have no doubt you’ll not only meet but exceed in the Workhuman Live events to come.  Well done and thank you again for all of your incredible work, and now onwards to Dublin and San Diego!\n\n148#It takes a village|Corina and I want to thank all of you for everything that you did for us to make the partner community have a successful and amazing experience at Workhuman Live!!  From all of our last minute questions, details for the executive forum, attendee follow ups, conference room prep, ticket questions and more... you were all so extremely helpful and supportive.  We appreciate all of you for your hard work, positive attitudes and attentiveness to make great happen for this community.  Thank you for everything and more!\n\n149#The Me for the We|Congratulations on a remarkable WHL Atlanta! Transparently, I struggled with this recognition as no amount of words would accurately summarize how I feel about each and every one of you. So, I’ll keep it short. Good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We. Your leadership throughout the planning and execution of WHL Atlanta was on show in full force and everyone was witness to its greatness. Your impact on the Workhuman business is immeasurable. Your collaboration and communication in good and tough times were timely and evident. Your impact on 1,500+ people was visibly life-changing (evident from “ugly cries to ugly laughs” and the glowing smiles throughout the event).   In the famous words of Nelson Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done!” I'm super proud of you.\n\n150#A masterclass in leadership...|I want thank you all for your impeccable leadership. Although this was my first year leading registration, badges, check-in, and returning to in-person events for the first time in 3 years, you all showed poise, trust, and compassion through what can only be described as a tumultuous process. In my 10+ years with Workhuman, this was the most confident and supported I’ve ever felt taking on a new project, especially one so publicly visible. You led me through all of the checks and balances and answered what I estimate to be north of 10,000 questions along the way. Every interaction was based on ensuring not only the success of the event but my own personal success and I cannot express how much this has meant to me. Even when tensions were high and frustration got the better of me, you remained focused on the goal and even justified the need for frustration at times. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for not only your help and guidance, but for allowing me to bring as much of myself into this event as possible. I have no doubt that we will continue to accomplish great things as a team and I look forward to taking on the next challenge, together!\n\n151#\"You good bro?\"|Outside of all the great work you did at Workhuman Live, I'd like to take a moment to thank both of you for continuously checking in on me throughout the week. Even though you were extremely busy, you took every opportunity to see how I was doing and ask whether you could help me out on the digital side of things. Your calmness, humor, and wisdom helped me settle in and made me confident that I'd complete everything I needed to for a successful event. Cheers!\n\n152#Gracious problem solving..|Folks... thanks for you super prompt support with my issue this week. I know you have so much on in the run up to WHL without having to deal with more. As much as it stings me to be \"that guy\", you were all gracious enough to not call me out on it!! Thanks so much.\n\n153#Dream Team!|Jeff and Jill - This is long overdue but no less important as you both continue to shine each day as leaders and mentors. I appreciate everything you've both done to get the ball rolling on the 2022 Executive Forum and to bring me up to speed over the past month. The ExF portion of WHL is complex and requires immense attention to detail, and you kept things moving so that I could transition into my role a seamlessly as possible. From preparing key transition and event-specific documents to making time for countless \"do you have a few minutes to talk about X?\" meetings, it means so much to be on the receiving end of your support and advocacy as I prepare to take the ExF to the next level. Thank you also for the warm welcome in Framingham this past week and for making me feel like I was part of the team from the moment I walked through the door. The influence of your combined leadership of our team is evident in all aspects of our work and group dynamic. I feel so fortunate to have landed here.\n\n154#Unleash this!|Wow - thanks for diving head first into the chilly waters of Unleash this week. You pulled the Unleash booth from under water to above water. You took meh to magnificent. It wasn't necessarily your role, but you saw it was drowning and you stepped up. I appreciate the extra team tag, all the extra design time, and dedication to quality. Cheers!\n\n155#Sharing is caring|Thank you all for taking the time to present to our Corporate sales partners in yesterday’s call. Jeff and Liz – I appreciate you both sharing updates on the Executive Forum and answering any lingering WHL questions for the team (and in short notice!). Laura – thank you for sharing all the awesome work the Demand Gen team is doing as well as an update of what programs are coming. It’s great visibility for the team to have. Thank you again!\n\n156#WHL H&S Comms Planning|Anne and Jeff -   Wanted to take a moment to recognize your continued hard work over the past few weeks (and months) around H&S comms plans for Workhuman Live! To say this year's event has found us dealing with more than a few difficult planning questions would be a massive understatement, so your collaboration and patience have been critical to keeping us all focused on the critical milestones and decision tree outcomes in this subject area.  The excitement is palpable as we get closer to the big week and much credit is due to you both for your hands-on approach and great teamwork!\n\n157#What a team!|Jeff, Anne, Kathleen, and Alex - thank you for welcoming me with open arms and taking the time to set me up for success. From the robust resources you provided to impromptu \"help please!\" meetings and slacks to generous doses of moral support, you helped me to feel accepted, supported, and appreciated from Day 1. And you somehow pulled this off while juggling all things Spotlight and Workhuman Live. WOW! I feel so lucky to be part of the team!\n\n158#Quick Pivots on Audio Ads|Lauren, Jeff, Christina, Dario, Cullen, and Richard: Thank you all for your quick work last week in turning around and approving repurposed audio creative from WHL and our narrated TV commercial! We synced up WITHIN HOURS one afternoon and were able to satisfy the network requirements for full air coverage of our media plan across American Public Media, podcasts Planet Money & NYT The Daily, and SiriusXM. I am excited to follow the dual halo impact we will have on the Workhuman brand as well as Workhuman Live. This is just the start of a more robust audio advertising journey!\n\n159#Spotlight Audience Acquisition Surge|We all saw the final scoreboard today and I am so proud of this Events & Paid Media partnership, collectively delivering the highest amount of Spotlight registrations EVER at over 6K. We pivoted hard into social as Facebook took the lead, rotating in new ads each week and esp some stellar Gary Vee video. SEM had a tremendous halo impact from 190 in Spotlight-dedicated campaigns to 787 in halo from all search. Site direct placements where expanded as much as possible to fit our tight deadlines, including some very last minute review of SHRM placements. This is a model campaign of tight weekly optimization, great creative, and ultimately breaking previous campaign records. Thank you Anne, Jeff, Dario, Sean, and Olivia for your sense of urgency to push this to the max!\n\n160#Warmest regards|Grateful for my new, most immediate, WHL family. Since joining the team you’ve all been so collaborative, helpful and patient while helping me wrap my head around this massive undertaking. I know WHL is a real village, and you have been my go-to’s for when I have questions, resourcing requests, creative support, and on and on. Truly appreciate this budding partnership.\n\n161#Exec Forum Superpowers Unite!|Team - I wanted to recognize and celebrate how exciting today's call was for this critical Sales, Customer Strategy, and Marketing growth initiative! Collectively, this group of superpowers has rallied to make great progress and develop a compelling experience and workshop plan for our Executive cultivation ambitions at Workhuman Live and beyond! Great collaboration and mash up of diversity of thought between tenured and new joiner perspectives. Onward! With gratitude, -C\n\n162#WHW Takes a Village|Thank you all for presenting today at Workhuman Wednesday. You are all doing such great work and did a fantastic job showcasing it to the company. A special shout out to our newest teammates - Corri & Kathryn. I can't wait until May where we can share it together in person.\n\n163#Helping me out!|Jeff - thank you so much for being so quick to respond when I have a Workhuman Live question. Your willingness to hop on a call right away or answer my email within minutes truly helps my process and allows me to keep going. I also appreciated you getting more of the team involved to make sure one of my questions was answered correctly. Thank you!!\n\n164#Goodbye QBR! Hello BPR!|Performance vs. Plan Weekly Meeting Team - WOW! What a quarter! We are pacing to 10,000 MQLs for Q1 vs. a forecasted goal of 8,500. On behalf of Richard and myself, we wanted to recognize this core group for your willingness to sunset old practices that no longer served our growth goals (we mean you QBR), and replace them with agile, current, and dynamic approaches to generating performance insights, actioning trends, and week on week tight management of forecasts, actuals, and course adjustments. This represents and important discipline and newly developed \"muscle\" from work that began way back in October 2021 in support of our aggressive growth goals. You invested significant cross-functional time to develop an integrated 2022 Marketing Plan. And you keenly recognized that the plan may not go as planned. So rather to wait and react, you all committed to this business performance review format and week after week dug in to the detail of what was working and what wasn't, and rapidly responded to correct or accelerate where needed. Thank you for charging at this big goal with pragmatism, confidence, and courage. Onward to Q2! With gratitude, Chris and Richard.\n\n165#March ELT Update Contributions|That's a wrap for March. Team - our weekly Marketing updates for the ELT are getting better and better. Thank you for helping to showcase all the fine work, progress and RESULTS that are happening across the department. I realize we can be a bit \"deck happy\" around here, and I'm guessing you've probably even rolled your eyes a time or two when you see me coming every week, but I couldn't do what I do without YOUR contributions. Thanks again!\n\n166#Spotlight Success|Team – what a massive win on today’s Workhuman Spotlight event!  It was an absolute thrill to watch it.  Thank you for the ingenuity and reimagination that went in to concepting and planning this new ‘talk show edition’ format, and for all of the detailed execution that went into todays broadcast.  You all nailed it!  From audience acquisition, to garnering fantastic talent for the show, to the ‘on the Streets of New York’ segment which I thought was a hit, to the carefully constructed questions and content to highlight the many opportunities and challenges facing HR today, not to mention the flawless streaming, it all came together extremely well and showcased our natural place as thought leaders and drivers of this important ‘future of work’ conversation.  Steve – you handled the job of navigating the conversations with Laurie, Steve and yes, even the unscripted Gary Vaynershuk too, like an absolute pro.  I’m excited about the demand this event will undoubtedly drive in the final weeks of Workhuman Live Atlanta registration, and equally as optimistic about our prospects for more Spotlight events and format testing in the future.   Thank you to this cross-functional team of trailblazers and innovators, and congratulations on a fantastic event!\n\n167#Interviewing Across the Aisle|Team, I just wanted to thank you all for helping me interview a wonderful candidate for my open role. The position is one that straddles the aisle between the events world and the world of marketing technology, making the interview process all the more difficult. Without hesitation, and in some cases, at the last minute, you all jumped into action and provided me with great feedback. We'll be welcoming Nicole to the team in a few short weeks and I'm positive we've found a wonderful addition to the Workhuman team. Thank you!\n\n168#Spotlighters|You are not the ones on stage. You are backstage working to make the spotlight shine on our speakers, guests, content, message, brand - all the things. Workhuman Spotlight - talk show edition is 2.5 weeks away. The recording is done. The work is far from done. I see you, working on this on top of your other work and our other events (Hello? Atlanta!). You are right on your spot doing what is needed. Thank you for your dedication, stamina, and commitment to the events, the team, the business. Cheers!\n\n169#Don't go chasin' waterfalls! ...|Ok, or in this case, please DO go chase waterfalls! Team, outstanding job to dig into Q1 performance and innovate to drive Q2 marketing growth! Through collaboration and data-driven insights you've created and lead together on a path to 18,000 marketing qualified leads in support of our growth goals. Well done! With gratitude, -C\n\n170#In the Spotlight|Team, Wow! The Spotlight shoot today was amazing. As a team, we spoke a lot about due diligence and dotting our “i’s” and crossing out “T” and today you proved that we did exactly that. We captured incredible content from well prepared speakers alongside a world class crew. It’s our collective effort that will allow this content and our message to spread across the world! Thank you for dedication, focus on quality, and commitment to getting us to this point. Proud moment. #progress. Thank you\n\n171#Preparation = Progress|Team, thank you for preparing the WHL presentation for my meeting today with Eric. It’s the preparation, the educational / context setting calls/texts/slacks that give me the confidence to represent the vision (with the details). We’re building momentum and these are critical updates for the business and how we progress forward. Thank you\n\n172#Spotlighting this Spotlight Team|The unsung heros of Workhuman Spotlight!  This team moves mountains to get it done!  Owen and Liu - such respect for the creative you both produce, even under aggressive deadlines.  Dianne, you are always on top of all the things and keeping us moving.  Z and Jeff, your assistance to review, pushing for approvals and overall guidance are instrumental.  Thank you all !!\n\n173#WHL ELT Update|Jeff and Jill, I’m really proud of how you prepared and communicated the WHL operational and registration update to the ELT. Internal custumers are critical in the success journey and these opportunties provide us an environment to learn and gather feedback. Congratulations on a successful update and for absorbing the feedback (which we’ll action). Well done!\n\n174#Teamwork makes the dream work|Team, thank you for being great role models and taking time to teach me and talk through tasks. Reflecting on ~6 months at Workhuman and everything the team has been doing to push forward to Workhuman Live. I appreciate all of your advice and help throughout my time here! Let’s keep going 😊\n\n175#Thank you in a hard time|Truly, thank you for the kind messages about Shadow yesterday and today. If you can believe it, this will be the first major passing in my life, and I'm not yet sure how I'm going to handle it, but hearing your stories and affirmations have put me at ease. I'm fortunate to be a part of a team that respects not only the quality of their work, but are ultimately kind-hearted people :)\n\n176#The Survey Says...|I wanted to highlight how great it is to work with this group. The Workhumanlive survey went from idea, to concept, to live survey in record time! Not only did we get the survey out, but the responses collected have been invaluable to learning how to pivot and target our strengths. Your collective willingness to take in the information and act on it quickly is just one cog in your wheel of success. Kudos to all of you and thank you for being such good partners.\n\n177#WHL Resilience|Team, planning an in-person event in our current global environment is very challenging. Today, you presented a solid plan to Eric with a clear action plan to move our WHL planning forward. Thank you for staying flexible and focused and for tackling uncertain times with productive mitigation plans and net new ways of working with scenario plans. You’re working outside of your comfort zone, building trust internally, and managing communication exceptionally well. Be confident we’ll find a solution and we’re on track to producing the best WHL ever.\n\n178#Better together|This team continues to amaze me. No matter what the challenge or the timeframe, you are all there, every damn time, bringing your absolute best. In the past 2 days we have had 4 meeting to help solve some recent challenges and you all showed up with your best ideas, creativity, snarky senses of humor, challenging one another, and identifying pitfalls - all with the utmost respect for the business and one another. You exemplify the culture we strive to create.\n\n179#Reimagination Engineers|The world is unprecedented and this team was challenged to reimagine options for Workhuman Live to ensure that we are able to deliver the experience, content and feelings of our flagship event to meet the needs of the unknown.  Over the course of two days, this group dropped everything to strategize the best options to move ahead.  I think the team came up with truly thoughtful ideas.  No matter how it takes shape, I'm confident our event bring down the house.  So proud to work with this group of humans.\n\n180#Leadership|Jeff - thank you for you leadership. That is all.  But really... thank you for your calm, strategic approach to managing the work and leading your team. You think before speaking, act instead of react, and set a fine example of emotional intelligence. I am grateful to be able to work with you and support your team. Cheers!\n\n181#Moving with the wind|Thank you all for taking a crazy amount of information and feedback, distilling it, moving the parts around, keeping everyone in the loop all the while doing the day to day stuff. It is an honor to work with people of excellence which each of you truly brings to this team.\n\n182#Communication makes the world go round|What a perfect example of team collaboration! Even though each of us sit on different teams, report to different folks and even physically sit somewhere else ......we spoke to each other! I witnessed an amazing email chain where Jeff made sure Cara was in the know and Abby confirmed all were aware and it made my heart sing. Thank you humans for showing how teamwork really makes the Dream work and over communication in hybrid times is crucial! #rolemodels\n\n183#Steering the Ship|Jeff, you see and recognize all the team members supporting Workhuman Live.  Well, you should know that we see you right back.  Over the past couple weeks, you've gathered the team together multiple times to strategize, plan and begin to execute a pivot on WHL promotions to get us where we need to be.  Every meeting is thoughtful, respectful on the work that has been done, and action oriented take us to the next level.  Every day I am grateful to be a part of this Workhuman Live crew - and you are the captain of that ship.  Thank you!\n\n184#Feels longer than 3 months (in the best way)|Jeff and Anne,  I’ve been reflecting on my first 90 days with Workhuman and I can’t think you both enough for the support and guidance throughout my 3 months! It’s such an exciting time between Spotlight and preparation for Workhuman Live- but there is so much going on. You are both great teachers and always willing to help when I’m lost. I appreciate you bringing a positive and encouraging work atmosphere each day.  I feel like I’m beginning to get a handle on what is going on here and am excited to continue to help our audience acquisition team where I can.   So, cheers to you both for bringing me onto this team, showing me the ropes, and becoming my new pals! 😊\n\n185#Leading by Example|Jeff - Walking into the office and seeing you lead a 3 hour creative workshop for WHL with 20+ peers was heartwarming and energizing. You created the agenda, managed the workshop breakout sessions, led by example, and addressed the issues head on.   Thank you for bringing the team together and for your phenomenal leadership this week!\n\n186#Thank you for the warm welcome :)|Hey team,   I'd like to cap off my 2nd week at Workhuman by thanking you for being great teammates. You've welcomed me into your processes, patiently answered my questions, and earnestly listened to my opinions. I never thought I could be so comfortable while also drinking from a firehose!  I'm grateful to be working with such a bright, friendly, and hard working group, and I look forward to gaining your trust and delivering epic event experiences together.\n\n187#Events is sometimes like|a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Popcorn, toast, and jellybeans. Who needs turkey?! You contribute seemingly simple yet magnificent resourcefulness and problem solving capabilities to the team. And of course what really matters is the people. Thank you to the humans who plan, build, review, deploy, monitor, and report on all the work. I am grateful to be able to work with you. Cheers!\n\n188#Scenario Planning Sesh #1 was what I'd call a Win|My head is spinning from all the inspired thinking in today's planning meeting. Thank you for sharing your Plans on a Page <or is it 'Plan on a Pages?!'> with the broader team. Thank you for deep diving into some of our Marketing priorities to identify integration points, gaps, opportunities for testing, and more. It was awesome to see different people gather to collaborate cross-functionally and spend time thinking about the \"what if sh....scenarios.\" And lastly, thank you for being good sports about the ice breakers questions. From Buzz Lightyear to time machine travel, childhood crushes  and early retirement dreams, I learned a lot of new things about each of you today!  And yet, I am sure you all agree that it felt like we barely scratched the surface in our three hours today. Not to worry! This is the starting point and I have a good feeling that this was just the first of many Scenario Planning sessions to come. So strap in and look forward to next steps AND the next invite. I am excited to work together to ensure we are set up to deliver business results, feel proud of our work, and have some fun along the way.\n\n189#Hiring Success!|Jeff - long overdue but want to recognize you for your partnership in our search for a Digital Event Experience Manager.  You took the time to ensure I understood the needs of the team and what success would look like in the role.  You provided super detailed feedback on each candidate and always took the time to touch base to discuss my findings.  So glad we found such a great candidate in Alex - thank you for your partnership!\n\n190#What an amazing team!|A huge shout out to Jill, Jen, Mark, Jeff & Melissa who made this week’s Atlanta site visit with Sparks a true experience! While this may have felt like “old hat” for many of you, this was a first for me and I was blown away by the level of expertise, thoughtfulness, partnership, collaboration, comradery and energy that every human brought into the process. It made the trip so unique, successful, and of course fun! Each of you brought a lens and level of detail that was critical to the mission. And on top of everything else, you made me feel like part of the team, no matter what my question, observation, or idea was. THANK YOU!!! I can’t wait to continue to play my small role in the evolution of WHL 2022. Please know how much I appreciate each of your contributions. YOU all are what make this event so phenomenal!\n\n191#The goal is progress, not perfection!|“First steps are always the hardest but until they are taken the notion of progress remains just a notion and not an achievement” — Through a time of transition, new planning processes and forecasts, and current executional needs this team has been exceptional. You’ve come together, forced needed changes, asked the right questions, and most importantly you’ve done it as a team. Thank you for leading by example, overcoming the daily challenges, and for accepting new perspectives and approaches.   You are building our game plans now so we can all enter the stadium with confidence together next year.   Remember, The goal is progress, not perfection\n\n192#Can you look at this file, ok how about this one..|Jeff, I'm scared to look at how many questions I have asked you in the past couple of weeks. Thanks for consistently giving me feedback, helping me get on the same page, and helping me get working files over to Adapt with the quickness. Your respect for urgency does not go unseen.\n\n193#The A Team|A huge shout out to this team for consistently being the foundation to the cross-functional group that produces the company's most coveted event (and then some). Whether it's putting in the work upfront with the overarching strategy or the oh-so-many details to follow, it's truly remarkable that less than 10 people keep it all afloat and moving downstream. It's been an honor to be in the trenches with you and I thank you for always supporting and teaching me along the way. I can't wait to see all that you'll accomplish next year but this is an appreciation post for all that you've done and overcome thus far. Sincerely, your biggest cheerleader.\n\n194#Captains of the Events Ship|Jill and Jeff - thank you for steering the (enormous) ships of executing the digital Spotlight event at the same time as launching the registration and promotion of Workhuman Live Atlanta.  One event alone is a significant task, but you were leading the execution of both at the same time.  Thank you for your leadership and direction so the team could execute on our objectives.  Could not be more proud to work on a team with you leading the way.\n\n195#And thats a wrap!|Thank you for bringing your brilliance, remarkable talents, expertise, creativity, innovative thinking, and skills to drive the successful execution of the Spotlight broadcast and WHLive registration launch.  The work for these projects starts months in advance and continues for weeks after we go live. Over the last several months, there were endless moments of comradery, collaboration, and a continuous drive to raise the bar.    The road was challenging, but despite the obstacles, YOU DID IT!  You delivered a fabulous production and flawless launch.   Your passion is contagious. Congratulations and celebrate the moment!!\n\n196#WordPress Wonder|Jeff & Kathleen, thank you for helping to garner agency support for the speaker asset uploads. Since it's been over a year since I've done any type of basic coding or navigation in WordPress you ensured others were on board to help get the necessary pieces uploaded to the WHL 2022 website. I appreciate you jumping in to support this area.\n\n197#Spotlight on Website|Jeff and Biz, Congratulations on planning, selecting a vendor, working with them, and together delivering great success!  From everything I heard and we discussed, the work with Adapt was a home run, and the website was there every step of the way.  Now we move on to WH Live Atlanta.  ore great success ahead of you!  Congratulations!\n\n198#The BEAST!|Team! thank you so much for your hard work and collaboration on the WH Spotlight post event enablement deck for the CSMs. We found the deck we did in May worked out terrific; so added a few new features for the fall:). 'The beast' as we lovingly call it; is such a great tool and one stop shop for our busy team to find the bits they need in a flash. Thank you for the time spent building, brainstorming and sharing with our team. Appreciate the partnership!\n\n199#\"IRL practice\" for a \"Virtual success\"|Team - Outstanding to see all of you come together today to conduct final prep and plan for our Oct 6th Spotlight Broadcast. It is clear you all are laser focused on a great experience for our customers. Keep up the great work! With gratitude, -C\n\n200#Beautiful compromise|Yesterday we had a bit of a scramble with competing priorities. Thank you all for coming to the table to offer solutions. Everyone compromised a little, shifted a little, and we landed in a better place. This is how teamwork gets it done! I'm grateful to work with all of you. Cheers.\n\n201#Spotlight On YOU!|I am terribly behind in recognizing all the incredible work this team has been doing to keep the Spotlight promotions strong.  We've made multiple optimizations to the website, launched 6 weeks of solid promotions and we're still going.  This week was a stellar week for registrations thanks to you.  Thank you all for your dedication, hard work and positive attitudes.  We're almost there!\n\n202#Presenting ... Workhuman Spotlight|Team - Thank you for your important contributions to our upcoming Progress Meeting discussion on Workhuman Spotlight. Your teamwork in creating a crisp and succinct overview of strategy, run of show, promotions, and tech plans is appreciated. I'm excited about the plan we have to share, and look forward to co-presenting with Mark and Jen next week. With gratitude, -C\n\n203#And the Academy Award goes to...|Team - what a great surprise to see Matt talking to the world about why they should register for Spotlight in what I am sure will be the beginning of many starring roles. From Owen's masterful abstract to Chris C's camera work to Matt's acting (I will be your agent!) to Jeff and Ann always looking for innovate ways to get butts in <virtual> seats, there is so much innovation goodness to celebrate. Thank you for putting your heads together to humanize our brand in a creative and very enjoyable way.  This would be my vote for best movie of the year.\n\n204#Teamwork makes the dream work!|A sincere note of thanks to each of you for stepping up to cover all the things while I was on vacation.  As it turns out, you not only had to cover for me, but it was an even busier week with multiple Spotlight optimizations that became a top priority.  Not to worry, you had it covered.  I was able to enjoy a magical 9 days with the family thanks to you.\n\n205#Interview squad|A big thank you to each of you for your time, focus and feedback on candidates for the Marketing Program Manager role. During an extremely busy period for us all, you each were willing to take time out of your busy schedules to interview candidates to ensure we found the right fit for our team. I sincerely appreciate your focus and dedication, as well as the conversations many of us had around what we were looking for in potential candidates. You all provided very thoughtful feedback which led us to finding and hiring a wonderful candidate. Julia has accepted our offer and will be joining Workhuman on September 27th. Our team couldn’t be more thrilled!\n\n206#Spotlight on Malcolm|Malcolm Gladwell is in market for Spotlight!  Huge shout out to this team for pivoting and moving the Malcolm campaign up a week and launching our keynote speaker!  Since the promos began on Wednesday, we've added 1,139 new registrations for the event.  We've got some momentum - thanks to each of you!\n\n207#Revving up registration|Jon, Jeff - Awesome job driving enhancements in the Spotlight registration and promotions approach. Your use of UI data to refine, streamline and quicken the path to registration and your creativity around on site promotions to leverage our collective site traffic will surely help us achieve our goals for Spotlight. Thank you for your teamwork and sense of urgency demonstrated. -C\n\n208#Register Now!|Team - When we were presented with a challenge regarding registration numbers you quickly jumped in with thoughtful planning & creative solutions to solve the task at hand. Your dedication is amazing & the way you support each other is inspiring. Proud to be working with each of you!\n\n209#Spreading the Word|Our friend Priya is back! Thank you for helping launch the first speaker for Workhuman Spotlight.  For your time, dedication, and commitment to quality. On to weeks 3, and 4, and 5....\n\n210#The Final Countdown|The Band was Europe and the song was “It’s the Final Countdown.”  Here’s to the Band that pulled the Spotlight broadcast launch together. Following months of preparations, the official launch hit the streets on Wednesday and the registrations are rolling in. Congratulations to all of you for the effort, creativity, and teamwork.  T-48 and counting!\n\n211#Exceptional Brief Writing|Jeff- You have delivered an exceptionally written media brief for our agency and paid media team! It went into depth in each section where information was requested, AND you took it much further with special considerations (spend flighting, covid travel considerations, etc.). The surrounding material was comprehensive--\"new WH employee style onboarding\" with the WHL hype video & presentation, recap from Nashville 2019, and recap from WHLO Spring 2020. In the Zoom windows I saw smiles and head nods as our agency partners were able to absorb the energy and importance of this event. You left us all begging for free passes. ;) Seriously, you uniquely energized us all to plan for this event!\n\n212#On-boarding Rockstars|Jeff and Anne, thank you both so much for all your help these past few weeks getting me adjusted to our team and Workhuman! You have been extremely patient and helpful while also teaching me how to get things done efficiently.  Jeff, thank you for answering all my most random questions and being able to get me in touch with the right people.   Anne, thank you for letting me be your shadow and for explaining all situations to create a more holistic view for me of what is going on.   I’m so excited to see what our team can do when I’m fully up and running and able to dive into helping! I appreciate you both 😊\n\n213#August Customer Marketing Meet (and Exceed) Up!|Team - Thank you for exceptional presentations today during our meet up! The spotlight on our humans and our shared successes has quickly become a fan favorite. I appreciate you each carving time out to share thoughtful and well constructed views into program previews, successes, and learnings. Really well done! With gratitude, -C\n\n214#Respect for Quality QBRs!|With the pace of business and everything on our plates, it's easy to want to just keep your head down and march forward...However, it's important to stop, look back and evaluate the past. With the right mindset, the past offers lessons that can influence the future - helping us work smarter, make better marketing investment, strengthen our process, refine our messaging/creative and ultimately shape what we will test and optimize next. We wrap the 2Q'QBR up on Monday and I wanted to say THANK YOU to each of you for the time and effort you put into documenting and sharing key insights from your respective areas of marketing expertise. QBRs are an important part of the planning cycle and I am grateful for your commitment to them.\n\n215#Together is Better|Thank you all for being open and sharing your stories during our team meeting. We have a great group of individuals, with tremendous talent and respect for one another. I personally loved learning more about each of you, your journeys, and what matters most in your life and career. You are all amazing people, and I am thrilled to have the chance to work with each one of you. P.S. Only you will know why I selected this photo for the award!!!\n\n216#Calling all Speakers – It’s Live!|Thank you all for your contribution to the Call for Speakers webpage. We’ve evolved this from a way to collect submissions for our annual event to support all of our engagements that have the opportunity to include external voices – live events, digital broadcasts, webinars, the LinkedIn Live series, and more. It’ll also now lives on the corporate website year-round opposed to an event site for only 3-months. We get thousands of submissions each year and now those applicants can easily click over to learn more about our products and customers on Workhuman.com. This was a labor of love that included project management, web design, form and email creation, web updates, and additional brainstorming amongst others. I appreciate this cross-functional team of experts.\n\n217#How many MQLs? By when?!|Team - Thank you for your collaborative and thorough work to develop a 2H marketing leads plan that fully leverages our marketing investments to maximize growth in our business and market opportunity potential for our sales teams in the second half of the year. Terrific work to look at this both from a top down and ground up perspective. We have a solid plan and clear expectations and accountabilities to manage ourselves to in 2H. Well done and with gratitude! -C\n\n218#Presentation Perfecto!|Team - thank you for a terrific meet up yesterday - you all shared great insights, learnings, and actionable takeaways that can be applied broadly across the marketing and sales organizations to help drive our growth! Great questions, discussion, and engagement. Well done. With gratitude, -C\n\n219#WorkhumanLive 2022 - We're on our way!|\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\" - thank you for making the first step in our 2022 journey start on the right foot. We have a comprehensive and succinct pre-read and strategic framework to take with us into our leader stakeholder alignment session this week. Great teamwork to get it there, and I'm optimistic and grateful for what's to come. With gratitude, -C\n\n220#Working Human Champions Unite!|I wanted to express my gratitude to this fine team of colleagues who have come together to share ideas, express concerns and TAKE ACTION to help shape the human experience and culture for our Marketing team. Your commitment goes way back to last fall when we formed the original Pulse Survey Groups but we reinvented ourselves about a month ago and decided there is strength in numbers. When you share a common goal and vision, it might make sense to join forces. And, wow...were we spot on. I love the collaboration and get giddy when hearing and seeing the larger group feed off each other's ideas. This group championed the DiSC workshop as our first official all hands L&D opportunity. This group helped reimagine the town hall as a platform to showcase the strong work and diverse voices across all of Marketing. This group is thinking ahead to what the next phase of work, when we step away from our Zoom calls and return to the office in some form or fashion, means for our newest marketers and everyone else that survived the last year+! This group is thoughtfully pulling together strategies to help foster the human connections that will inevitably make our team stronger and our work even better. It's a side hustle when we are all hustled out most days, but it matters and I genuinely appreciate your investment. We've only scratched the surface, but after receiving positive feedback on yesterday's town hall and coming off of a lively planning call with many of you earlier today regarding our next couple of initiatives, I am feeling optimistic about the journey we've chosen to take together. #btpftp THANK YOU for your commitment to me, to each other, to all of Marketing, and to working human!\n\n221#Valuing and Actioning Feedback!|Anne and Jeff - thank you so very much for your hard work consolidating and sharing out feedback from our WHLO enablement discussions. This event is such a beast and touches nearly each group within the company - you both have been terrific in understanding the needs and how those may need to differ across teams. I am so excited by the deck for the Fall event you pulled together. Getting these bits sorted and outlined well in advance will help us ensure the teams have been heard and we can support them in a more scalable way. Thank you for driving this effort!\n\n222#Grace and respect|Anne and Jeff, thank you for the moment of grace you shared with me on Friday. I was deep into some data work when you reached out for an update on an analysis. When I shared that it would be tricky for me to step away, you both met me with grace and patience. Balancing respect for urgency and respect for all of the type of work that needs to get done. Thank you for the boost of momentum that came from your kindness.\n\n223#WHLO Retro|Thank you for completing the WHLO survey within the allotted timeframe. Your feedback is important to help drive improvements in how we work on future events. I appreciate your time and input. Your voice has been heard. Cheers!\n\n224#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n225#Human Multitaskers!|Anne and Jeff - is human multitasking a thing? If so, you both could teach an epic masterclass on the topic!!!! I greatly appreciate your support over the last few months with WHLO. Answering questions, tracking down unknown details, providing critical updates on content and credits and most of all, being an additional voice for the customer. Greatly appreciate all you have done for the team to help keep us on track with the post event (and pre event!) plans. Cheers to you both!!!!!\n\n226#Show time email|You were in the audience watching Workhuman Live Online. You were Slacked about an urgent email request. You were pulled out of your seat and back to your desk (pretending that these places are not all the same right now ;-). Thank you for responding to the call, for waiting on standby after hours and then jumping back into action the next day for revisions to get us to final and out the door. Tremendous dedication, patience, and teamwork. Cheers!\n\n227#Never say Last|Team - this recognition is for your efforts on the 'Last Chance' campaign to entice people to join Workhuman Live Online. The work came at the end of many weeks of exerted effort and non-stop promotions across all possible channels. Thank you for giving this last reminder communication as much attention as the first one from months ago. I applaud your dedication. Cheers!\n\n228#Fastest keynote|Team, We just launched the second keynote speaker for Workhuman Live Online. You did it in record time. From negotiating contracts, making quick decisions, developing copy and creative, speedy approvals, building, trafficking, launching, coordinating schedules. We even recorded Common's session before we promoted him. That's a first! Common and Zain were prepped for a relevant conversation to close the event and drive home our messaging. Then on to editing. Oh my, so much editing to filter out the best of all the words. It takes a dedicated team of individuals with unique skills to include a keynote in an event. Thank you for your commitment to Workhuman Live. I recognize all the work you do behind the scenes to make it seem... common.\n\n229#FOMO - Oh no!|No fear of missing out with this crew!  Team, you rallied to execute our second Workhuman Live Online campaign this week - and kicked off the final push for registrations like masters.  We have a lot going on in this final week, and everyone stepped up to make sure we hit our go live date for FOMO - and we're seeing the needle move because of it.  Thank you for your teamwork and dedication to making this event a success.\n\n230#The Time Zone Wizards|Jeff and Alex, thank you both for individually helping me navigate the labyrinth that is the British and European time zones. GMT, BST, CET, IST…huh? If this was a game show, you were definitely my two “call a friend” cards. It would have been quite the flounder to set up our upcoming webinars at the wrong time, or promote them incorrectly. So thank you for your assistance – I learned some new things today!\n\n231#WHLOFOMO|Thank you to this team for helping us get the word out internally for WHLO registration, agenda building, and social sharing. Anne, I appreciate you pivoting and pushing out the registration comms, so we could go out with one message. Holly, thank you for jumping in to edit copy and provide the social/amplify details we needed. Chris and Jeff, thank you for pulling together the details for Eric's check-in, and for getting me the latest and greatest numbers in time to be included in the session. Colleen, thank you for your keen eye, respect for quality (and comms etiquette), and ensuring we're consistent in our language. Great teamwork!\n\n232#Eyes on the prize|Jeff, we have a lot going on with just a few weeks left before Workhuman Live.  Every day you bring focus, determination, and positivity to our team.  Even with multiple deliverables and imminent deadlines, and non work related pressures, you are a rock.  Thanks for all you do, and the leadership you bring to the events team.\n\n233#A data analysts dream!|Jeff and Anne, as we continue to prepare for WHLO, I'm excited to keep working with you all to learn and grow through your curious questions and data driven decision making. When the digital analytics team came to you and noted a drop off happening during a key portion of registration, you took in the data and made quick critical decisions to improve that experience. Two and a half weeks out to the event we're seeing the impact of the improved customer experience in higher conversions within the form fill process. Thank you for noticing the opportunity and implementing data driven decisions. And for continuing to ask hard questions. I'm looking forward to all the impact WHLO will have this season. Go team!\n\n234#Adam Grant In Market!!|What a week for this team.  Not only one WHLO promotional announcement but two.  We kicked it up about 1,000 notches to get Adam Grant negotiated, contracted, copy written, designs done, approvals all around, and in market.  Within just a few days.  This team continues to perform at an amazing level.  Every. Single. Day.  It was a chaotic, frenzied, and yes - sometimes frustrating week.  But everyone pulled together to execute.  Thanks to everyone for the teamwork, urgency and top quality work.\n\n235#Speakers and More Speakers|Almost feels like an in-person event to have this many speakers! Landing so many speakers is a huge achievement in a compressed digital event timeframe. Kudos. A second speaker announcement was not in the plan. But how could we not shout out about more great names and companies? Game. Changers. Even with an extra twist to get a couple of external approvals you launched the assets without delay. Thank you for rolling with the changes and still bringing your best to the work. It is your determination and dedication that is driving registrations. Cheers to you all!\n\n236#Master Jugglers!|Anne and Jeff, is there such thing as a master juggler?! If there is, you both ARE IT. You masterfully juggle all the things with the Live promo schedule. You communicate cross functionally, collaborate on thoughtful solutions - all while being the most kind and patient humans around. We are so lucky to have you both digging in and supporting Live. Awesome partnership all around!\n\n237#Same day help|Last week Amy needed a PPT to try to land a speaker for Workhuman Live. She put out the call. You answered with assets to leverage, suggestions on content, and a quick polish to get it out the door. Thanks, team!\n\n238#Power humans|Team, it is a bit overdue, but I wanted to thank each of you for how much effort has gone into the balancing of two agencies along with all the regular work of creating another Workhuman Live digital event. This event is so much more ambitious than our previous broadcasts, there are so many moving parts, and so many things we don't have control over. You have kept everyone in the loop, communicating internally and externally, made fast decisions, pivots, and pulled the teams together to brainstorm the best ways to meet the goals. I cannot thank you enough for the hard work, the patience, but mostly the teamwork–it takes a village (and then some!)\n\n239#Live site is Live!|This team! Tremendous accomplishment today in launching WorkhumanLive.com including a new registration platform. We had multiple new vendors, which is a huge lift to get set up and on board. We had few days to build and test. You all worked together, bringing your individual expertise to the work and determination to meet an aggressive launch date. I saw many of you patting your head while rubbing your belly (so to speak). Your dedication and hard work paid off. Humans are registering. Every day counts. I am thankful for this team in getting to Day 1!\n\n240#It's Raining... Focus|We were given a deadline from a vendor on Friday morning. We received specs for the work late Friday. The deadline was the following Monday. I believe this is the shortest timeline I've seen in the past 5 years. Because we are working with a second vendor, there was a lot of concern (at least on my part!) in creating assets in less than 8 business hours. Thank you for supporting each other over the weekend, knowing this was a critical deadline, being responsive in reviewing WIP, sending pieces of information, participating in the review/progress meeting, and maintaining... Focus. I'm so impressed (and hope we never have to turn assets around that quickly again). Cheers to you, team!\n\n241#When the rubber meets the road - for an event|It takes a lot of tires. The event dates changed. Within minutes action was taken. Within hours - Vendors were contacted. Logos were created. Assets for marketing and sales enablement were updated and shared. Things were paused. Plans for additional work were developed. Within days - Web pages were updated, email was written, built, and launched, comms were shared, calendars were updated, campaigns were revisited and adjusted. It was a lot of effort by a lot of expert and dedicated humans. Thank you!\n\n242#Raising Live and in life|Jill and Jeff,  Raising Workhuman Live - I've referred to you as the co-parents of Workhuman Live in the past. Jill, you are the Producer who builds the event. Jeff, you bring the people to it. You bring complimentary skills and styles that make 'raising' each event possible. In the past year there have been many changes: event formats, leadership, timelines, vendors, dates. The list is long. You remain the constant. The people the team turns to and relies on for stability, advice, and support. Thank you.  Raising teens - while all that is happening, you are also raising teens. The world is driving in the fog right now, no one knowing what the future looks like. Teens are driving without fog lights. They don't have the life experience to understand right now is temporary, and how to see through the fog. Yet as they end their high school journey, teens are expected to make big life decisions. Parenting through this is hard, and heavy, and happens mostly off-screen. I see you.  The combination is a one-two punch some days. I see you managing it and holding it all together. I see you moving from Live to life and back again. I recognize you, and support you, and appreciate that you show up - day after day after day. Keep being awesome.\n\n243#Creative discussion partners!|Team, thank you for your participation, creative discussion and investment in our process of defining Marketing KPIs as we envision our plan for development. I was inspired and motivated by your expertise and feedback during our session yesterday. This has truly been a team effort held up by all humans involved! I'm excited to see where our imagination and determination take marketing analytics.\n\n244#Group hug to team huddle|Jeff, At the beginning of the week we learned of a change to leadership for the events team.  You quickly reached out to the team with words of support, encouragement, and you expressed your confidence in the team. One collective deep breath because that's all there was time for. Then everyone jumped into action to regroup, reassess, rejigger... all the event things. At the end of the week you sent a note to acknowledge all the progress the team had made. We did not skip a beat. Thank you stepping in and leading with your mindful, empathetic approach. And as someone who doesn't officially report into the events team, I especially appreciated being included in your outreach. Thank you for your leadership.\n\n245#Thoughtful Leadership|Jeff - this recognition has been on my mind for a while, but poignant and important this week for sure.  Thank you for always being a source of guidance, open and honest communication and enabling me to focus on the work that needs to get done.  Many times over the last few months, you've helped me prioritize and stay on task by dedicating time to our daily check ins.  And when unexpected things come up that impact the events group overall, you're the first to reach out and bring the team together to connect, which equips us to move forward.  It's part of who you are and what makes you a great leader.  Lucky to be on your team.\n\n246#'It takes a village' - what a welcome!|Team - thank you for your time and flexibility in welcoming our new humans into the North America team! You have all been incredible at connecting your strategy with the roles of our new humans, creating that link for them to better understand how they can contribute and develop within Workhuman.   I am so grateful for the time, the only thing Warren Buffet said he could not buy more of, it is well spent in creating an amazing first impression on our new hires, even in a virtual environment.   Thank you!\n\n247#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n248#\"Experience\" Experts Unite|Wanted to give a shout out to this team for the thoughtful approach, care and attention you put into creating the WH Live session for our integrated marketing planning \"offsite\" later this afternoon. Would have been easy to default to a never-ending PPT deck and 45 minutes of a traditional presentation format, but you took to heart specific feedback and created what I am sure will be an engaging experience for all. Looking forward to it. THANK YOU!\n\n249#Team data|Thank you for spending time this week outside of your current workload to gather historical data to help inform decisions for our future work. I appreciate your time and dedication. Cheers!\n\n250#New Year Goals|Thank you all for providing your feedback on the speakers bureau as we closed out 2020. This recognition is long overdue (holiday brain) but it was extremely helpful to hear your goals for the new year to better understand how the bureau can support upcoming projects with speaking engagements. Whether you walked us through a planning deck, sent notes via email, or participated in an open dialogue - it all helped to shape our ‘21 planning efforts.\n\n251#Putting in the work|Team - on behalf of Patti and myself, we wanted to say, \"Thank you\" and recognize the teamwork, collaboration, and effort you've collectively put in to moving our Pulse Survey action plans forward from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Together, we've made great quarter over quarter progress due to your efforts. This is an \"above and beyond\" initiative you've stepped up to lead. In doing so, you are each playing a leadership role for your marketing colleagues and peers - and - making a meaningful contribution to Patti, Tyler, and myself in building an amazing employee experience. This type of work is not the kind you can do \"every so often\" or \"sometimes\" and expect to achieve progress. It takes ongoing focus, a solutions-based outlook, courage and candor to build and sustain a great employee experience. Thank you for putting in the work - we look forward to continued advancements as we turn the page to 2021! With gratitude, -C\n\n252#But you \"made it work\" in 2020!|Team - Tim Gunn was right! We had very ambitious plans for 2020! And then they all changed to a \"different set\" of \"very ambitious\" endeavors and goals ... and you thrived, moved the organization forward to growth, and made sure businesses knew what's next, started now! Thank you for major contributions like: Implementing a data-driven approach to lead generation and pipeline growth resulting in significant growth of MQLs to 10,000!; Launching our first-ever TV and OTT ads; Helping executives unlock grand gestures of gratitude through Team Awards; Developing and delivering two WHLs (albeit in very different ways than originally planned); And helping grow our Employee Experience to rank on the Great Places to Work in 2020! Way to rock it out in 2020, and show 2021 a preview of what a human centered, impact driven approach looks like. Thank you for a terrific year of results, teamwork, support of our stakeholder partners, and resiliency through and through. With gratitude, -C\n\n253#Thank you for the leadership|Jeff, Thank you for jumping in during the Feels Values team presentation yesterday. Mark did a fine job presenting our content, but needed an assist in the follow up discussion and you were right there for the team. Much appreciated!\n\n254#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n255#Taking the pulse by the horns|What? Recognition for a thing we haven't finished yet? Is that even...legal?  I wanted to take this moment to say how much I appreciate the openness, positivity, and collaboration of this pulse survey action group extraordinaire. Taking on tough topics when things are \"not entirely bad\" isn't easy. Doing so with a constructive, collaborative spirit and open ears is even harder. Not descending into a whinge-fest may be hardest of all. But I've been heartened and impressed with how dedicated y'all have been to this group and its mission.   It is always, always easier to assume something is someone else's problem. Here's to y'all making it yours.\n\n256#Lights, Camera, Action Groups!|Team - Z and I want to thank you all for your work getting the Pulse Survey Action Groups kicked off. Your ideas we so thoughtful and well crafted for the short window we gave you. We are beyond impressed! As Chris said, this is hugely important work and it is ongoing. We are excited to continue our partnership with you as we build and develop out these programs! We are grateful for you all!\n\n257#Great teammate|Jeff, A big thank you for your help with the Unleash program! When I reached out to ask if you'd have time and be willing to drive this forward, you offered your support without hesitation. I'm grateful to have you as a supportive teammate. Thank you!\n\n258#Consistent Collaboration|Jeff - this is long overdue, but I want to recognize your consistent guidance and collaboration with all the tasks leading up to Workhuman Live Online and post event campaigns.  Every single day we had a check in to discuss top priorities, status of projects, address concerns and sometimes vent a little.  :-). Our meetings kept me motivated and allowed us to be connected, even though we're still remote.  i'm truly grateful to e on your team and look forward to jumping in on the next big thing!\n\n259#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n260#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n261#Speed and Delegation|Jeff, thank you so much for helping me put together the playbook post WHLO! Even after putting on a successful event, your work wasn't done. You came in and delegated tasks so well and were instrumental in getting this playbook out on Friday afternoon. I couldn't have done it without your help, thank you fellow Jeff!\n\n262#Thinking about our Customers!|Jeff and Anne, I appreciate all of the support you have provided the existing customer team with WH Live Online promotions (and follow up!). You both seek to understand the different audiences, are receptive to feedback and have done an awesome job keeping the team in the loop on the many, many moving parts! I'm super excited to see the bits we put in place move the needle on the customer numbers and can't wait to see how the follow up goes. Three cheers to you both!\n\n263#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n264#Versions 1, 2, and 3|Thanks to this team for being able to pivot quickly. I can imagine how difficult it is to get assets out the door with so many eyes on it for review and approvals. I appreciate everyone huddling together early this morning (thanks to Dianne for making it happen) to come up with a game plan. Plus with our talented designers every version just gets better and better!\n\n265#Total Resilience Virtual|This is over due but I wanted to thank each of you for jumping in to support the Total Resilience show when it went from a live event (Total Rewards) to a virtual one.  This was the first one that we did when the world shut down.  There were a lot of unknowns, due dates that moved constantly and with all the people that had pieces of it to get off the ground.  Your weekly dedication during the event that ran from July to September was greatly appreciated.  Thank you!\n\n266#Looking both ways|We've got less days ahead of us than behind us on the journey to Workhuman Live Online. But there's no coasting downhill for this team. Some of the work is ramping up, some of it is continuing to speed along. You've all been putting forth your best efforts,  and many extra hours. The shared experiences build not only the event but also keeps the department strong. Cheers to you!\n\n267#Dependable|Thank you for participating in the daily Workhuman Live Online progress report update... Every day. Stakeholder management and communications are a big part of any project's success. I appreciate your commitment and teamwork on this on top of all your other responsibilities!\n\n268#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n269#Lifting Spirits and Registrations!|Jeff - Really great job taking on the mantle of digging deep to come up with new ways we can reach our potential WHL Online audience. You rose to the challenge, rallied troops and presented a clear set of options for the team to consider and ultimately action on the core team call. Let's keep pushing hard, showing grit, and getting after this. We've got this! -C\n\n270#Host with the Most..... Brainstorming Ideas|Great social distance brainstorm today!  Thank you for proposing and hosting an outdoor brainstorm on how to drive the Workhuman Live Online registrations.  It was a much needed opportunity to connect with the team and come up with some WOW ideas on how to achieve our goals.  I think we have some good concepts to run with - plus it was just fantastic to see the humans in person.  I'm excited to keep the momentum going.  Thanks again for getting the group together!\n\n271#A problem shared is a problem halved|Thank you so much for your help and patience last night helping identify the issue with Comcast affecting access to our site, I would have been completely blind if it wasn't for your willingness to help out another Human!\n\n272#Teamwork makes the dream work|Jeff this is overdue but I wanted to thank you for taking a keen eye to the Time to Thrive webinar series program plan last week and providing your feedback. You are incredibly talented at managing programs and driving acquisition to events – you’re always thinking of all the things – and I really appreciate your input. You asked thought provoking questions that helped ensure all potential audiences were considered in full, and provided a unique perspective that only served to enhance the overall plan. Thank you for your willingness to provide feedback with short notice, and for your diligence and sincerity.\n\n273#Online and On Point|Matt, Jon, Jeff - Thank you for your quick work this week to make sure our WHL Online registrants have a terrific and consistent experience regardless of which website property they engage with. I am very excited about the overall look and feel of the sites! With gratitude, -C\n\n274#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n275#Trusting the process!|Team - thank you for buying into and committing to the new process and approach we're using to develop an integrated and collaborative 2H Marketing Plan (ie., offsite, collaboration, data-driven goal setting, etc.). Because of your willingness to lean into this new way of working we've been able to advance new creative, powerful, innovative ideas for 2H digital programming, virtual engagements, and WHL-S that tap into the zeitgeist, create urgency, represent that Companies that thrive Workhuman, in a way that is unique to our Brand and business. With gratitude, Chris & Patti\n\n276#Consistent Communication and Inclusion|Jeff,  I can't tell you how much I appreciate that you consistently keep me informed and included in all the discussions about our revised events strategy.  In addition to our morning check ins, it is so helpful to me to be able to participate in the larger strategy sessions.  Given our primary focus on events, and the fact that the pandemic has thrown all of our original 2020 plans out the window, it has been really important to me to participate in the conversations on how we will evolve our strategy.  It allows me to really understand where we need to go, and gives me some peace of mind as well!\n\n277#The future is now. The future is working human.|Team - this group has been the nucleus for \"what's next.\" You've ripped up and thrown away the rule book for what was. You've embraced the freedom, liberation and inspiration that comes from having a blank sheet of paper to operate from. Yes, we've been grinding the last two weeks, but we are on the precipices of exciting concepts that will propel our brand and business forward. Keep pushing, we're nearly there. With gratitude, -C\n\n278#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n279#43 slacks in 19 minutes - that's some data|Yes, that's what you did together. Members of the whl-stream-tech channel - between 1:00 and 1:19 you urgently yet calmly worked together to troubleshoot, problem solve, implement, and communicate a workaround. I was watching you. You saved the day because you worked together and responded decisively. Sweat and tears, and a whole lot of teamwork.  Not to imply there were not many backup plans and scenarios discussed in advance because there was no shortage of that. But when the moment came, decisions needed to be made, action needed to be taken... and you did all that. Kudos.\n\n280#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n281#All the right things in all the right places|The Workhuman Livestream is going live tomorrow!!! There have been so many moving parts, who is involved? where will it live? when will we have approval? what about follow up? is that contract signed? This group has kept up with every turn, crazy leap, and last-minute \"yes, and...\"! I cannot thank you all enough for how on top of everything you have been. I feel like the whole team was kept in step and it has been because of your constant communication, reminders, and check ins! We are in the home stretch!!! Thank you!\n\n282#Workhuman Live Stream Support!|Jeff, Eileen and Kristen - thank you all so much for your support in short order this past week to help get C-level Live Stream promotions to customers! Eileen, this was your brain child - really appreciate the support on the content and messaging review. Jeff, your quick help to get this into the queue and push it along for us - you certainly had A LOT going on this week, so appreciate this support. And Kristen, thanks for packing this all up in a bow and driving the pieces into implementation, again very quickly. Great teamwork all!\n\n283#Spotlight Speaker Success Stories|Team - thank you for stepping into the spotlight during our last three marketing town halls. You’ve shown at an exemplary level of innovation, determination, and grit amidst our new normal. You’ve conveyed your success stories (Merck webinar, Keeping work human series, and WHL) with an awesome combination of humility and accessibility. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being leaders of the moment and in the moment. The best practices you’ve shared and modeled to achieve such high levels of success are great guideposts and shining examples of a high performing culture ! Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n284#Wait! Was that really only 90 days?!|Team - Thank you for making this next phase of our journey and evolution together as a team so successful! Lets just say the first 60 day together were much different than our last 30 days together(ish)! Wanted to celebrate all we’ve done together in our first 3 months as a team. Attached is my quick recap and where I see us delivering results in Q2. Thank you, I’m truly appreciative of all you do!  With gratitude, -C\n\n285#DC+IS= A great team|Jeff, thank you always being bringing your best to every conversation and project. Your organized and thoughtful approach brings such clarity to everything we work on together. I appreciate you being such a great sounding board for all of my ideas and an all around great teammate.\n\n286#Questions & Answers = Crushing it|The questions were: \"Are you there?\" \"You working?\" \"Can you come inside on this beautiful Sunday?\" The answers from this group were \"Yes!\" \"How can I help?\" \"Be right there!\"  Thank your dedication, time out of your weekend (or your whole weekend), and flexibility. For answering your phone, responding to texts, jumping on calls, endless Slacks, and using Workfront ;-)  Multiple communication channels are needed to launch a promotional campaign in 4 days, over a weekend, while working remotely. I am proud of you, to be a part of this team, and for what we accomplished together. Thank you.\n\n287#You can’t get more “Live” than that!|Chris, Jeff, Jill - I’m so impressed with the leadership, speed and agility you’ve demonstrated to wrestle a plan for our first all digital WHL event to the ground. The campaign is of the moment relevant, the creative feels on brand fresh, and the determination of your efforts comes clearly through in the Day 1 results. Where others might say ten thousand what?! You’ve said - got it! ... And here’s the plan! Some folks see a countdown clock and say “yikes, pressure.” This group of event and marketing pros says, “pressure makes diamonds!” Excited to see this team shine bright like a diamond and be heads down on execution. Keep up the great work, and keep leading to show the impossible is possible! With gratitude, -C\n\n288#Secret PM skills|Jeff - the Workhuman LiveStream train has left the station. Thank you for organizing all of the assets, channels, messages needed so once the work was introduced, the very large team was able to jump aboard. The time you spent giving clear direction will save hours and keep us working efficiently. Cheers to lists of things... with dates!\n\n289#Daily Check Ins|Every.  Single.  Day.  Since the corona crisis began!   Our morning check ins are really invaluable to me.  You keep me looped in on all the leadership meetings, updated priorities, and things coming down the pipeline.  It helps me stay on task, engaged and motivated.  It is what Workhuman is all about - and your management is a great example of that every day!  Thank you!\n\n290#Virtual Events Planning|Jeff, Thank you for organizing and leading a great meeting to discuss our virtual event strategy and plans. It was an informative and productive discussion for our teams, and so critical to get us all on the same page for the rest of the year. Our event plans have obviously turned upside down, and it was perfect timing to come together to share plans, ideas, and determine coordinated next steps. Looking forward to all of us working together to create amazing online experiences for our customers and future customers!\n\n291#Always in my corner|As my official transition draws near, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you, Jeff, for always being in my corner. From day one, you have been a wise mentor, resilient leader, and someone I can go to with anything. You've even welcomed feedback from me with open arms and without judgement. It is bittersweet to be moving on to a new team, as the past 7 months working with you have been some of the highest points of my career to date. I've learned so much from you in terms of leadership and inspiring people to do their best work, focusing on the task at hand, and setting realistic expectations for myself and others. You've also been so very communicative during this weird time in history.... You are constantly checking in on me (even though I've pretty much officially moved onto a new team) and you're always ready with a much-needed DAD JOKE!! Thank you for all the laughs, hard work, and especially the beer (costumes and actual beer). Thanks for everything, Jeff! PS - When does a joke become a Dad Joke? When it becomes apparent!\n\n292#Best. Team. Ever.|Thank you for a great Zoom meeting to align around our short term priorities while daring to dream and proactively plan for longer term priorities. Not an easy task to do when the \"here and now\" is all anyone of us can think about lately. I was so impressed with everyone's willingness to think about team resources in a different way and also our shared commitment to the good work and strategic thinking that we already did together pre COVID-19 crisis. This was my most productive meeting of the day and an awesome way to end the week. I am grateful for this awesome team. Thank you!\n\n293#Partners!|Jeff (the original, Jeff) was so great to partner with you today on new hire onboarding! Thanks for being so prepared and open to flexibility on timing as well #poweroutage. You're a great team mate!!!!\n\n294#Media Placements with a Red Bow On Top|In the face of the WHL postponement, you pivoted our advertising and took charge to make sure each and every contract had the terms either updated or made more flexible for Workhuman. I greatly appreciate the care in which you documented available placements and which dates we could repurpose with other priority marketing messages. It was neatly wrapped with a red bow on top!\n\n295#Well that was NOT in my 30/60/90 day plan! ...|Team - A quick thank you to celebrate being 60 days in together. You continue to adapt to the businesses needs and lead through uncertain times with a high demonstrated commitment to the priorities we've aligned on to grow the business - ie., Build the brand; Acquire new customer; Grow existing customers; and Build our culture through people. Although COVID was in NO ONE'S playbook, you rallied and risen to this new challenge by partnering with me on a slightly \"revised\" version of my 30/60/90 plan. This is having such a positive halo effect on our teams. Look forward to the next 30 days of the plan ... whatever that looks, and with confidence that if we need to write it 1 page, 1 day at a time - this is the team I'm excited to do it with. Stay healthy, human, and connected! With gratitude, -C\n\n296#Now that's what a call teamwork!|Jill, Jeff - what do you do when you lose power while working from home amidst COVID crisis? The only logical thing, drive to a colleague's house and work in their garage. True teamwork, determination, and grit. Amazing example of teamwork and commitment to the business and each other. With gratitude, C\n\n297#Communication & Support|This is long overdue, for sure.  Jeff, thank you for your continuous support and guidance since I joined the team.  The first couple of months, you made sure to get me up to speed on all things Workhuman Live and gave me the opportunity to go off and “just do” what needed to get done.  And then, it all blew up.  ?.  Now, more than ever, you’ve made sure to communicate, provide direction, and keep spirits high as we navigate this strange time.  I can’t tell you how reassuring that’s been .  So glad to be a part of you’re team.  Now, let’s go GSD!\n\n298#Demand Gen Strong|Team, this is long overdue!  I want to thank each of you for welcoming me to the team and taking time to help me get up to speed on all things Workhuman.  It’s such a pleasure to work on a team that is so supportive of one another.  Miss seeing you all everyday, but until we are back in the office, I look forward to the daily slack conversations and, of course, the dad jokes.\n\n299#Is it still Wednesday?|Team -  First, thank you - often and always.  Second, I want to acknowledge we are operating in unprecedented times. This can trigger feelings of discomfort and anxiety if you let it. But, I believe we are strong enough together to rally, support, and mobilize each other to overcome that potential because you all as leaders already have. Know that every moment of progress you’ve made this week already illustrates your strength, determination, and grit.  In the broader context - none of us are guaranteed a tomorrow - COVID may exacerbate that mindset - but in reality this too shall pass and we all will be stronger from it - personally and professionally.  I believe in you. And I believe in us together. Our collective strengths to overcome and our true human spirit to persevere will best this.  I am honored to serve alongside you in the pursuit of our brand, our customers, and the greater community we serve.  Thank you for all your support, kindness, and compassion you've extended to me this week!  With gratitude, -C\n\n300#A Virtual First|Anne, Diane, Holly, Jeff, Jill, Kelsey and Kristen – thank you so much for the call that turned into my first virtual birthday party ever! Talk about staying connected in times of uncertainty and virtual human moments that matter! You all are so thoughtful and caring. Today had the potential to be a bit glum between all the craziness that is COVID, the mandatory isolation and the dreary weather but you have made sure to add a whole lot of light and laughter into my day. Thanks for all the love and thoughtfulness – I have certainly felt it! Best. Teammates. Ever.\n\n301#A tough day, a great team|Each one of you exhibited all of our values today but I chose Respect for All because we had a lot of decisions today that required us being in agreement and with a path to move forward very quickly and everyone did it in a respectful, efficient way. This was not a fun meeting - we all love WHL and are dedicated to it being perfect. Today, though we were taking it apart, was no exception. Everyone concentrated on the right message for our audience, thoughtfully went through all affected segments, and delivered a great plan. I'm so proud to work with each one of you and hope we are back together very soon planning '21!\n\n302#On top of it all|This award is long overdue. Jeff, I just wanted to point out how much you've been juggling in recent weeks and keeping your cool on top of it all. What unique and tumultuous times we live in with Covid-19 sweeping the land. But, even before that, you were handling a multitude of Workhuman Live initiatives from new Keynote Speaker announcements, to the Teams program, Humans Unite, Speaker Bundles, Podcasts, Re-evaluating our budget spend, and more. Too much to list, really. Not only are you forecasting registration goals on a regular basis, pivoting on media tactics, but you're also strategically planning for Dublin and beyond. With that, I really appreciate your willingness to jump in and help cover for me while I am away. You're dedication to teamwork is truly admirable and it shows in not only the way you help your team without question, but your open communication style as well. Now that we are dealing with the added layer of this global pandemic throwing just a slight wrench into things, I am truly grateful to have you to look to for guidance on \"all the things\" and know I can count on you to make the right decisions for our team and the business!\n\n303#Parental Unit|Jill and Jeff, Over the past week I've come to think of you as the parents of Workhuman Live. Parenting an event is rewarding and hard. The event changes and goes through phases. Sometimes the event keeps you up at night. Some days you don't see eye-to-eye on the best approach to raising an event but you respectfully work together to figure it out. You each bring unique and valid perspectives to the role. Sometimes it is hard to watch your event go through a rough patch but you believe the event will make it and grow from the experience. Thank you for being the parents of Workhuman Live. The event is in good hands because of your dedication and exhausting efforts. Be proud of the movement you are raising!\n\n304#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n305#Customers Belong at WHLive!|Dear Dream Team,   I am thankful for the opportunity to have worked with each of you this past quarter. All of you provided great insight into the Workhuman Live conference culture, shared past experiences, and areas we (Customer Success) could use to level set on our approach to pitching Workhuman Live to customers. Patrick, you shot it out the park with the WHLive Elevator Pitch Builder. This great exercise will help verbalize our thoughts regarding the importance of this conference. With that said, Tim, you absolutely captured the audience with your honesty and brought the facts to back up why Customers no matter the level or location should join in the WH movement. Judith, you are right! There is no wrong time to introduce WHLive and we should use our excitement from past conferences fuel customers to register. Dan, you took the time to review all the PowerPoints, documents, created a presentation timeline, lead meetings, and kept us on our toes. Furthermore, you didn’t mind answering my million questions on the presentation deck.   Jill and Jeff, thank you for creating the WHLive playbook deck. This resource which includes customer testimonials will truly help us with recruitment.   Couldn’t leave out our leaders, Danielle and Liz. You both prioritized our team meetings, listened to us gather our thoughts, and boldly asked us to reconsider our approaches for a centralized recruitment method. Without your guidance, this wouldn’t have been possible.   What I learned from working with this team is that we truly live and are fueled by the Workhuman experience with the common goal of inspiring other companies to reconsider the future of work. Excited to hear all the Moments that Matter at this years WHLive!   Sincerely, Kel\n\n306#Determination + Grit = Growth|Team - I was very excited to see the latest projections for WHL double down on Sunday. This is hard and important work you are doing to drive human moments that matter globally complicated by worldwide challenges above/beyond our control. Your consistency, determination, and unrelenting drive to succeed are paying off based on the +14% YOY increase vs. same time LY with a projected 3,721 registrants. Keep pushing. And in words of Bruce Springsteen, “Getting an audience is hard. Sustaining an audience is hard. It demands a consistency of thought, of purpose and of action over a long period of time.”  With gratitude, -C\n\n307#Best First 30 Days Ever!|Team - I was reflecting on how much we've accomplished during our first month together. I selected Urgency for this note because it best reflects what all of you have demonstrated - ie., the asap tackling of tough challenges with a sense of Shoshin (初心) a word from Zen Buddhism meaning \"beginner's mind.\" To me this means displaying an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. This truly captures the dynamic we've co-built and are accelerating progress in. A quick recap of five significant things we've accomplished together: 1.) Alignment with cross functional partners (SLT, CS/CX, and MLT); 2.) Re-organizing to achieve FY20 priorities and accelerate growth; 3.) Moving the needle toward stronger, crisper, more provocative marketing messages; 4.) As leaders, together, building a shared model of transparency, trust, and robust debate; and 5.) Leveling up to strategic joint business planning. In ways big and small you have made me feel welcome, informed, and more self-aware of how to build a successful team. Jill from our dine around and leadership on Demand 2.0, to Pam with your advice on language for positioning the re-org, to Jeff from your \"get it done and here's what I need from you clarity\" on all things WHL audience acquisition and shared love of sarcasm, to Z your willingness to be the glue between teams and dedicate source for Girl Scout cookies - I want to say thank you for all we've done together and a \"save\" a future thank you for all we will do together. Happy Friday to all - keep up the great human work - it matters. With gratitude, -C\n\n308#We have lift off!|I wanted to thank all of you for the total team effort that was the creation and launch of the new Workhuman Live Europe website. This was an incredibly fast turnaround with many moving parts, from implementing new branding to building a preliminary agenda to getting Bizzabo up and running for registration. It's hard to believe that in the middle of an already crazy few weeks this team was able to quietly and efficiently create a fantastic new site that will introduce more of the world to the amazing experience that is Workhuman Live. Well done!\n\n309#People-First Leadership|Team - I wanted to recognize the effort that went into our recent Customer Marketing re-alignment. Driven by and reflective of your input and support we implemented changes that were perceived positively by the business, and by - putting people first and considering the human aspects involved in change - have been received positively as growth and on-strategy changes by the great humans that make up the Customer Marketing organization. I thought it was important to celebrate this moment, because change is often scary, especially for teams in flux - but your advice and guidance around putting people first (always) directly influenced a plan that was highly communicative, well-scheduled, and well-executed by all involved. We are well on our way to the modernization of our Customer Marketing function. Thank you for building strong relationships on this journey - I'm optimistic they will pay dividends throughout FY20 and beyond! With gratitude, -C\n\n310#Breakfast Club|Thank you all for coming in on a Saturday to test the WHL session registration module before we promote it. It is critical to our success that this functions properly, is easy to use, and correct messages are conveyed all without disrupting ongoing reg. I’m proud to be part of a team with such dedication. I appreciate all of you.\n\n311#Testing 1, 2, 1, 2|Thank you for giving part of your Saturday to come into the office to test Workhuman Live session selection. We needed to test at a time when minimal people would be on the site and you were willing and able to help. Because of your participation we are able to provide a quality session selection experience for our attendees. I appreciate your commitment and time. Cheers!\n\n312#I honestly loooovvvve you….|On this Valentine’s day. I must say how amazing this team really is. Day in and day out; early birds getting the worm, cranking on all the things. There is literally no challenge too big, no project too small, no task too insignificant. Each of you are always digging in; laser focused on what is the best thing for the business, approaching all of your work with thoughtful strategies and supporting one another. I thank every single day I get the privilege of working with such an exceptional group of marketers.\n\n313#Man on a mission.|Hi Jeff - I just wanted to say thank you for your honesty and candor during our 1:1 Friday. Our conversation yielded great insights around the importance of testing and iterating to get to more new ideas and approaches. I also really liked your idea of a customer advisory board to bring even more customer-centric perspective to shaping our go-to-market materials. Some great brainstorm ideas that I will take the follow ups on as I know you are heads down in WHLive acquisition. This is the kind of honest, robust, and creative dialogue I am excited to see building in the team. I also really appreciated seeing your passion and hearing how committed you are to building the audiences for Live! With gratitude, -C\n\n314#WH Live Partnership|I had a session with Jeff yesterday and it was great to hear all the ways he is mapping out strategies to optimize WH live for our customer and prospects. We spent some time discussing ideas to best follow up the event and help carry over the great feeling and turn into pipeline. Excited to partner on this event with Jeff.\n\n315#Hidden Heroes, Team Focus|All - I wanted to thank you for all of your collective work on an upcoming keynote announcement for Workhuman Live 2020. I greatly appreciate your focus and diligence to getting the package complete and ready for speaker approval. As we all know, approvals can often take more time than we'd like - but your ability to get this package done in a timely and high quality way is amazing. Well done to all of you and thank you for your efforts. Can't wait to see it out in market!\n\n316#Ignite Dine Around 2020|Thank you all for a wonderful evening at Fogo de Chao on Wednesday.  We had such a fun time and all of your were great sports in sharing stories, goals, dreams and favorites.  What an interesting group!  Skydivers and gamers, vikings and ranchers who have hiked in the mountains, played little league for a mobster, grew up speaking French (and then forgot it all), fought in a cage and witnessed surgery up close.  Our collective last meals would be a fine feast indeed!  With so many famous people!  It was a sincere pleasure getting to know all of you.  And in case you were wondering what that \"interesting\" drink was that Julie ordered...it's called Fernet Branca.  Our official team beverage!\n\n317#Being OK with a Pivot!|Team! Wanted to thank you for the time this week getting together to discuss the second half of Workhuman Live audience acquisition. As we get continue this journey leading up to the event, it's so important that we are always looking at the results and being willing to pivot when needed. Greatly appreciate the willingness to collaborate, think outside of the box and respectfully challenge one another. Cheers to a great session and can't wait to see the outcomes!\n\n318#Wonderful support|Hi Jeff, You went out of your way to support the Partner with something which was completely optional. Its very much appreciated both from myself and the Partner.  Thank you, Niall\n\n319#Hackathon Preparation Brilliance!|I wanted to thank you so much for your help with the Workhuman Live Hackathon this week.  Stacey, Cara, Tamra, and Jill: Awesome work ensuring the team was well hydrated and full of snacks to draw out all of the brilliance of the group in the room! Holly, Mark and Anne, appreciate your willingness to lend a hand bringing supplies over to 100, arriving early to help setup and staying late to help clean up. And last but, not least, a HUGE call out to Jeff, for the endless hours of prep work that went into ensuring the afternoon had a great flow and would be productive for all of those involved, really amazing work team!\n\n320#Trying Something Different!|Amazing demand and field team, wanted to take a moment to say a huge thank you for spending a few hours after a busy holiday season to try something different! Rather than just running through a traditional planning process complete with PPT slides and grids; you all immersed yourselves in something uncommon; roasts and toasts, sticky notes (big and small!) and breaking into teams (outside of your own 'lane') - hackathon style! So happy to see such amazing ideas free-flowing, tremendous collaboration and the willingness to try something completely out of the ordinary and be SUPER engaged during it all. Way to go gang, and so excited to see what 2020 brings for this group of stars!\n\n321#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n"
"322#28 this quarter!|28 humans. That's how many people assisted in one way or another with the Q4 year-end, last meeting of the decade and for each and every one of you, I am grateful! It's pretty incredible to think about the village that comes together to make this meeting happen. From confirming our speakers, creating slides, providing content, answering my many questions, testing and testing and testing (yes, 3x) the technology to provide a great experience for all, to ringing the gong - each of you receiving this award was integral to the overall success of the meeting.\n\n323#now i can admit it.. you kiiind of scared me there|A whole new registration process for Workhuman Live 2020?!?... I'd be lying if I said this news thrilled me back in June.  Every year we've faced our share of challenges, but at least I knew what )*@#%$ to expect.  I was living in fear of a new set of issues, and the hours of troubleshooting that followed.  Six months in... nothing.  Literally nothing.  Even when I think something goes awry, one of you will bulldoze my concerns.  You guys have made such a positive impact to this critical business process.  I cannot say enough how much I appreciate the effort and talent of this team!\n\n324#WH Live  - we hit our first milestone!!!!|Team,  I am so proud of, energized and inspired by each of you!  We have hit our first milestone!  Your creativity, dedication and action bias have been evident from day 1!   I truly look forward to taking this exceptional movement forward with this tremendously talented team. On behalf of everyone that will be lucky enough to enjoy WH Live, Thank You!\n\n325#HIRED!|Jeff - Congratulations on your newest hire!  Thank you so much for amazing partnership throughout the Sr. Events Marketing Programs Manager.  From a thoughtful kick-off, combing your network, productive feedback sessions, timely and prompt feedback, and all the way to a hire - you crushed this search.  Thank you for prioritizing this, and thank you for your support along the way.  I had never recruited in the audience acquisition marketing space, so your insight and guidance was so helpful and appreciated.  You prepped your interview team perfectly, and they all uncovered appropriate and helpful insights/feedback.  YAY to working with Anne again!  I am so excited to see the great work she will do.  To more successful hires in the future!\n\n326#Cyber Monday Maestro!|Jeff,  absolutely amazing work on orchestrating the monster promotion that is, CYBER MONDAY.  You worked diligently with a large team, got everyone to rally, and worked tirelessly to ensure all of the pieces where in place so all can execute flawlessly. I'm excited to see if we can meet our big goals around this one, but have never felt more confident with you at the helm! Keep on with your amazing leadership, teamwork and drive!\n\n327#You are there, and there, and there...|Jeff - the past week has been a flurry of activity to get the Workhuman Live housing site up at the same time we launched Cyber Monday. It meant chasing down approvals and finding answers to open questions. On Slack, via text, at your desk, impromptu standing regroup. You were everywhere, willing to respond, answer, and think through what we needed to finish to get the job done. All with a great attitude. You are certainly not the person that you represented in the recent video, and for that I am thankful. Cheers!\n\n328#You put the instant in instant message|This year, with the new structure for codes for WH, you've been incredibly easy to reach and overly helpful when it comes to questions on everything related to codes and discounts for WH. Additionally, your overview of the Cyber deal we're running was excellent and you got back to me instantly on my few questions. This helps me/us in sales get educated quicker and in a more streamlined fashion than in past years. It also helps us all have the same information so our reach outs and prospecting is clear, succinct, and consistent. I greatly appreciate the efforts and I'm looking forward to this being further streamlined as we get closer to the event. Thanks Jeff.\n\n329#Stay Late Greats|Thank you all in your amazing help in our recent video shoot for some gratitude campaign promotions. Kristen, you mentioned this was way out of your comfort zone but I don't think anyone would guess that by the way you seemed totally comfortable, even if you were screaming internally. You were naturally great and took direction like pro, and I'm not just saying that. Jeff, what can I say. You filled the role of the thoughtless ominous jerk boss maybe a little too well. Kidding aside, you were naturally great, and took direction perfectly. The two of you together were a perfect combo. Now we just need some chocolate and marshmallows with those two Grahams.....*ba-dum-tss*. James, you and I both know, but I doubt everyone else knows just how valuable it is to have two people working shoot instead of one. Thank for shifting your schedule and staying late to not only help out with equipment on set, but also be a second pair of eyes. It's so critical to have someone not distracted by operating equipment to help direct and spot check during a shoot. Thank you all for your help, amazing work, and keep your phones on because there WILL be a next one!\n\n330#The man with the plan|This award feels long overdue! It struck me, as I was watching you present where we are in the promotions plan for Workhuman Live at the WHWednesday, just how much you have accomplished – and you are still so NEW!! I cannot overstate how strategic and thoughtful your plan is to get us to our goal – and not just for the 2020 event, but looking at the long game of how we will evolve it over time and the structures you are putting into place now that will serve as the foundation for years to come. I can say without a doubt that we are in the best position we have ever been leading up to this event. AND, you are a joy to work with, to throw crazy ideas at, to have a beer with...Thank you a million!\n\n331#Vacation Coverage|Thank you both for covering for me while I was on holiday this past week with my family :) Jeff - You not only made sure I felt comfortable with everything before I left and recapped what I missed as soon as I returned but, you also really stepped in and covered my day-to-day without blinking an eye. You were sending 3rd party materials to our agency partners, launching Dan Heath web, email social etc., updating the Wiki so our internal teams had everything they needed, and kicked off multiple projects in such a short period of time. Do you even really need me here, or should I just go back to Florida? It's too cold here anyways ;)  Jill - Thank you so much for stepping and writing a great brief to get the 'Justify Your Trip' project into the queue. Ensuring we have this valuable asset available to our prospective attendees prior to launching the Cyber Monday promotion will be critical. It's surely to pay off in the long run!  I am so happy to be able to work with and learn from the both of you... But, the fact that I can also count on you to roll up your sleeves and help out when it is needed, now THAT is just the definition of a great team!! Count me #blessed and super #grateful. Thanks again to you both for allowing me enjoy moments like the one pictured above without fretting about what was happening in the office. xoxo #bestteamever\n\n332#Jeff to the rescue|Jeff, thanks for your help in getting a team registered for Workhuman Live. A speaker came to me saying that she wanted to bring 12 people but their corporate card wasn't processing in our system. Once I introduced her team member to you I knew she was in good hands. You were responsive to her questions and kept her updated as you found a way to make it work. You set up an invoicing process and now team Shopify is in! Thanks for being so reliable and helpful in this situation.\n\n333#Amazing WHLive Update!!!|Team, I was so proud and happy that today we got the opportunity to showcase the tremendous work, planning and thoughtfulness that has been happening behind the scenes on WHLive.  Each of you brought your ‘A’ game and collectively we were able to demonstrate the commitment to bringing this movement forward and harnessing its’ strength for the company!  I am so inspired by each of you every day!  Thank you!!!\n\n334#Follow up!|Jeff, wanted to thank you for your quick work stepping in to handle Workday Rising follow up! You took action getting the pieces in place to send out promotions quickly, but also took a ton of time (well spent!) making sure our partners in sales had everything they needed to follow up quickly and effectively. Thank you for never hesitating to lend a hand a help team members out!\n\n335#Thoughtful Juggling!|Diane, Jeff and Kristen - what can I say. An amazing Q3. Wanted to take the moment to recognize the seemingly endless juggling this team has been doing! Kristen, balancing the load on customers is no easy feat. You have taken on a new hire, brought into the mix ABM and continued with the day to day support of our CSM team - all while trying new initiatives and tactics to move the needle with our customers.  Diane, you certainly got a shove into demand gen in a hurry in Q3. You took it on with gusto and learned the ins and outs of all the things. You also take time to think through the smallest of details to keep us all on our toes! And Jeff, Workhuman Live is firing on all cylinders. Your thoughtful approach to that event (and third party too!) has put us in a much better spot to lean into our lofty goals. No matter what comes this team's way, I know you folks have GOT IT! Thanks for being so amazing!\n\n336#Teamwork and trust!|Jeff - This award is slightly overdue, and extremely well-deserved. You have been such a force here at Workhuman from (presumably) the day you started, and most definitely since my return from maternity leave. I’m so impressed with your hard work and dedication to owning everything as it relates to Audience Acquisition. From working across the organization with all stakeholders, to taking into account the data we have available to inform planning and program management, through to team communications, optimizations, and more. The way you think about each and every program we launch or issue we face is smart, calculated, calm, and analytical. I’ve already learned so much from working with you in the past 6 weeks! Much of that is due to the way you are able to coach me in the moment and your openness to looping me into situations as learning opportunities. Additionally, you’ve been so great with helping me work though some of my challenges since coming back to a vastly different marketing organization and for that, I’m immensely grateful. The fact that you value a manager/direct report relationship based on trust is also something I greatly admire. You've made it clear form day one that you trust me to do my job and that I can trust you right back. I couldn’t have asked for a better manager (um, hi, you got me DONUTS on my first day back) to collaborate with on a daily basis, and the Workhuman Live team couldn't have found a better-suited leader. The results say it all: 498 registrations! That's 20% ahead of where we were at this point in the 2019 promotional program! ? ? ? I think we make a great team, Jeff. It’s good to have you in the band!!\n\n337#TEAM(s) Effort!|Holly and Jeff! CRUSHING the Workhuman Live teams program! The amount of strategy, thoughtfulness and data mining was unreal! I am thrilled to see a program which such amazing substance and value emerge. Appreciate the countless hours that have gone into building something amazing for our customers, future customers to drive real value at WHL - AMAZING work!!!!\n\n338#Thanks to you...|I reached out to each of you to pick your brains on the last major relaunch of our website, spearheaded by Matt and also the recent work led by Jeff on the current WH Live website. I want to learn from these past projects to inform how to best approach upcoming website work. You both took time out of your busy schedules, to comb through your old emails and files and share everything you thought would be helpful to me. Thank you for recognizing that leveraging your past experiences and unique perspectives will help me help US achieve our goals as we seek to improve the experience WH.com delivers in the future.\n\n339#Group wisdom!|Team - I just wanted to express my gratitude and excitement coming out of today’s sprint retrospective. What a great discussion around our insights from the past couple of weeks. Not only did we celebrate our shared successes but we also looked ahead to future goals and examined realistic ways to achieve them as a team. I hope we continue having these “after parties” in the future as I feel they are a shining example of cross-team collaboration at its finest! Great job everyone and thank you for taking the time today!\n\n340#Reporting Rockstars!|Well, I don't know if reporting is AS exciting as being at an amazing concert; but this team certainly made it feel close! Thanks so much for the help and prep work in our Q2 demand review. Pulling this data and not just reporting, but analyzing is no small feat. I am so grateful to work with an amazing team that take reporting as seriously as I do. I think we made this quarter's easier for the team to digest and excited for the Q3 version! Go team!\n\n341#The real plan.|Jeff, thank you so much for going above and beyond digging into our plan at HR Tech 2019. I literally Slacked you 5 minutes before a meeting asking you to join and you sprung into action. Adding insight and thoughtful suggestion to a meeting you had no chance to prep for! I also appreciate you taking the lead on pulling together the straw man to keep us organized and squeezing every last bit of juice on the opportunity to ensure this event is successful not only leading up, during and post event too! Well done you.\n\n342#Workhuman Live Web MVPs!|Today we kicked off the 2020 WorkHuman Live web campaign with the MVP launch of the new workhumanlive.com thanks to the incredible efforts of this team. I was so impressed with creativity and skill you all brought to every phase of design and development. From our initial brainstorming session earlier this summer through every morning sprint there was always a drive to innovate and improve our online experience, while remaining hyper focused on our goal to drive registrations. You all took great care through your work to represent the very best of the Workhuman brand and on-site experience. This was only the beginning of what I’m sure what will be an exciting year. I can’t wait to see what we can we accomplish together!\n\n343#A sweet first day back|Thank you guys so much for keeping me abreast of all the happenings around here while I was out on maternity leave, and for a super sweet first day back in the office. Coming in today to donuts, Night Shift, and pretty flowers on my desk put a huge smile on my face and I really can’t say enough about how much it meant to get a surprise like that on my first day back. Jeff  - I am already so impressed with the great work you are doing and am looking forward to digging into it all with you! Thanks again for a great first day and your help with the transition!\n\n344#B is for Bizzabo|When you are working with a new vendor using new software, and the main contact with that vendor is no longer involved... you need a Plan B. Thank you all for being part of Plan B for Bizzabo. You were ready, willing, able, nimble, and responsive in getting up to speed with the platform. You set up the program, tested it, connected it, troubleshooted, learned the ins and outs, developed copy and creative, and collectively tackled the Bizzabo beast!   Thank you for all of your time and attention in a very important step on the trail to San Antonio. The Workhuman Live 2020 reg site is open for bizzness because of your efforts - cheers!\n\n345#'The Art of Gathering' Live Experience & Workshop|Kevin, Jeff, and Jill, thanks for your openness to a content related idea I had for the Monday of Workhuman Live. I’ve been following an up-and-coming speaker for the last few months and after I had a preliminary call with her team, I just knew she’d be the right fit for our audience. It’s an interactive workshop, which of course requires a team effort to execute. Jill, you jumped on board right away with a few suggestions on where and how to implement it. Jeff, you asked all the right questions from a promotional standpoint to make sure we convey the value effectively to potential attendees. Kevin, per usual you give me the opportunity to explore any speaker, topic, or session format that could bring value to the conference. We’re in the final stages of getting this wrapped up and I’m excited to put it into motion.\n\n346#WH Live Hackathon!|Jeff, wanted to send you a huge moment of gratitude. The idea to pull together a hackathon to crowd-source WH audience acquisition came across your desk swiftly and needed action. Like you do with all things, you took a step back to determine the best way to approach this to maximize the output. Not only did you think through the agenda and appropriate background needed; you did hero’s work pulling together the logistics and the format, we even had homework ahead of the meeting! And of course, in true Workhuman fashion, provided us with endless amount of Post-It notes and cupcakes to fuel the amazing ideas! Thanks for acting swiftly, all while being thoughtful and strategic. You are a Rockstar!\n\n347#Wh Live Agenda Building|Many thanks to this group for your time brainstorming the Workhuman Live agenda layout. Now is the time for us to look at different options and ask all of the questions. “How many sessions is the right amount?” “Where can there be more facilitated networking?” And most importantly, “What can we do next year that’s new and different?” Next step, our site visit in two weeks to test some layouts and floor plans!\n\n348#Agenda at a Glance|Or, agenda in a moment.  Thanks all for coming up with a great overview of the important projects happening in Marketing, with just a little notice.  It was not only great to hear about the wonderful work happening in Marketing, but to see you all present it all so beautifully.  I am grateful for the talented team of colleagues we have at the helm and in support of all of these initiatives.  Thank you!\n\n349#Now that is how you workshop!|Huge thanks to the both of you for an invigorating, inspiring and thought provoking workshop. It's not easy to expand beyond the constraints of the past and consider what could be.  Altogether, we were able to clearly articulate the goals of the website, develop a kaleidoscope of elements and innovative ways to enhance experience.  Brilliant work gentlemen!\n\n350#Strategic Experience Mapping Workshops|A big thanks to all of you for coming to the Experience Mapping Workshops ready to share ideas of how we can use WH to help achieve our company goals. It was fantastic to see how aligned everyone is! Your time and dedication will help create the best WH yet with carefully curated experiences that will inspire all attendees and customers. Great job everyone.\n\n351#a heart-worthy start|You've only been here a matter of weeks, but you are already improving my life on a daily basis! We've never had the luxury of being this far ahead of the planning for the WHLive event and the recent meetings have been so organized – and we've made so many decisions! It's a relief knowing that I can let go of this section of my brain because I know you've got a handle on it–even as new as you are. You coming onboard to handle audience acquisition takes it off of everyone on the team who was balancing the mental load of this plus whatever else we do. You've been drinking form the firehose from day one and still kept a great attitude about it all. I am already convinced this is going to be the best year yet! I'm so excited!!!\n\n352#Now that's a ramp up!|Jeff, I wanted to share my gratitude for a wonderful job on your ramp plan! You are diving in and absorbing as much information as you can to better inform yourself of the company goals and how all of the pieces fit into WH Live. I am really impressed by the initiative to build out a 30/60 day outline of achievements so you can stay the course of the next few months. Keep up the amazing work and curiosity to all things Workhuman!\n\n353#Workhuman Registration|Thank you for jumping right in, sharing your perspective, and making a valuable contribution from the start. It is great to have some new eyes and fresh ideas on the road to Workhuman Live.\n\n354#Minimally Viable Presentation|MVP TEAM! WOW! What an amazing feat pulling together one of the best narratives we ever had presented at the ELT meeting today! The information flowed, they were wowed, they laughed, it showed our strengths and highlighted our successes. You ALL were integral to making this come to life, especially during the last minute crunch hours (YAY BRUINS!!!) I was so honored to re-pre-sent all that Marketing has been working on what's to come. You are a fantastic group of humans, so grateful to work with you.\n\n"
