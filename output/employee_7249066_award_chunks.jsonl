"0#What do we want? Data! When do we want it? Now!|Orlagh and Dermot, thank you both so much for supporting our Internal Comms team with the implementation of Bitly. While measuring link clicks doesn't sound fun to most people, it's critical for our team to see what content our humans are engaging with. I, for one, was shocked and appalled to find that Microsoft does not have its own way of tracking clicks, leading us down the long and winding road to what is now the perfect solution.  You have both been stellar help getting this across the line, safely. Thanks for the support\n\n1#The ROLLS ROYCE of Recognition|I am very  PROUD to share that James has sailed through his goal and closed RR for 7.7 million. There is so much goodness to share about this win.  James multithreaded RIGHT at the top and created true advocates. Demonstrating our differentiators around global, ROI and governance, we soon got shortlisted from 5 to 2.    RR pushed us to be creative so he got to work touring their  facilities with Clare and Siobhan and partnered closely with Jim, Lisa and Brenda to create innovative  launch ideas which helped set us apart. Recognition was a priority for their CEO to support their behaviours and drive accountability and given the visibility the project had we had presentation after presentation where every detail was covered. James developed such strong relationship over the time, he was even asked to present to the CEO directly.  Tom L and Eric also met some of the key stakeholders  when at the Forum in London.   Tariff implications gave the CEO a moment of pause but the WH team rallied to ensure we alleviated their concerns, doubling down on how recognition supports their transformation.    So many  partners enabled this – expert guidance from Clare, and Brenda, Mark  helped create a winning RFP,  Moe, Jose, Siobhan, Lisa and Jim were a creative powerhouse, Mark was a consistent support alleviating integration challenges and Orlagh provided Infosec expertise.  Our partners in Finance/ Legal worked hard on a challenging set of negotiations, with special thanks to Hillary, Christie, Chuck, Chris and for executive support from Tom L.   The launch/CE team have been incredible partners and have impressed the RR team thoroughly. So much so that we decided they needed their own separate recognition entirely...   James – you really are an inspiration. You work ethic, your ability to communicate our differentiators, your effectiveness at building trusted relationships, your tenacity and so much more is what enables outcomes like this. You are the GOAT.\n\n2#How do you take your coffee?|A huge thank you to our amazing leaders for being the latest stars of our Coffee With series! You shared everything from personal fun facts and career journeys to department strategies—and so much more—giving our humans the perfect opportunity to get to know you even better by asking all their burning questions. Being in front of the camera is never easy, but each of you took it in your stride and made it look effortless. We were absolutely delighted with the videos and the results—they were insightful, engaging, and a lot of fun! It was such a joy getting to know each of you a little more through this series, and we hope you enjoyed the experience as much as we did. Thank you again for your time, energy, and for helping us brew up such a fantastic series!\n\n3#Bringing in Special Teams for Rolls-Royce|I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge all of the amazing cross-functional work that's happening behind the scenes to get Rolls-Royce over the finish line for launch at the end of October! Orlagh, Enda, and Sheila, you've provided much-needed InfoSec, Privacy, and Legal support, even going so far as to get on a critical meeting with the client's VP of Data Privacy earlier this week. Jason, you led not one, but TWO AI sessions with various stakeholders in support of two different governance gates we need to get through to get this client launched; you set us up not only for the short term, but also planted seeds about long term partnership on the topic of AI in the EU! Alan, Robert, Susan, and Adam, you've all displayed a client-first, flexible approach to a request for a customized intro panel for both desktop and mobile. All of you have been absolutely crucial in demonstrating Workhuman's value as a partner. Some of these conversations and topics have been tricky to manage, and sensitive with the client, but this group of Special Teams players have all showed up on the pitch ready to get it done! Thank you!\n\n4#we ACED the presentation ;)|Team ,  Thank you for rallying round to support all things Ferring! From the Ceros site and beautifully Ferring branded launch materials, to the super slick presentation formatting, to the custom demo site build and design, to the practice pitches, planning sessions AND for a last minute pivot on your calendars for the HRLT meeting (30 minutes earlier than planned!), to the coaching and delivery on the day - every individual contribution made us show up and stand out.  I’m full of gratitude and pride to work with such smart, kind humans who believe in what we do. There’s still work ahead, but the strong foundation we’ve laid has already paid off - our mobiliser told us we delivered the best presentation of all the vendors!  Brava, and thank you.\n\n5#Happy World Gratitude Day!|On this World Gratitude Day I want to recognize your contributions this year so far. A tricky year for all but your dedication and belief in our mission has kept us moving forward. My Thanks for all your efforts this year and for being a valued member of my leadership team. With Gratitude!\n\n6#Excellence in Action|As we wrap up Q3, I want to take a moment to celebrate a group of outstanding humans who have created incredible momentum across the business. This quarter you've shown what it means to have Respect for Quality - working across teams, delivering high-quality work, all while staying focused on what matters most: our mission to make work human. Your commitment to Inspire the HR Industry has shone through in the many accomplishments across the organization. As we head into the final quarter of the year, I’m filled with optimism about what we’ll continue to achieve together. Thank you for your hard work, your passion, and your commitment!\n\n7#Thank you!|Thank you both for picking up the UAR baton while I was OOO unexpectedly! I appreciate you both running in to help get this quarter over the finish line!\n\n8#Security in the Studio!|Orlagh - a bit belated here but wanted to say thank you for your time in the Dublin studio a number of weeks back. We are creating a series of assets for campaign landing pages featuring some of our subject matter experts and you came with great answers to our questions. The session with Gavin was really engaging and we now have a number of clips we can use for advertisement, Sales outreach and overall nurturing prospects. And all designed to show how Workhuman provides the best support in the business, including world class data privacy and security. Thank you!\n\n9#FIL RFP|Team - thank you for your contributions to the FIL RFP pitch this week. With holidays and a brief that required some creativity it was a challenge that asked certain folks to step up and step in with roles and slides that I know in many cases were quite new. We did well to get in the room, and what we delivered generated a lot of engagement and 'food for thought', which I think is a good place to be on this one. Bravo!\n\n10#Thank you!|Dear Orlagh, and Kim, Thank you for understanding how important the AI Assistant Design Partner launch is and enabling access to ensure we are gaining confidence in these launches with final validation on Assistant and ensuring customers having the best possible experience with the premium version of the Assistant.  We really appreciate your understanding and support to make this launch a success.\n\n11#AI Whitepaper v1.0|Thanks all for the contributions towardsour first AI Whitepaper.   This document will arm our field teams and educate our customers/prospects on our approach to leveraging AI.  This document highlights how Human Intelligence is designed responsibly and with security and privacy at the forefront of all decisions.   Your feedback and contributions were essential to ensure we answered the right questions, hit the right tone and articulated complex material clearly and concisely.   Thanks again for all the support\n\n12#KLA Renewal, IA, Welcome Awards, Nextgen HI Launch|Thank you to this entire group, so much effort over the last few months!! We launched HI today, along with Automated Welcome Awards, Inclusion Advisor, and  custom reports to Nextgen reporting to name a few!!  Thank you for attending all the meetings with KLA about security, reporting, HI, IA, Comms, etc.  All of this work helped secure a 4 year, 5 month renewal!  I appreciate everyone working together keeping KLA as a priority!   We have a SAR with them in July and we get to look back at all this great work we completed!  Thanks again!!\n\n13#AI Whitepaper guidance|Thanks Orlagh for all the feedback and guidance on the AI Whitepaper.   Your understanding of customers and how to present technical information to allay any concerns is both incredible and invaluable.  All the quick calls to hash out ideas and agree on the right approach really helped to  shape the document.  You are always very generous with your limited time and I always come away a little wiser and better prepared, thank you!\n\n14#Many Hands|As the saying goes \"Many hands make light work\" but if you combine that with the idiom \"Another pair of eyes\" not only do you get this unnerving AI image but you also get excellent teamwork. TPRM's are becoming more frequent, RFP's are getting bigger and more in depth so it is a great comfort to know that you folks are there, ready to lend a hand to lend a hand when needed to ensure we can keep our customers happy!\n\n15#Showing up for MSFT|Team—you all showed up with your best selves for our marathon presentation to the Microsoft team. I'm writing this message right from the Teams call, capturing the moment as it happens.  I've very impressed at the easy way this team has come together and collaborated to put Workhuman's best foot forward for one of the biggest brands in the world. The meeting is still going, but I wanted to share what was happening now.  The conversations—verbally & via chat—are free flowing, the mood is light and the audience are engaged, impressed—and having fun!  Well done, team! 👏🏽\n\n16#New Customer Alert: Welcome USB!|Big congratulations to Dawn and the entire Workhuman team for winning USB! Like any major sales deal, we faced unique prospect requests, challenges, and a few last-minute twists. But thanks to the team’s dedication, hard work, and strong rapport with the USB leaders, persistence paid off. This account has been worked on feverishly since the first meeting in Q3 2023. WH became a finalist in USB’s RFP process in Q4 2024, presented finalist pitch in Q1 2025, and officially became their VOC in Q1 2025. It became clear their previous vendor, Augeo, struggled to connect business results to outcomes—and the USB team was ready to elevate their employee experience. USB pushed us to be great, and we delivered. We responded by developing a custom employee survey to ensure every voice is heard, and partnered with Submittable, an all-in-one award management platform, to help centralize recognition efforts and run seamless internal competitions. These solutions showcased our commitment to innovation, excellence, and Recognition Done Right. Additionally, our incredible team doubled down on what mattered most—delivering a clear understanding of success metrics, creating a frictionless employee experience, and empowering moments of authentic recognition. From seamless workflows to a culture of gratitude, we proved we could be the strategic, innovative, and experienced partner USB was looking for. We’re thrilled to welcome USB, with 80,000 employees in the banking and finance industry, to the Workhuman community—and we’re proud to see them quickly become champions of our mission. A huge shoutout to the extended Workhuman team who made this possible. Leading the charge was Dawn O’Brien, whose leadership, work ethic, and relationship-building were critical to our success. Thank you all for your incredible contributions—and CONGRATULATIONS on a huge win!  Recognition Done Right isn’t just a slogan. It’s what we do!\n\n17#KLA AI, WHIQ and Inclusion Advisor|Thank you all for coming together through internal meetings, client meetings, slack, emails etc. to get KLA the information their legal team requested when it comes to AI, WHIQ and Inclusion Advisor.  We were able to complete the AI and Mobile Assessments quickly & before the client meeting plus follow up with the additional requested documentation after the client meeting.  I appreciate all the work everyone did and soon we should be able to launch the Culture Hub and Inclusion Advisor!!  Thanks again!\n\n18#Lessons Learned Review|Hi folks -  thanks for taking part and contributing to our Lessons Learned review for Q1! A vital part of our best practices and an important component of our compliance requirements! I think this was the quickest review we've ever done -  only one session!\n\n19#Liam closes Grünenthal for 1 million Euros|I am so delighted to share that Liam has closed his first deal at Workhuman with Grünenthal, a German pharma organisation for a very cool €1 million euros.   Liam created a masterpiece here. Grünenthal was one of the first calls he took at WH where he discovered the team were working to get sign off on a recognition initiative. Liam leapt into action and was all over key stakeholders ensuring he added value in every interaction  - he even reached out to the CEO with a  tailored message and got a good response back. In fact , our main sponsor told us that Liam's email to the CEO still gets talked about positively :-). Using all our support and data  that Liam had  equipped them with, the team got approval and launched the RFP with our template. Liam fully owned every step which resulted in them choosing us. When the contract came in today, this is the note he received “Your continuous advice and guidance has been pivotal for this agreement\"  The multi-threading, persistence, focus on value, coaching and guidance Liam did throughout this sales cycle was spectacular and is a great example of how to build trusted partnerships.    As always, there are many who helped  enable this outcome. Firstly,  the EMEA AE team played a part in winning the deal. Bas met with them back in 2023, Pedro helped  prep for the demo, James supported the RFP pitch, Joe coached Liam around the German market,  Alex shared content from his RFPs  and Joanna answered a great many questions. Our wonderful BDRs  also played a role with Kyle and Emma both engaging them at  Gartner and  Forum.   Michael gave incredible support – he was diligent, patient and an integral partner as were Joe, Christie and Hillary. Jose, Clare and Orlagh supported the RFP presentation  with Liam and James and the CHRO gave glowing feedback.  Finally, a big thank you to Adrian who helped to connect them with others  around Workcouncil approvals.   Such an impressive first win Liam.\n\n20#A Capita Close for James|Wonderful James has closed Capita for 500k. This is a tremendous win as Capita are a large UK business services organisation with  34,000 employees.  This is just the start for them as they are looking to increase budget significantly next year but this is what they could start with now which James managed to win for WH.   This deal originated from a key coach (Head of Employee Engagement & Internal Communications) within Capita, attending last years’ WH London Forum in June. She was so impressed by what she learned that she was willing to provide incredible insights and support in navigating a very complex organisation. Within a few weeks of the Forum, she’d pulled together an internal Capita team of senior leaders to engage with us. The RFP was incredibly competitive with many low-cost vendors participating but James consistently differentiated WH and the trusted partnerships he created set him apart as a credible guide.   When we were trying to show our incredible creativity, Lisa Cripps, Kevin Fischer and Brian Moore provided outstanding support to show our solution in powerful and creative ways. And the powerhouse that is our proposal writing team (both Michael Robb and Mark Simon), produced a masterful RFP response that ensured we were head and shoulders above our competitors right from the start. The DPA review was intense and the contract negotiations time pressured and Orlagh Lynch, Sheila King, Dan Oxenkrug, all provided first-class support. Huge thanks also goes to Chuck and Judy  in Finance for their support  with the negotiations. A final thanks is definitely owed to Clare Moncrieff, Lynette Silva and of course Marc, for the outstanding work they did parallel to the contract negotiations, where Marcy and team started to coach and guide Capita’s R&R project team on early programme design concepts and decisions – a huge help in getting us off to a fast and strong start upon signature.   Huge congratulations James and team.\n\n21#Crushing his annual goal with Lloyds Bank...|I am THRILLED to share that Alex has closed Lloyds for $7,280,000.  To say this has been a labour of love would be an understatement, and Alex has demonstrated incredible determination to get this over the line.   3 years ago Alex gave himself a goal of getting a British bank to join Workhuman. As he began this endeavour, he got objection after objection, but he held steady in his pursuit and chipped away, helping them to think differently about recognition and why their existing  provider (Achievers) was not having the impact they needed for their business.    At this point, he has met so many people at Lloyds, he could work for the bank (please don’t :-)). I remember last Summer he attended an event  to introduce himself to a senior exec and managed to get key information as they ended up commuting home together.  Naomi also wowed  the Lloyds team in various leadership sessions offering  a calm, knowledgeable and very charismatic addition.   The jigsaw pieces finally fell into place as they decided to  launch an RFP.  Lisa, Brian and Nuvs were instrumental in creating a powerful custom demo and Nuvs commitment to ensuring the demo was smooth was incredible.    Michael was key to ensuring we nailed the RFP before our 3-hour finalist pitch which Tom L,  Jose, Orlagh joined to showcase our abilities beautifully.  A HUGE thank you to Tom L who joined the presentation at 4am on Thanksgiving  delivering a masterful presentation which was the icing on the cake for Lloyds.   Once we got VOC, the contracting process  tested the team  but Hillary, Adam and Nick have consistently partnered to ensure we could move forward – thank you  for all the hours of work I know have gone into this.  Finally, thank you to Chris, Chuck and Tom V!  Alex – this is a tremendous win. Its our first win with a UK  bank,  an Achievers take away  and it’s a glorious example of what can be done with the right mindset and determination.   Hats of to you Alex.\n\n22#It takes a Village!|A HUGE thank you to this Incredible team for everyone's focus and help in putting our very best foot forward at every step of R-R's process (so far). We're still on our journey with R-R and doing everything possible to earn their business, but so much outstanding work has been done by our team over the past few months that I wanted to recognise your collaboration, dedication and creativity. A special call-out to Mark Simon for an outstanding RFP proposal, to the Finalist Presentation team (nuvs for being as cool as a cucumber when the tech wasn't behaving!), to Sinead, Clare & Emily for investing so much time in our Derby visit to learn about R-R's culture, history and Apprentice programme, to Maureen for your creative genius with various decks, and to Lisa, Jim and team on scripts and videos! So much care and urgency from everyone involved in trying to win R-R's business. Here's to continuing to impress R-R at every twist and turn on our continuing journey with them - THANK YOU All!\n\n23#Customer sales support|Thank you so much, team for the high-quality work done in support of the Rolls-Royce opportunity. We all work in sales to some degree, and we proved it this week. Thank you for helping. Solve the question about API for data load, and a top quality spec in a day.\n\n24#Welcome Humana, our newest customer!!|Huge congratulations to Aaron and the team for a significant win at Humana!  Like many of our sales pursuits, there were many twists and turns along the way but through the hard work and effort of our team, we persevered and won the hearts and minds of Humana.  While we’ve been engaged with this company for many years building relationships and influencing their thinking around “Recognition Done Right”,  the formal sales process commenced mid-2024 with an RFP.  Primary competitors included Achievers, OC Tanner and Awardco.  What became evident is that WH was the only partner that can deliver the world class program that Humana demands.  AwardCo had their (brief) moment, but we doubled down and challenged their perspective, reminding them that expertise and experience trumped pricing and empty promises.  This elevated our executive alignment and differentiated our product and partnership.  Humana heard loud and clear how Recognition Done Right was the only path forward and they enthusiastically joined our force for good!!  Welcoming Humana to the family adds an additional 67,000 users to our platform and increases our footprint in the health insurance and managed healthcare industry.   While Aaron did a masterful job as the quarterback of the sale, the win would not have been possible without the support and guidance from: Michael Robb, Omar Pradhan, Meisha-Ann Martin, Grant Beckett, Marcy Ricci, Jen Reimert, Eliza Goehry, Tom Libretto, Christie Hynds, Hillary Mahoney, Chris O’Sullivan, Chuck Labovitz, Orlagh Lynch, Aidan McGowran, Adam Basilio, Shane Heelan and Megan Finnerty.           A hearty thank you and congratulations to all involved!!\n\n25#Responding to questionnaires|Dermot, Orlagh, I would like to thank you both for time and work that went into 2 similar surveys/questionnaires that were required by bp in recent weeks. The amount of work involved in completing 1 is significant so when 2 arrive that require your time and attention, it takes time. Thank you for your urgency, your support of your colleagues and most importantly the support for our customers. We appreciate you.\n\n26#Sharing with Data Platform team|Thank you Orlagh for taking the time out of your busy day to spend some time with the Data Platform team. It was great hear more about what the InfoSec team does and learn more about how our team can work with yours to improve our information security. I think we all learned something new (I certainly did) - thank you!\n\n27#One Central Plaza|Thank you all for the fantastic support, guidance and expertise on the OCP Project and playing key roles in ensuring that we had everything above board so that we could open on time. This was a tight turnaround and your swift action made it all possible. It is a pleasure to work with you all.\n\n28#Team Grünenthal|Writing this from the sofa lay down having had my first RFP experience . . !  A huge thank you to Emily and Michael who guided me through creating and submitting a response I was proud of - and then to the presentation team who supported me today in bring that to life.  The level of client engagement was immense - and both the blend of expertise and the way everybody pulls together in these important moments was really something.  Loved it!\n\n29#Reflections on reflections|Orlagh -  thanks for the reminders and prompts on compelteing the reflections -  as much as its tempting to role one's eyes at the task - it's a reminder of all the good work that gets done (and the good work that still needs to get done) over the (half) year  as well as the \"it takes a village\" approach that is necessarry to get it all done.\n\n30#Onward and upward with Lloyd's Bank!|Team - congratulations on receiving \"vendor of choice\" at Lloyd's Bank!  While we still have work to do before we can officially welcome them to the Workhuman family, it's no small feat to be selected as their next global recognition provider.  Their evaluation process was intense and required participation from each of you along the journey to ensure we were positioning Workhuman for success.  After a detailed analysis, they came to the conclusion that we were truly the only option!  As a matter of fact, when they shared the great news, they followed it up by saying our team was the most collaborative team they've worked with in years helping to make their decision easy!  And the best part, this will be another Achievers takeaway!  Well done to all of you for getting us to this point!  Great work!\n\n31#Security for OCP|Thank you all for your time and effort creating the new training for OCP Members, for coordinating back and forth on the detail and having this ready in the nick of time - giving us all an extra piece of mind, before we issue the membership licenses! Much appreciated!!\n\n32#Joe closes Signify for $2.5 million|I am thrilled to share that Joe has closed Signify, previously Phillips Lighting – a Dutch headquartered lighting company  for $2.5 million.  Signify has been a story has taken over 3 years to get to this point. It began with engagement from the Global Head of Rewards in late 2021 - scheduled by Subh. She was not intimately familiar with the recognition platform concept but she quickly identified with our guidance the role that it needed to play in their feedback and performance transformation.  From there, Joe  advocated for and was able to attend their global HR leadership team meeting in July 2022 to build support and buy in for the project. This meeting was supported by Omar, and was a great success - leading into an RFP which ultimately launched in 2023. The team knew that this RFP was written for us, using our template, and we were successful in winning the business. With that said, global restructuring followed shortly afterwards so we had to navigate the next 18 months  and get re-confirmations from the executive management support and budget sign off in late 2024.  This was far from the end though as this was one of the toughest contracting process we have seen. Despite the challenges though, Christie was relentless in her support, and it was possible as a result of our long standing champion in the Head of Reward to maintain key commercial terms: 3 years, no TFC, and a healthy budget!  Thank you  to Matt, Orlagh and Hillary  for all their help and also to Tom and Chris for their support in getting this deal closed.  A huge congratulations to you Joe – you built very senior executive  advocacy, multithreaded across the wider buying group, managed to get in front of the HR Leadership team live (a key component to winning deals 😊) and  owned a very complex contracting process  which was a masterclass from Joe in building healthy tension.  Amazing start to the year - 2025 is the year of acceleration!\n\n33#Solid as a rock|Gaining your perspective has been a valuable learning experience, and I truly appreciate your insights on handling and addressing issues. Thank you!\n\n34#Data Visualisation POC up and running|I want to take a moment to thank you all for your help in getting our data visualization POC up and running with Targetboard and DX. Thanks to you, we made sure we had a secure set up and have established how we would work with the vendors. Some of us will be spending the next few weeks analysing the vendors and coming up with a recommendation, which is a key building block for our goals in becoming a data-driven organisation. Thanks for your input along the way - very excited for what is coming next.\n\n35#Always helping to move the needle with prospects!|Orlagh – I can’t thank you enough for all the support you have been providing to the sales organization.  The end of 2024 and beginning of 2025 have been very busy with prospect facing conversations, security/IT reviews, requirements to fill out questionnaires, and a need to address some very specific questions.  You worked tirelessly during the holiday’s often sacrificing personal time and have gone above and beyond to help us navigate several complex, time sensitive situations.  Your level of knowledge, expertise, and professionalism always shines through, and it builds a tremendous amount of confidence with our prospects.  Thank you so much for your support, we could not do it without you!\n\n36#The Signify case|That was a nice bit of a puzzle yesterday people. Good learning how prospect Client need to see evidence of our documented processes so as to know we have indeed a system or record of these. I should have known having done ISO many moons ago, but Orlagh to the rescue. Thanks for the assist people, eleventh hour and all. Got there as we always do!\n\n37#Support through 2024!|I want to take the opportunity to thank you all for all that you’ve done to help me and my Team through 2024. Your contributions have been instrumental in resulting so many projects we've worked on and I couldn’t be happier to have you as my fellow colleagues. Have a wonderful holiday season, and I look forward to another great year with you all.\n\n38#Amazing Partnership|Orlagh, As the holiday season approaches, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for everything you’ve done. Your unwavering support has been nothing short of incredible. Collaborating with you to overcome challenges and secure read access for the team has truly been a game-changer for SLA.  Your continuous support throughout the year, your willingness to listen, and your fantastic sense of humor that lights up my day has been invaluable. You consistently go above and beyond to help the team navigate every challenge, and it’s something I deeply admire.  Thank you for being such an amazing partner. I’m genuinely excited to continue working together\n\n39#2024 End of Year Wrap-Up - Thank You!!!|Infosec Team,  As we near the end of a busy and eventful 2024, I wanted to take a moment to reflect and thank each and every one of you for your unwavering support and assistance throughout this past year on behalf of the entire customer service leadership team.  It is no surprise that our department is one of Workhuman's biggest and busiest. With thousands of weekly end-user contacts, vendor/partner communications, and client/customer outreach, we rely heavily on the guidance of Infosec to ensure that we are living up to Workhuman's strict data protection standards to the benefit of our customers/end-users. This would not be possible without your help.  Your willingness to consistently go above and beyond to assist our wider team and jump into action to help solve even the most complex of queries is very much appreciated. It goes without saying that the efficiency of our department would not be possible without your team's contributions.  So again, thank you all for your help throughout this past year. Here's to another year of cross-functional partnership, collaboration, and innovation!\n\n40#🌟 An Incredible Mentor and Friend|Dear Orlagh, As the year comes to a close, I want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to you for being an exceptional mentor and guide throughout this year.  Your compassionate yet determined leadership style has been truly inspiring. The world needs more leaders like you—those who lead with both heart and vision.  Thank you for extending your support and nurturing my leadership journey with your wisdom and guidance. Having a mentor at work is a blessing, but I consider myself even luckier to have found both a mentor and a great friend in you.  I’m endlessly thankful for your care, encouragement, and can-do attitude. Wishing you and your family a joyful and relaxing holiday season!  #Mentorship #Leadership #HolidaySeason\n\n41#LBG RFP ASAP|A huge thank you to this team for rallying when we got a very last minute invitation and agenda for the Lloyds RFP presentation. We had just a few days to prepare for a 3 hour session with many different elements to be covered, but thanks to your efforts we delivered an engaging, tailored presentation which prompted lots of questions from the LBG team. Due to restrictions on the number of attendees from Workhuman we each had to wear a few different hats but it was a seamless display from the team. I believe that we are now in a great position to win this deal and it is largely down to your efforts. Special mention to Tom Libretto for the 4am start on Thanksgiving!\n\n42#Top 5 Best Hospital in Massachusetts!|Upon the official signing the Executive Sponsor (Laura Flynn) said \"Terrific news. Thank you, all. I’m excited to get this project underway and to get Workhuman in place for our caregivers. It will have a truly meaningful impact on their experience here at UMass Memorial.\"  What makes this more special is I know so many of our Framingham colleagues have probably been touched by a UMass caregiver experience, now through our work we get to continue to support their tremendous work in our own communities.  22 people and probably more came together to give the UMass team the best buying experience possible and many more will carry the baton to ensure they have an equally memorable client experience.  This journey started back in 2015, selected another vendor in 2016 on price, attended WHL in 2019, came to us in 2019 and we walked away because they wouldn't engage outside of price. In 2021 they came back to us because their program was failing and they wanted to switch, but we consulted them on how to make sure they were getting the very best from the current provider and if after that they couldn't then we were here (something they appreciated and created a high level of trust), and finally they came back to us in Dec 2023 to say they were shutting their old program down and need the reboot to be a success.   There are too many folks to call out specifically, but thank you to each of you for your teamwork and dedication to our clients - each of your efforts contributed in a meaningful way to getting us here.    A special shout out to Marcy Ricci, my ride or die partner in crime, on our first new client logo on the reunion tour. And while he's not here anymore a special shout out to Mike Cassidy (aka Blue Steel) on our final swan song together.\n\n43#Joe closes Allianz Life  for $1.2 million|Please join me in congratulating Joe for another win with Allianz as Allianz Life join Workhuman. There is a brilliant story here as Life transition from Achievers to us. This opportunity originally came from a  meeting with the wider business group as a whole and the Life OE soon began to share with Joe some of their key pain points with Achievers: a lack of reporting and analytics alongside limited customer success. Once consensus had been reached about the need to move to Workhuman, the challenge was building confidence in how we would manage the change and support them from transitioning from a current broken state today to a future  state with WH and recognition done right.   Joe challenged their status quo masterfully and took complete control of the sales process acting as their guide and trusted expert across the entire buying journey.    A few thank you's for those that helped enable with win. Firstly, Lynette was invaluable  through her work with Allianz Tech and  her support with Life's transition plan from Achievers. Adrian   has also created a very strong relationship with Allianz Tech since their  launch  which means they are internal advocates for Workhuman.  Finally, Naomi, as always, excelled in a  problem solving session with the group, creating  confidence around  what our change process could look like.   A big thank you also to  Chris, Chuck, Orlagh, Hillary and Christie who each played a key role in their  unique contracting process. Beautiful team work.   Congratulations Joe on this magnificent win.\n\n44#Nov Director+ meeting|To this wonderful group of speakers - thank you for the time, energy and insight delivered during the Nov Director+ meeting. This group was pulled together to ensure our leaders understood critical business information and milestones as we head into a very busy season for Workhuman. I know this is extra effort outside your day jobs and I appreciate the effort you put into the slides, pre-meetings and practice to ensure our leaders got the info they needed to be successful!\n\n45#Security Quiz|Thank you both for your help with running the security quiz in the canteen during October Cyber Security Awareness month - it was a fun event with some fantastic engagement  and there is no way it could have happened without your help!\n\n46#Outstanding partner|Orlagh - I want to express my gratitude for all the support you've given my team. Your efforts have significantly enhanced our efficiency and skills, leading to a much-improved customer experience with faster resolution times, your consistent help has been invaluable. Thank you.\n\n47#Dream Team|Team,  I am so grateful and proud of this team.  It takes a village but the past week has been nothing short of incredible.  Each of you have played an integral part of making 3 finalist presentations deliver an amazing experience for our possible future clients.   Michael and Orlagh - you dove in with an unexpected last minute infosec questionnaire with very little turnaround time at Entergy Amanda, Brian, and Amy - you built custom global slides, video slides, custom demo sites, posterboards and slides of custom collaterals and much more Mike, Matt, Joyce, Marcy, Eliza, Phil, Joyce, and Omar - you have been part of countless prep sessions, presenting in 3 finalist pitches in a 24 hour period, and adding so much depth to the demos and presentations.  Each of your ideas and contributions made the meetings a success.   Thank you, thank you, thank you.   We showed up well for each presentation because of each of you.\n\n48#Policy, compliance, systems and data!|Thank you to this group who have been involved in an overhaul of our recruitment policy and followed through with partnering with marketing on acceptance of updated terms as well as HRIS on cleansing data and pulling the report required for this request on the updated policy.  The changes to the policy will make a positive impact and really appreciate everyone time, effort, resilience and persistence in getting this done. It wasn't quite a clear path, but we got there!\n\n49#Spark Leadership Guest Panelists|Thank you so much to today's Spark Leadership Graduation guest panelists who created an incredible in-person experience in both offices for our 30 attendees. Thank you for preparing thoughtful responses to our people leader's questions and answering questions in the session as well!\n\n50#Importance of PII Guidelines|Thank you Orlagh & Sheila for continued support to develop guidelines on handling PII data. Given the competing priorities you both have, you have recognised how key it is to set such guidelines, and I really appreciate that. The guidelines will serve as a critical foundation to ensure that the processing of PII is done in a responsible and secure manner for all data stored on Workhuman systems. Your collaboration toward achieving this goal has been invaluable. I look forward collaborating with you both to drive our data security principles and guidelines.\n\n51#CDK crossed the Q3 finish line!|Twas the end of July and Mark Morrison was really still getting started in his Workhuman career journey when we received a meeting request from the CDK team through BDR extrordinairre Nicole Ross. Mark leaped at the opportunity to take part in the process. Now CDK had already shown interest in Workhuman in the past so we were able to look through the account notes and even speak with Maggie Daley directly who had been very involved in CDK's first inquiry into Workhuman over a year ago. We ended up losing the CDK deal to Achiever's at that time (insert boos here!). In our first demo/meeting, Maggie picked up right where she left off not missing a beat. This allowed us to uncover a sense of urgency on the prospect's side to leave Achiever's when their contract expired (Jan 1) with no gap in their recognition programs. We sailed through the RFP process with the help of the legendary Michael Robb and were eventually selected as the VOC. Mark then took the lead on all calls moving forward. In true point guard fashion, he would pass the ball or shoot when necessary. Even John Stockton would have been impressed! Things were going well until we ran into our final hurdle... the Final Boss....that sneaky thief.... TIME!  We needed to get this closed and client signatures before October in order to ensure a smooth January launch. The urgency fire was present on all sides but we had a few days of back and forth with their technical and legal teams that kept pushing the close back. This is where Julia, Hillary, and Orlagh were able to help us put some of their final concerns at ease through emails and even a zoom with the client! And in the final hour, on Monday 9/30 Mark was able to secure the signatures and close this deal for $500,000. This is Mark's very first deal here at Workhuman and it wouldn't have been possible without this amazing team effort!   Please join me in congratulating Mark Morrison and the entire team on a buzzer beating Q3 win here!!\n\n52#MillerKnoll Marathon for the Win!|MillerKnoll is officially WON! This $2.050M YOS and Celebrations program has provided lessons learned and is a testament to the team’s resilience in the face of adversity and delays. 15 months and 26 Workhuman Team Members running this Marathon, Brandon Warner was the pace setter, and he couldn’t have done this without this team, who rallied and shared the same tenacious spirit. The MillerKnoll journey began with Lisa Landon, whose positive impact on a contact from another company, created the spark that ignited this opportunity. Then the departure of key contacts at MillerKnoll posed significant challenges, requiring Brandon to re-establish new executive relationships from scratch. Many thanks to Connor for his partnership in prospecting new contacts! Maggie and Naomi provided the type of consultancy that was second to none on this journey. Jillian Petro made sure the 1:1 ABM support was flawless, noting that this is her first ABM win for Corporate Sales. Thank you to Chris and Owen for a brilliantly crafted mood video and to Brian for a fantastic custom demo site. Jess Klay also joined a leg of this run pulling fabrics utilized in our new offices with a MillerKnoll brand attached to it.  As most marathon’s go, there is a runner’s high and with the relationships re-established, Jeff, Anne and Brenda helped pull out the stops for us at WHL.  Q2 Finish Line steps away... the CFO required a market assessment for pricing, leading to a \"light\" RFP. Our RFP team, Michael and Anna guided us along with our Finance Team Chuck and Chris to facilitate price modeling and of course Tom & Jen to strategize! Our E-Comm team was integral in positioning various needs; many thanks to Mindi and Audrey.  This Marathon wasn't complete without Legal and our IT Teams! In this case the one document causing the bumps in our road was the DPA. Of course, Orlagh, Nuvs and Matt in partnership with Christy Hillary, Dan and Nick got us to the finish line!\n\n53#Dream team|I know I don't do this as often as I should to but I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you. Your continuous support, patience, and willingness to teach and help me out have been invaluable.  Your dedication to sharing your knowledge and guiding me through challenges has made a significant impact on my growth and confidence. I truly appreciate each one of you for always being there and going above and beyond to assist me.  Thank you for being such an amazing team!\n\n54#Differentiating Excellence!|A HUGE thank you to each of you for all the work invested in preparing for and delivering a very strong performance to BAT. We had just a few days to prepare for this RFP presentation and everyone stepped up - schedules moved, travel plans adjusted and energy levels raised. Given we were the first vendor to present, it was critical to make a strong impression and we went very hard on our differentiators. I especially loved Naomi's reminder to their senior stakeholder that he shouldn't confuse us with any of the other vendors they'd be evaluating and made it clear exactly why - perfectly delivered! Thank you to each of you for making BAT feel like they were THE most important client - we definitely put our best foot forward and I'm looking forward to the next step.\n\n55#Thank you InfoSec Team|On this World Gratitude Day, I want to extend our heartfelt thanks for your incredible hard work and dedication throughout the year. Your commitment to excellence and your flexibility in accepting process changes have been crucial to our success. The Procurement Team is truly grateful for your unwavering support and collaboration. Your expertise and efforts have made a significant difference, and we appreciate everything you do.\n\n56#Thank you!|Dear Infosec team members,  On World Gratitude Day, I just wanted to thank you for everything you do to keep Workhuman's data safe and secure. Working with you on clients' security assessments, I get more insight than most into the great efforts the Infosec team undertakes to keep our data (as we Yanks say) locked down like Ft. Knox and our users' privacy assured. Whether its regular ISO audits, remediating the latest vulnerability findings and zero-day threats, or introducing our new DLP / data classification solution, you are the keystone team behind Workhuman's success. Because after all, our data is our gold, and it's good to know we have the best and brightest minding the shop!\n\n57#Quick response for application|Thank you both for the speedy turnaround review and comments related to our cyber liability insurance application.  This quick response ensures we have an accurate application that highlights our strong security infrastructure and gives us extra time to work with our advisor to obtain updated coverage with the best insurer(s).\n\n58#Wella, Wella, Wella ....|I am thrilled to share that Joanna has closed Wella for $750,000k.  For those that don’t know Wella, they are a beauty company and are behind the very  loved GHD, O.P.I. and Clairol brands 😊   This sales cycle started last September at Gartner Re-Imagine where Joanna engaged their Global Head of Reward. When his team shared with him late last year that they were looking at recognition providers, he immediately suggested talking with us and the rest is history 😊   Joanna has led this deal superbly offering prescriptive  guidance to the Wella team  throughout and building advocacy across an organisation which is implementing a recognition program for the first time.   As always, there are many players to thank. Firstly, to Maggie for her support with Spend Management, Value Creation and Investment Modelling, and to Ralph for bringing it all together into a business case. Lynette kindly shared a detailed kick-off agenda to incorporate supporting their recognition policy conversations and the ever creative Lisa made some exceptional mock-ups for us to use with the Wella team.   Thanks also to Emily S, Dan and Hillary for teaming up and supporting on the legal side,  to Chris, Chuck and Tom V for helping us to navigate payment terms and to Orlagh, Enda and Matt who provided incredible technical support regarding SuccessFactors integration. Finally, thank you also to Lynsey McGee for her swift response to help create us as a vendor on their system (SAP)  A wonderful win Joanna - many congratulations.\n\n59#Designing Service & Support Future|Thank you for your outstanding dedication and engagement over the last 2 days. Each of you brought unique perspective, experience and insight into the workshop. Thanks to you, we have a strong foundation for building the maturity of our service and support capability over 2025.\n\n60#Novo going to give you up|Team, I want to thank you all for your significant contributions to the Novo Nordisk RFP presentation and demo. The request from Novo was to bring their vision to life with a concise, strategic presentation and it was inspiring to see each of you deliver your sections with impact and precision.   The demo from Marcy and nuvs in particular was hugely engaging and Joyce, Meisha-Ann and Eliza did a fantastic job of articulating how Workhuman is uniquely positioned to support Novo's global recognition initiative. Rich S, John, Emily and Orlagh responded to the Novo team Q&A with authority and efficiency. And our custom demo environment was expertly (and speedily!) crafted by Brian Moore - the look and feel got a nod of appreciation from the Novo team.  This was yet another occasion where I felt very proud to work alongside such a great bunch of humans - thank you for your support!\n\n61#Late night SSO reviews for Harman|Thank you Orlagh and Stephanie for the last minute review of the SSO flows for Harman. This project has had some flaws in execution, so it was necessary to bring you both in to help bring some sense and stability to what we are going to deliver. Thank you both for helping get us to a clearer understanding, and at short notice too.\n\n62#Respect for Quality|Guys, I need to take a moment between all the work with the recent issue called Hotels.com , to appreciate how the collaboration in all fronts in our side, is really outstanding. Thanks for the continued work and for doing all efforts in order to support the supplier and our stakeholders dealing with it in the best and quickest way. I hope this will close out soon. Thanks for all dedication.\n\n63#Trust us, we are winning at Wintrust!|Congratulations, Laura, and team, on the $640,000 win at Wintrust! A win that was not for the faint of heart for all involved! Five years in the making, with the last 2 under Laura’s guidance has paid off as she successfully brought this opportunity over the finish line. This deal required a combination of tenacity and patience, and Laura struck just the right balance. Starting with an E-Thanks only request to a fully funded R&R program. We conducted over 35 meetings and had 19 consulting engagements throughout the process. It truly took a village, starting with our Strategic Advisory Team.  A big thank you to Marcy, who positioned Workhuman in the initial finalist presentation, and to Maggie, who provided invaluable insight, thought leadership, and guidance to the Wintrust team. Jen ensured that key points were highlighted during the Gallup Roundtable, creating a catalyst for funding a recognition program. Of course no opportunity is complete without a supporting actor in the mix and that is none other than Michael Robb.  He was always at the ready to assist with responses to the many one off questions that came up during negotiations and contracting!   Navigating the contracts and IT risk hurdles posed by Wintrust’s IT Risk Team was no small feat. With Orlagh and Matt’s guidance, along with Nuvs, we overcame their meticulous scrutiny. Orlagh’s unwavering confidence and grace aligned us seamlessly. And our legal team!! They not only expertly handled contract nuances but also managed to turn even the grumpiest attorneys into a Workhuman fan. Hillary even coaxed a smile out of their counsel! Kudos to Hillary and Emily for their diligence and patience in finalizing this contract.\n\n64#The art of the possible with HSBC|The 'dream team' assembled last week to deliver an impactful, thought provoking and most of all, EXCELLENT RFI presentation to HSBC. I could not be more grateful for your partnership on this very exciting opportunity and the smiles and nods from the HSBC team throughout the presentation indicate that we consistently hit the mark with our insight. Special mention to nuvs and Marcy for the slick, comprehensive and energising demo run which truly demonstrated the 'art of the possible'!\n\n65#Deloitte Security Review|Thanks for all you did in preparation for the recent Board Meeting, from kicking off and managing a full independent security review with a brand new vendor to collating and prepping the slideware. That’s not to mention everything you do every day to ensure our results are so favourable in the first place! Awesome job, Thanks!\n\n66#100 Staples Project Collaboration|Thank you to each and every human that contributed to the success of the 100 Staples Project. This build epitomizes our value of Teamwork, a culmination of extensive global collaboration. Thousands of decisions were made throughout the entire process with meticulous care to ensure an outstanding experience for our humans. From cutting-edge technology and sound systems to biophilic design and wellbeing amenities—including our cherished Gratitude Tree—every aspect reflects our dedication. I extend heartfelt thanks to every individual whose unwavering dedication brought this vision to life!\n\n67#Lead By Example!!|Orlagh, your leadership shines through in granting us the space to align with policy without compromising our customer commitments. Your approval reflects not only trust in our abilities but also a profound understanding of the delicate balance between compliance and delivery. Your support empowers us to excel and adapt with confidence.\n\n68#Anti-Tailgating Measures|I would like to recognise facilities and reception for implementing some recent anti-tailgating measures. Orla & Dermot I believe you were instrumental in arranging with ParkWest maintenance a schedule that is likely to align with receptionist hours. And you worked with Yvonne from facilities to get the newly added sign- a good sign - which succinctly instructs visitors on what to do in the case where our receptionist is out.  Special thanks to Dermot for hopping on two 30 minute long phone calls with me and working through all the risks involved with unauthorised access to our buildings and the costs involved in preventing such access. I really enjoyed the conversations and I felt we both broadened each other's perspectives. In particular, I now have a greater appreciation that the risk involved may not be as severe as I imagined when I originally reported this issue to Infosec.\n\n69#Answering the call|Orlagh and Matt, Thank you for both for making yourselves available to handle a very critical call with Wintrust today.  It was well into the evening for you Orlagh but without you that call wouldn't have gone nearly as smooth.  From the work ahead of time that you put in with the IT White Paper (which their team referenced as Best in Class) to how you seamlessly handled their questions and put their worries at ease.  You're calm confidence in our solution was noted by our main contact multiple times.  Matt, you came ready to handle their questions on integrations and added to their delight when they found out the new response was even better then the last.  I appreciate how both of you handled the call and made it a priority.  Thank you!!\n\n70#Presenter Extraordinaire|Thank you for presenting at this month's all hands finance and legal meeting.  I greatly appreciate you taking time from your hectic schedule to prepare and then present to the group.  Your presentation was on point and conveyed great information to the team.\n\n71#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders.

Cheers to the entire team behind WorkhumanLive Austin!\n\n72#Great meeting with ATS DPO|Thank you both for your great work on today's meeting with ATS and their Data Privacy Officers. This is a critical step in moving forward with the expansion. We opened with questions around consent, data privacy, retention, etc. and I think it was great, Orlagh, that you gave them a few options and things to think about. Christopher then moved to the demo and focused on the areas of primary concern. You expertly guided them through the system and at the end of the meeting they said the system is easy to use, and they have no concerns. They have a little homework on their side for some legalese, and communications, but today was a HUGE step forward. Thank you for your time and expertise.\n\n73#Fireside Chat Stars..!|Orlagh & Martina - I wanted to recognize your generosity, bravery and leadership in supporting yesterday's D&A COP and Women and Allies jointly-hosted Fireside chat yesterday.   Together you crafted an unmissable session that garnered attendance from across the company - perhaps one of the largest ever attendances in recent times for one of these sessions.   Thank you Orlagh your support and above all for your willingness to share openly about your work and professional journey to this point of your career. Thanks Martina for your deft management of the conversation and for making sure we got to hear Orlagh's message loud and clear.  What an amazing session!\n\n74#James closes Aptiv for $2 million....|Aptiv has more than 200,000 employees globally and is an automotive technology supplier. Their starting point is a global recognition programme for their 25,000 online employees and we have every intention of growing this over time.   Aptiv was just over a year in the making and the deal team involved in helping to win them has been extensive. Naomi was very involved from the outset, leading multiple engaging workshops with a range of senior Aptiv stakeholders – she seriously impressed and helped put us in pole position during Aptiv’s extensive RFP process. Meghan Honan leveraged her deep knowledge of our client base to propose some rock solid customer references. Orlagh Lynch, Brian Moore, Kevin Fischer, Lisa Cripps, Mark Simon and Michael Robb all worked their magic on our RFP response and helped ensure that Aptiv was never in any doubt as to our unique differentiators and how to set us apart from all the wannabes – Aptiv loved the branded demo site that Brian & Kevin created for them! The finalist onsite presentation involved Rich Sorrentino, Michael Smith, Rahul Srinivasan, Naomi Dishington and Tom V – Aptiv’s CPO, Obed, was very impressed by the presentation and shortly afterwards met up with Eric Mosley for dinner and a discussion – thank you  Eric!   With  tight launch goal ambitions, we convinced Aptiv to use our contract docs and Julia Towle did a masterful job of getting them in-line with our requirements in what was close to record time. Commercial negotiations with Procurement required an onsite meeting in Dublin and Steve C and Tom V gave a masterclass in how to negotiate with a very tough procurement team. A huge thanks to all of those involved in this win.  James - once again you deliver on your forecast and you a role model of what great sales execution looks like. Your laser focus day in and day out, sharp  business acumen, deep product expertise and endless charm is just a magic combination. YOU ARE GOLD.\n\n75#An Electrifying Win With ESO|Congratulations to James McNeil who has closed his first deal of 2024 with ESO for $635k. ESO is the electricity system operator for the UK and they are all so excited to partner with WH following  National Grid’s very successful recently launched recognition programme. Last week they told us how important it was for them to partner with such a respected recognition vendor :-)   As always, we has to work through  lots of contractual negotiations, which touched on InfoSec and security controls (thank you both Michael Robb and Orlagh as ever on your responsiveness and thoroughness) Thank you also to  Chuck in Finance for your support with the commercial terms, and Rich Sorrentino for engaging with the ESO project team on various programme design queries whilst in parallel we finalised the contract negotiations (incredibly helpful and strategic). Finally, as ever, there was impressive leadership from the Legal team, where they helped to get ESO aligned with the right way to structure the agreement – Christie and Hillary were creative, responsive and collaborative at every twist and turn of the process. A huge thanks to you both, we’re incredibly lucky to have such a strong team!!    A big shout out to you James - your hard work and consistent  determination is always so impressive to watch.\n\n76#Audit Fun!|Thanks for the tireless effort you have put in to the ongoing IBM audit process. It has been an arduous road since last October with a never ending stream of asks and some difficult conversations and individuals to navigate. I applaud your grit and poise in always showing up with your game face and rising to each challenge as they present themselves. We will prevail Thanks to your determination and Customer centric attitude. My Thanks!\n\n77#Smooth On-boarding|Many thanks for your support in on-boarding AWS proserve consultants. Given the short notice and critical nature of the project with tight deadlines, your assistance was crucial. Your efforts, from setting up the consultant in WD to reviewing and granting access to WH resources through the DVI machine, were instrumental in ensuring a smooth and timely onboarding process. Thank you for your support.\n\n78#Let it GROW, let it GROW!|To this amazing cross-functional team, I am filled with profound gratitude as I extend my sincerest thanks to each and every one of you for bringing to life the vision of our Gratitude Tree to 100 Staples. Your relentless dedication and collaborative spirit have turned a sprout of an idea into a breathtaking living reality that will resonate with our employees and elevate our new building to unprecedented heights in technology and experience. (All the tree puns intended).   The passion and creativity you have collectively poured into this endeavor are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Your unique contributions to create the kiosk app, the tree displays itself, the motion and the movement, and even those who helped unblock issues and make sure we were safe in all that we were doing, showed unwavering commitment that will not only shape our physical space but also infuse it with the essence of our shared values and traditions. A true masterpiece right in the heart of our Workhuman Central.   I am honored and deeply appreciative of the exceptional work and incredible synergy that has fueled the creation of this unparalleled experience. Thank you for embracing this vision and making it a remarkable reality that will be cherished by all for many years to come.\n\n79#Robot testing and ISO training review|Hi folks,   With Privacy Day behind us and our new ISO training out the door - I wanted to say thank you all - between all of you you either gave the updated Privacy Bot game a once over or contributed to updating the ISO training slides with your eagle eyes and great suggestions!  Many thanks !   best regards, Dermot\n\n80#Allianz joins Workhuman|There are so many reasons to celebrate this  - please join me in congratulating Joseph Moscardini for closing Allianz Technology for $2,1755,400.   Joe deserves this win 100 times over. He demonstrated incredible sales expertise throughout this journey – selling the strategic impact that recognition can have not only to Allianz Technology but to many others OEs at Allianz that we hope to expand to shortly. Joe managed key stakeholders masterfully presenting live in Germany to gain CEO and wider  advocacy. Once convinced , Allianz were blocked  from buying without an RFP and Achievers were sure they would win given they work with parts of Allianz already. However, the advocacy that Joe had built was so huge that they very quickly chose us.    Many thanks you are due here.  Firstly to Subh who scheduled the initial meeting and to Lisa who ran an excellent ABM campaign. The wonderful Rob Schmitter played a key role at the start and led  value/investment modelling sessions with Allianz. When he retired, Omar took over the baton and flew all the way to Germany to partner with Joe during the presentations to build wider buy-in. As did  MAM  who joined the Global offsite and wowed the team with the insights we could offer.  And Lynette has been a critical partner throughout demonstrating how we will  engage their work councils.   The RFP Presentation was helped massively by both Mark and Michael  being wonderful partners and sharing excellent responses as well as Brian and Kevin  for creating an exceptional custom demo.  Orlagh answered their many questionnaires with precision and expertise.   A huge thanks  to Tom V and Tom L who have been excellent partners providing coaching  all the way,  Chris and Chuck who helped us work through the commercials and Hillary and Christie who  built an exceptional partnership with the Allianz legal team.   Congratulations Joe – this is just the tip of the iceberg with Allianz and I cant wait to see how this grows.\n\n81#IBM 2023 Audit Momentous Leadership!|Thank you Abha and Orlagh for your commendable management and oversight of the year-end (2023) IBM privacy and security audit.  I extend my utmost gratitude for completing this enormous and extremely high-visibility project, working with 20+ different team members around the clock, juggling multiple deliverables with aggressive due dates, and accommodating global timelines for a plethora of meetings at the busiest time of year!  Thank you for your commitment to our largest Conversations client, upholding the highest standards of privacy and security during this critical period.  Due to your unwavering professionalism, technical expertise and sense of urgency, you have greatly contributed to the continued success of the IBM partnership.\n\n82#Lightning speed success - $8.5M Win PayPal|What an incredible whirlwind of activities to get to this win with PayPal. Thanks to Sameer for leading the accelerated Close Plan that enabled final signature within a month of creating the opportunity! There are many notable achievements around this deal. First, ensuring ongoing customer excellence. People move from companies that are customers of Workhuman. When they have an amazing experience with the recognition program, they tell others. A top executive at Intuit, a Workhuman customer for nearly two decades, became the CEO at PayPal. When he arrived, he told his team, “We need recognition.” Workhuman was not the only choice, we had competition. This leads to the second notable reason we won; responsiveness and attention to their needs. We were told that “another company didn’t respond or pay much attention to the opportunity,” but Sameer did. Finally, the third reason we won, acting with urgency.  Looking back at my notes, we informed Tom V of this opportunity on Nov. 20.  It wasn’t in the pipeline just over 35 short days ago!  Don’t be fooled, the team had to execute the same selling steps to complete – confirmation and approval of budget, completing the security assessment and numerous vendor questionnaires, passing the vendor onboarding process, demos to the business, procurement, and legal teams, conducting early decision guidance, committing to bi-weekly cadence calls, and negotiating the agreement and legal requirements.  Many thanks to those who assisted in getting this deal done in an expeditious manner with huge shouts outs to Christie Hynds, Nina Reichert, Chuck Labovitz, Chris O’Sullivan, Hillary Mahoney, Doug Fries, Michael Robb, Orlagh Lynch, Rich Sorrentino, Mindi Ennis, Weichen Zhu, Jim Gregoire, Liam Farrell, Nuvs, Nick Solis and Tom V.  We are excited to welcome PayPal to the Workhuman family and partner with one of the world's most recognized brands.\n\n83#Ferguson Win - Flushing the Competition|Please join me in congratulating Mark Bankover on a $5.2M win at Ferguson!  This is a Halo replacement and head-to-head win over Tanner, Achievers and AwardCo.  Ferguson is the largest plumbing supplies distributor in North America, with close to 30k employees.  They play in the same space as Kohler and have a large offline population.  At the onset, this started as an RFP with Ana and Michael supporting the process and setting us up for success, in addition to IT support from both Orlagh and Enda.  We leaned heavily on building relationships at this account, with a special thanks to Meisha-Ann for leveraging her personal relationship with the SVP of TR (the eventual signer).  Of course, the reference with Kohler that Dawn facilitated was critical as was the video Tom L created to demonstrate our executive-level commitment to earning the business.  This is also a WD and Teams shop, so we worked closely with Nuvs, John Trigg and also Jason G (did a demo of the iQ app for us) to differentiate our position, in addition to a solid custom demo (Brian M).  Marcy was a rock star the entire time, helping Ferguson to see what the possibilities could be and how we could help them move to a more strategic program.  The financials of the deal were also somewhat unique, as this is a platform fee arrangement, and we had some lively negotiations with them as this progressed.  Thank you to Chuck, Chris O and Tom V for your support, creativity and direction to help us secure this win.  Hillary and Dan worked diligently alongside sales to navigate the contracting process, which was also nuanced as Ferguson used outside counsel.  And across this broad group of contributors, Mark quarterbacked this deal like a pro, build amazing internal relationships and earned this marquis win.  Congrats to all involved!  Very, very impressive!\n\n84#Gratitude for Exceptional Mentorship!!|Orlagh, your guidance has been instrumental in shaping my skills and character. Gratitude fills me for your wisdom that turned challenges into triumphs and patience that fostered my growth. Your mentorship not only instilled excellence but also compassion, setting a profound example. Your insights on managing large teams with a blend of tactical prowess and strategic foresight remain invaluable.

You all have had such an important role to play in making the IBM audit a success. We will  be getting the report soon but i'm sure all our hard work will be paid off. You all were availabe on a drop of a hat, ready to answer all the questions, get on calls with IBM to explain them our processes better and give them required assurance. This was all very much required to keep 7 auditors at bay!!! PHEW. We were mostly outnumbered but never outperformed in our calls.   Thank you all so much, without you it would'nt have been possible. Its a feat we all achieved coz we worked as a team. A very happy holidays to all. Cheers!\n\n86#Guardian Life - Won at $2.5M!|Excited to Share that Guardian Life was just closed won by Jenn Brauer for $2.5M!  3rd times a charm as there were two previous opportunities attempted in 2014 and 2017!  This time around the Opportunity has been in the making for 2 years with a group of 8 from Guardian Life attending Workhuman Live 2 years in a row, thank you Anne LaFond and Jeff Graham for your support in curating teams packages for multiple years (Can’t wait to welcome their team as a Customer to WHL in 2024!).  There were 5 strategic advisors, integral to this Win, interacting on 21 occasions to facilitate conversations around investment, what good looks like, how to navigate the launch process and change management strategies among many other topics!  Thank you, David Stott, Maggie Daley, Hari Date, Corinne Selk, and Marci Ricci.  Jenn Brauer masterfully took over the conversation and relationship with Guardian when we needed her passion to shine for the RFP demo and get us to VOC. Having a terrific demo customized, no doubt had its impact; Thank you to Brian Moore! Of course, we would have never gotten to a finalist demo without the skills of Anna Chmura and Michael Robb to articulate our solution and differentiators in the RFP response! In the background running campaigns was Larry Dennison from ABM to insure they knew our alignment in Financial Services was strong, Achievers was no match for us, and hit a key driver of theirs with the Unified Culture campaign! None of this would have occurred without the commercial term negotiations via Chuck Labovitz, or the legal and security review, edits, exhibits and clarifying emails from Emily Smith, Hillary Mahoney, and Orlagh Lynch.  Of course, no deal is complete without the strategic support from Tom V!  All throughout, Jenn continuously stayed on top of the requests, the process and social surround needed to win this deal.   Congratulations on making plan Jenn and this Win getting you to a sunny spot in Aruba @ Club!\n\n87#Coming to GE's Rescue!|Thank you, team for such an incredible execution this weekend with GE. Never did any of us expect to be pulled into an urgent situation on a Sunday (morning for some and afternoon for others!) A critical incident had surfaced and we needed to act fast, from an IT, account management, & leadership perspective. In a moment's notice, you all rallied together to research & respond to the matter. Shortly thereafter you all joined a call with GE's program manager & executive sponsor to share our findings and deliver the news that the mistake was not on the Workhuman side. I'm sure you all shared with me the relief of knowing this, given the critical position we have been in with GE lately. Although it would have been better for this not to happen, the good news is that GE was so appreciate and grateful for the responsiveness of each and every one of you. Thank you for your passion and dedication to deliver to this very important customer of 20 years!\n\n88#Real Time Action Takers!|Thank you Ann-Marie for seeing an opportunity to have the conversation on the IT Whitepaper be even more impactful by pinging Orlagh during our All-hands Call so the questions that have been circulating recently can be answered for the broader group.  This action allowed for a cohesive message and eliminate multiple one off conversations on the same topic!  Orlagh - Thank you for taking such quick action to add a slide to your presentation virtually real time while on our All-Hands Call to cover data storage and back up locations!  We appreciate you continuing to provide education, insight and being willing to pivot based on all our questions!\n\n89#MFA Solution Race!|i am sure i am missing people that have helped support this initiative from the early research and investigation standpoint, to the countless touch bases and calls, to the development of actual timelines and product sample demos. just taking a look at some of the behind the scenes product solutioning options this team was able to put together is mind blowing! i sincerely appreciate all the time, effort, and support you have all given to this endeavor. although we are not at the finish line just yet -  today's customer call went the best they have gone and the VP of hr analytics digital team acknowledged their appreciation of the work done so far to get to this point towards a solution that will work best for their organization.  so thank you all!\n\n90#Fidelity in the win column - $6M|Well, this is just about the largest group of colleagues I have awarded recognition too.  But, this is what teamwork is all about...25 people strong (and the list is likely longer) won this opportunity together!!  It took everything we had to unseat BI and secure this new client and close to 80k new employees on the WH platform.    John McCormack - quarterback, leader, therapist and procurement whisperer.

Enjoy!\n\n91#James closes National Grid for $17,390,000|I have the privilege of working alongside James every day, and his success is no surprise. His work ethic, his hunger and can-do attitude, his dedication to getting better, his ability to build trust and credibility, his team approach and his capability of challenging in the most charming way are just some of the ways I see James shine.   James, I hope I say this enough to you – I think you are brilliant, and I feel privileged to work with you.   A stellar team is behind an outcome like this and there are many people to thank.   Michael Robb took the lead on crafting a powerful response to their monster  RFP and pulled in all the various SMEs for their expertise – Orlagh  dealt with NGs complex Infosec requirements, along with Mindi and Amanda who solved some  challenging YOS requirements,  Chuck took  the lead on our fee proposal and Catriona on some thought-provoking tax questions!   During our finalist presentation, NG shared that we were a ray of light after a day of other vendor presentations - Lynette, Weichen & Rich were outstanding, and they were helped by Lisa and Brian who created a powerful demo site.   The contracting process started in June and was led by Julia. She did an amazing job and once she had more important matters to focus on (a baby)  Hillary and Christie jumped in – they had the unusual situation of only ever being allowed to talk to Procurement, but regardless, the amount of effort they invested was incredible and they always found a solution. NG also insisted on us using their paperwork to which they were adverse to changing in any way  which made for some challenging conversations and a huge thanks to Tom L, Tom V, Nick and Chris for their  guidance, and the many meetings we all had to enable today to happen.   It takes a lot of effort from so many people to win a client of this magnitude, THANK YOU all!!   James – we are thrilled for you.\n\n92#Thank you|Thank you for always helping with customers' security requests and the urgent one we had for GE recently. You all always come through for our customers and it's greatly appreciated.\n\n93#Happy World Gratitude Day!!|Orlagh, on this Gratitude Day, I want to express my deepest thanks. Your guidance, wisdom, and unwavering support have been instrumental in my growth. Your proactivity to share knowledge and provide invaluable advice, coupled with your compassion, has shaped my professional journey. I am immensely grateful for your mentorship, which has been a beacon of light. Thank you for your dedication to my development.\n\n94#Positive Planning|Thanks for a fun and productive planning session yesterday. Always great to put our heads together but particularly refreshing to look at how we bolster growth to exciting levels. Thanks for bringing all your positivity and passion to the proceedings.\n\n95#Company wide team work! 🙌🏻|Thank you for taking time to support our team as we build out our new site experience for Workhuman.com. You provided us with guidance in your area of expertise to ensure our site is accurate & helpful for our users. Our website is the face of our company and we truly appreciate the time you dedicated to helping us drive towards a successful site launch! ✨\n\n96#Technical Call Mastery|Orlagh/John - thank you both for the support with todays important technical call with GDIT. Certainly not an easy group with the lack of cameras/interaction, but you both were able to cover all of their topics with ease and in a way that was simple to understand for the group. I’m sure we’ll have plenty more discussions with them over the coming weeks, so this is a great first step to move the needle on a very important q4 deal. Appreciate you both!!\n\n97#Leading us to ISO 27701 success!|Orlagh - A huge thank you for your effort and patience as we prepared for our ISO 27701 certification. Our high standards for privacy are now  recognised  by ISO for all to see! This will be hugely valuable for our business and for our customers.  It took fantastic teamwork and your leadership steered us to success.\n\n98#Joanna Abboud seals the Circet deal - 550k Euros|Our very own Joanna Abboud has welcomed her first customer to the Workhuman family – Circet for 550,000 Euros.  This is a wonderful story as it is one of the first calls Joanna led when she joined Workhuman (with the expert support of Joseph Moscardini)  Circet,  a telecom network service provider, has been suffering with low morale and sadly numerous suicides across the business and are passionate about building a culture of gratitude.  Joanna has demonstrated sales excellence across this short sales cycle – creating key executive relationships, building pain and challenging the business about the cost of status quo. She has been tremendous in taking control – one of the key traits of being a true challenger – and has held her main contact accountable at each stage. So much so,  that he was texting her excitedly at 10.30pm last night to confirm he had signed the contracts on time 😊.  Fabulous work Joanna - I know this is just the beginning for you and it is inspiring to see what you are building in a short space of time.  As always, it is a team effort in getting these deals across the board. Our talented consultants, Rob Schmitter (still very missed) and Maggie were instrumental  in building credibility and took a key role in value creation/investment modelling. With Stuart Curtis's support, MJ met with with Head of HR at a CIPD event in Dublin where they shared our book and Orlagh was fabulous as always in getting our DPA signed off. Last but not least, our legal and finance  partners, Emily, Joe and Chuck  were instrumental in getting this deal signed yesterday.   Congratulations Joanna – Team EMEA is thrilled for you\n\n99#All the security|thank you for running a workshop this afternoon to look at all of security products and the matrix of what they cover across all the platforms and systems.  it was certainly an eye opener and worth every minute.  we now know what we have where the coverage is and what overlap and what potential we have for consolidation. now its time to POC, test, validate and proceed.\n\n100#Hackathon Speakers!|To our Hackathon speakers – amazing, amazing job! We thank you for taking the time to share your knowledge and expertise with our humans! Your compelling and diverse insights have laid a comprehensive foundation that we know will only continue to impact and inspire future discussions ahead. What an incredible and energizing way to kick off Hackathon! Bravo!\n\n101#AI Hackathon Speakers|Thank you all for the engaging and inspiring sessions for our Hackathon event.  These sessions provided hundreds of our humans with an understanding of Generative AI, its opportunities and challenges,  and Workhuman's desire to be at the forefront of innovation in this space.   You all were incredibly supportive of this initiative, taking time out of your calendars on short notice to deliver amazing sessions, informing and motivating our humans for the hackathon and generating excitement for what is still to come.  Few companies are better positioned to leverage Generative AI  while ensuring humans remain the operating heartbeat of a company and its culture.  Thank you all again for contributing to a fantastic event and kicking off our AI Hackathon in style!\n\n102#You were recognized!|You were recognized during the Enterprise West Team meeting.  Thank you for supporting Lisa with the Infosec meeting for The Medical University of South Carolina. You cheerfully jumped right in, even when we didn't have full direction or an agenda from our prospects.  You approached the situation with a smile and willingness to provide your expertise. Thank you for supporting Lisa and the Enterprise West Team.\n\n103#Support where and when needed!|Playing cat and mouse with a ‘Bad Actor’ requires diligence, attention to detail and doggedness. You showed all these traits during our recent fraud attempt as we watched an external party ‘have a go’ through lots of different channels. Thank you so much for stepping up and responding, using your extensive knowledge to thwart the activity and protect our systems. Your efforts are very much appreciated.\n\n104#Splunk APM Workshop|All - just to say thanks for your time today in attending the workshop with Splunk and all of your valuable contributions to the session.  Looking forward to continue in evolving our thoughts around Application Performance Mgt.\n\n105#This is RIO GRANDE news|I am THRILLED to share that Rio Tinto has joined the Workhuman family (9 million USD) This win is so impressive for a variety of reasons…  Way back in early 2022, Subh scheduled some incredible CXO level meetings at Rio which started the sales cycle at the right level. As James engaged them in WHY recognition was key to solving some of their burning issues (their culture report showed there was HUGE room for improvement), Naomi and Meisha-Ann provided amazing expertise to support the case for change. James built strong trust based relationships with the key members of the project team who have looked to him for guidance since the outset.  And Eric inspired their global CPO which was the final missing piece of the puzzle to get the project approved.  This stellar team did such a tremendous job that the project team at Rio decided to sole source Workhuman but as we all know, there are many battles to be won in a complex sales cycle and  we were made to go to RFP in early Q1 2023.   What has happened the past few months is a masterpiece in team work. Mark led the initial RFP efforts and crafted an outstanding proposal that left Rio in no doubt as to who their strategic partner should be. So many team members were involved in helping put our best foot forward, including a special mention to Orlagh (for her very many inputs to all the InfoSec questions sent our way) and Mindi, leading the way on exploring how we could support Rio with an eComm offering  in Monglolia.  Christie and Hillary in Legal used every ounce of their  experience, to find solutions to a myriad of complex legal requirements. They joined very early morning calls to engage with their counterparts  and with help from Nick, we finally got this contract over the line. Their combined efforts were inspiring, thank you.  inally, a big thank you to Tom L, Tom V, Steve and Chris who huddled together to brainstorm how to overcome some last minute hurdles.   James - congratulations, You really are GOLD.\n\n106#STERIS (all caps)....Another Life Sciences Win!!!|Congrats to this amazing team on an impressive win at STERIS (17k ees in over 30 countries).  This deal entered excite back in September (thanks Ashley) and has been working through contracts for close to four months.  It took flawless execution from Orlagh to navigate the complex data requirements of STERIS and the unparalleled expertise of both Julia and Dan to guide the agreements to closure.  Their proactivity to jump on a call with STERIS legal early in the process, set us up for a very strong working relationship with their counsel.   Of course Marcy set the vision and drove our differentiation, allowing us to knock out competition and gain top down support for this important launch.  But it was not all easy and only due to the incredible relationships that Aaron built with his primary contacts and the CHRO, were we able to work through some complex challenges and create a win-win solution for this new client.  Thanks also to Tom V for your steady hand, guidance and feedback along the way.  It takes a village.  Now that this thing is closed, all I can ask is...........WHO IS NEXT?????????????????\n\n107#Security Win!|Team, I wanted to say thank you for your support to Cognizant these last couple months. There was suspicious activity happening on the platform and we had to quickly put it to stop. You helped guide me in the proper direction with the client to alleviate the issue. Furthermore, the client had requested a large amount of data so they could conduct an internal investigation. This was a heavy lift for Workhuman and the client was so impressed with what we were able to provide. That being said I wanted to thank you all for your effort, hopping on a client call and all the support we were able to provide this customer.\n\n108#Data Day YAY!|Congratulations on your success in the delivery of the first-ever Data Day event! Your expertise and dedication have brought to life an invaluable forum for discussing important themes in the world of data. The sessions were engaging and informative, ranging from Information Security, Data Agility, and Data APIs through to the Evolution of a Data Platform, Dimensional Data Modelling, Natural Language Processing, and more. All were incredibly well-explored and presented. Your collective efforts have not only demonstrated the dynamic and transformative role of data in our world today but also paved the way for the building of a progressive data community internally. This event's success is a testament to your exceptional knowledge, skill, and commitment to inspiring and driving change through data. Let’s keep the momentum going and continue to make a mark in the world of data at Workhuman together. Well done!\n\n109#Audit Success|This was a true team effort across the board! Orlagh, it was very nice having you over and seeing you face to face! Thank you and Laury for the leadership on teaching us rookies the ropes as we move forward as an Office Team! You both went out of your way to explain what and why things are being checked and walking us all through all the bits and pieces that make the Audit a success!!! It was a very busy week in the office and everyone had this as a top priority! Thank you all for the extra hours, sweat and tears (from laughing) to make this a true Team Success!!!\n\n110#Sharing your expertise!|Appreciate your willingness to participate in multiple call with the Kohler team.  Your knowledge and conviction is just what we needed to address some lingering questions they had.  I know they are trying to get us to enter territory outside of our comfort zone, but you navigated the conversation masterfully.   Thank you very much for your continued support!!\n\n111#Thank you for the subject matter expertise|Orlagh, thank you so much for offering and agreeing to help with the recruitment privacy and retention policy. It will help us to maintain a stronger and more engaged pipeline of candidates for future opportunities. You have been so helpful in answering multiple of our questions, and always with a smile on your face. Thanks again, it's a pleasure to work with you.\n\n112#Playing to win MBDA|This was a true team effort today and I'm proud to be part of such a fantastic team.   Thank you, Emily and Naomi, for helping me prepare the presentation and for presenting today. Thank you Orlagh and Josephine for your great support during this 2h long call. Thank you Amanda for being such a valuable help with the slides. Thank you Joe for helping me prepare this presentation strategically.\n\n113#Data Platform & Data Sharing|Orlagh, I want to recognize and appreciate the great support you provided for the Data Platform Team as we managed through some recent data sharing issues. The positive and supportive way in which you assisted was extremely important in making sure we got the best outcome possible.   Being able to work collaboratively and openly in resolving questions around data privacy and quality concerns makes resolving the issue and reducing risk in the longer term so much easier.   Thanks for all your help.\n\n114#Allison Transmission joins the WH family!!|Sincere thanks to the team of teams that worked alongside me to bring Allison Transmission into the WH family!   Tom, sincere thanks for your dedicated support & knocking down any barriers to ensure we had a signed contract by 3/30!  Michelle, I am most grateful for the time & support invested throughout the “reconnecting”, Investment Modeling & more meetings! Omar, my right hand man, I am SOOOO thankful for all of the support over the last 19 months w/ our internal/pre/post/client mtgs! Dave- I appreciate the initial support & yes- they did come back around! Nina- thank you for partnering with us to get Tracey & team to look at the bigger investment picture. Orlagh & Michael- WOW- I appreciate the quick IT assessment turnaround & support on IT mtg. Chuck, Dan, Joe and Hillary- words cannot express the sincere appreciation I have for you & the timely contracting support you provided!  Hari & Nuvs- nothing like a last minute client call- thank you for pinch-hitting!\n\n115#For all your help building Experiences!|Team - A sincere thank you to this broad cross-functional group that has banded together over the past 6 months to get us to the point where we're ready to launch Experiences for our customers.  It has been quite the journey from the \"we're going to build this\" stage to where we are today.  I can honestly say that it took every single one of you to get us where we are today.  From the small roles when we were in a pinch to the big roles of PMing the day-to-day (Susan + Linda!), every task and responsibility was vital to getting us to this point.  There was a lot of learning, ups and downs, and changes in course, but through it all this group stayed steadfast in the pursuit to build a great additional way for our users to redeem their points for something meaningful.  This has been the most impressive collaboration across so many teams that I've seen at my time at Workhuman - and that was only possible because of the fantastic humans involved.  I know that this disrupted many roadmaps and strategic plans, but through all of it you all gave your full attention to the work at hand and lended all of your collective experience to navigate a windy road and ultimately build a great solution.  Thank you for the hard work, dedication, and perseverance through the past 6 months - I can't wait to see it live and in action soon!  I'm eternally grateful for this group and look forward to continue building the future of Experiences as we get rolling.  THANK YOU!\n\n116#Employee Appreciation & International Women's Day|Hi All,   Wanted to wish you all a belated Employee appreciation day, you all make things possible and more enjoyable!  And to all the ladies in my team, we are way stronger than we think. Cheers to us...\n\n117#DuPont one step closer|Orlagh - thank you for your participation in the cyber security review with DuPont last week. Clearly we hit the mark for them as you were able to ease any fears they initially had. You were very responsive to their requests, and demonstrated again why Workhuman is the vendor for DuPont. They’ll be a great logo for us once they sign, and I thank you for being part of this process with us! Thanks Orlagh\n\n118#Attendance, Participation and Feedback!|I wanted to thank you both for taking the time to attend many of our OKR reviews over the last 2 weeks. I appreciate both the time dedicated to attending these and the benefits we will see across the team. Your active participation in these reviews has helped to ensure that we are all on the same page and working towards the same goals. You both offered valuable input and feedback that will contribute to the success of our OKR process, and we are all grateful for your contributions. Lastly, I hope that you each also found these reviews to be beneficial, and that they have helped you to deliver on your individual and team goals. Thank you again!\n\n119#Speedy response to teams 🙏|Orlagh, (again!) thank you for the practically instant response and support you provided to the teams who needed infosec and compliance advice today. Liaising with legal and the tech teams to drive a path forward with speed.\n\n120#Contracts, Amendments and Assessments, Oh My!|Hillary, Steve, Chuck, and Orlagh, this THANK YOU is long overdue! I cannot express enough how much I appreciate your invaluable expertise and unwavering partnership on the renewal process for some of our most important clients. You've dedicated countless hours creating analytical spreadsheets, negotiating terms, pouring over multi-faceted security questionnaires, and navigating redlines to ensure we secured the successful renewal of LinkedIn's, Intuit's, and Lilly's contracts. I'm in awe of your diligence, meticulous attention to detail, and depth of knowledge. Your partnership has been critical in ensuring that we maintain strong relationships with our clients.\n\n121#And the Oscar goes to . .|Although I am not in a position to hand out Oscar nominations I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to participate in our EB video campaign. These videos will help to increase brand awareness and in return candidate pipeline. I can only imagine how busy you all are and taking time out of your day to do this is very much appreciated.   Amazing leadership team, always leading by example!\n\n122#Technology Strategy Offsite|Thanks for bringing your enthusiasm, energy and ideas to our Technology Strategy Offsite. My Thanks to you all for a great day and providing some wonderful momentum behind us as we plough forward through a big year for us all. Thanks to Sara for the organization of the myriad of details for the day and for being our note taker supreme.\n\n123#WAF and the end user experience|Thanks Orlagh and team for diving into the user experience issues identified in Conversations and our firewall. Looking forward to getting the issue quantified and a better understanding on how to solve it. Thanks for your partnership and proactive approach which will ensure a great user experience as we look to grow the Conversations user base. 🙏 🙏 🙏\n\n124#BINGO! Facilitator Dream Team|Orlagh and Jonathan- on behalf of myself, Tiffany, and Brittany, we wanted to extend a massive thank you and note of appreciation for stepping up and leading the Security & Privacy Differentiator breakout sessions. You took this head on and made it your own- your energy, enthusiasm (Number 3, Cup of Tea!), and knowledge on this differentiator made for laugh-filled, engaging, and informative sessions. Facilitating FIVE sessions of Bingo (& Security & Data Bingo nonetheless) was no easy feat, but your energy and can-do spirits made it seem effortless. Thank you again for bringing your imagination and innovation to Activate, we appreciate you!\n\n125#Activate execution at its finest|Team, you did it, it was incredible, and I’m proud to say we’re back!  We concluded Activate 2023 – bringing back an in person sales and customer kickoff after 3 years of hiatus.  I know you all went through months of preparation and planning, dotting “I’ crossing “T’s”, creating virtual, in-office, and in-person experiences, filming and facilitating Differentiator workshops, and more. You executed flawlessly, dealt with challenges without hesitation and ensured all our humans were informed with comprehensive communications throughout the event and fun well-thought-out games that allowed for maximum retention of our strengths. You created in-office experiences, provided an environment for everyone to thrive and engage, and you all put your best selves forward.  Thank you for always upping your game and never settling for the status quo. You did it and did it exceptionally well.  Thank you!\n\n126#DIFFERENCE MAKERS|Team- A heartfelt “thanks” to you all for stepping in and stepping up to lead the important and impactful differentiator workshops at Activate. It was obvious to all attendees that you put in the hard work to ensure these sessions were content-rich, interactive, and a real jumping off point for comprehensive and ongoing enablement for all our humans. The feedback has been outstanding and that’s a testament to the knowledge and passion you each brought to room. You owned it, and it showed so well.\n\n127#Thank you|Wanted to thank you both for all of the work that you consistently put into onboarding, and for always being very supportive of my requests for help and for all the things you do to generally; like the trainings you’ve provided, the advice and guidance on new regions and much more. It’s a pleasure to work with you both.\n\n128#Always accommodating|Orlagh, this is overdue but thank you for all your support to me and to the wider Database team last year.  You have allowed Enda help us out on numerous occasions knowing that you are tight already on resources, jumped in to provide that extra help when needed.  You are always so accommodating and your support has been greatly appreciated.  Thank you for all you do and I hope to work more closely with you on Data Security this coming year.  Thanks again. Tony\n\n129#Warm welcome into the team|I just wanted to say, thank you all for the warm welcome. I am so excited to work with you all and contribute to the success of the team and company.\n\n130#A perfect way to end 2022!|Team - thank you all for your support, guidance and patience as we navigated the sometimes choppy waters of the Sanofi recognition RFP. From demonstrating how recognition can support Sanofi's Olympic partnership, an impromptu request to visit Sanofi HQ or a last minute change in legal resource, this one really had it all!   The process required a truly collaborative spirit and you all at some point produced work of the highest quality, often at very short notice. One of the key considerations for Sanofi throughout the selection process was that they were looking for a partner and the feedback we've had was that we demonstrated our commitment to this at each and every stage.  We have a wonderful opportunity to grow this relationship and I am incredibly grateful for the role that each and every one of you played in bringing this fantastic client onboard - and beating the buzzer right at the end of 2022!   Thank you all!\n\n131#Thank you from the bottom of my heart!|Sincere thanks to my AMAZING team members that worked with me to win Associated Materials over & have them officially join the WH family on December 30th! Kendall, I could not be more excited for our 1st win as a team!  Going from a DISCO call on Nov 9th to the presentation and demo on Nov 15th was exciting & together we established a firm trust foundation for Sarah.  Joe, I cannot thank you enough for consistently turning the MNDA requests around so quickly- that sets the stage for the client- showing that we have a sense of urgency!   Omar, YOU ARE AMAZING!  It is a such a privilege to work alongside you.  We met Sarah where she was at and together, based on her personality and questions- had an exceptional call together- further building up the confidence with/for Sarah.  Then w/ the very last minute meeting with the SVP of IT- winning her over immediately! Orlagh, I am blessed to work with you.  Thank you SO very much for making time to meet w/ Tammi as you head out. 😊  GREAT call- checking all of the IT boxes. Michael & Dan, thank you for your very quick responses to all questions that Sarah had as she evaluated her vendors.  Your timely response makes such a big difference! Michelle & Scott, I appreciate your offer to escalate when necessary & work behind the scenes to get approvals and contracts released! Chuck, Christie & Hillary- WOW & THANK YOU!  You all are AMAZING! Thank you so very much for ALL of your help w/ the contracting/approval/signature processes!  You were all off/out and made the commitment to get this over the finish line for us.  I am so thankful for your dedication to me, the leadership team & our new client! TEAM, thank you all again for your part in building the trust with our prospect, working with urgency on every request & making it possible in a short period of time to get Associated Materials across the line & into the WH family.  Sincere thanks from the bottom of my heart!\n\n132#Flutter dream team!|A massive thank you to each and every one of you! Winning Flutter's business was a true team effort and the starting point was Anna, taking the lead on our RFP response. You clearly produced a powerful proposal Anna, as the Head of Reward told me that it was evident we were the best fit for their requirements based on our response. Very nicely done indeed!...Orlagh, Rich and Dan, you all dealt with some extremely challenging requirements around multiple programme capabilities and data security/access, but again, Vlad at Flutter was seriously impressed by what he saw, both in terms of what you created in the branded demo, as well as addressing their constant flow of detailed technical programme design & security questions. And Christie, your deep knowledge meant that we were always on the front foot and you were able to lead Flutter's legal team to exactly where we wanted them to be and within the timelines we'd stipulated. Thank you all!!\n\n133#Not too busy to care!|Orlagh, Thank YOU so very much for your support and involvement with Associated Materials!  As you are looking to head off on holiday- we have an “urgent request” to meet with the SVP of IT who will provide approval to “move forward” with the contract (or not).  You agreed to meet internally to get up to speed on the prospect and where we are in the contracting process and then with the SVP of IT as you are leaving.  With all of the other priorities on your plate and other SLT reaching out, deadlines to meet, contracts to close on and so, so very much more, you agreed to fit me and Associated Materials in.  The meeting with Tammi with fantastically fine- so much so that she provided her “stamp of approval” to move forward without having to go through a formal documentation process- AMAZING!  Thank YOU!  Thank you so very much for making each and every prospect and employee a priority!  We appreciate YOU!\n\n134#Daily SWAT - The End|As the curtains come down on another season of daily SWAT we would like to thank all of you for your active participation.  This year’s SWAT was slightly longer than previous years, this reflects how the 'busy time' has gotten busier and longer which in turn highlights the importance of running this. For all attendees, thank you for the time and care taken to review your systems and for bringing those insights to team. For the Infosec folks, Enda, Robyn, and Simon thank you for taking on the duties of arranging the SWAT, comms, minutes, and reporting. Hope you all have a great break and see you in the new year for the weekly SWAT.\n\n135#Developer Experience Ask Me Anything!|A few hours before Mihai was due to do the Lunch & Learn on Developer Experience we had the idea of creating a public AMA (Ask Me Anything) slack channel for Developer Experience! Dante, thanks for your guidance on what was required, Orlagh thanks for your prompt responses on what was required, Daniyal and Alma - thanks for creating and setting up the channel!  For anyone interested in learning more about what Developer Experience is all about, please feel free to join the channel ama-developer-experience - AMA (ask me anything), a channel for all things developer experience related. We will share information and interesting links - listen, watch, read!

We already have a fabulous Confluence space with lots of great info!\n\n136#Griffith Goodness|Dan and Orlagh, Thank you so much for your help with the Griffith call this morning.  They were hyper sensitive when it came to all things IT and security and you both provided your expertise to help them feel secure in our offering.  This is a client that has the potential to grow so ensuring they feel good from the start is key.  Thanks so much for joining us!\n\n137#VPN Access|Thanks everyone for all the work you have done over the past few days, weeks or month to get us to the point where we have Avanade/Accenture now able to access the Git repositories needed for the MS 365 development work.  All your work is appreciated and all the better now that we have our first checked-in code and confirmed access for all users that needed.  Thanks again everyone.\n\n138#Heineken RFP team|I want to take a moment to recognise everyone who contributed to the Heineken pitch today. It is very easy to look good when you have this kind of support and I can't express my gratitude for the your contributions in this effort to win them as a global customer. You are all outstanding at what you do. Thank-you.\n\n139#Last Minute Questions for Global Payments|Orlagh, Brendan, and Gerard - we received some questions from Global Payments and their IT team on the day before Thanksgiving in the US that were urgent and related to their ability to configure Production SSO. With the client attempting to launch the week of December 12th, responses back to them were critical, and the customer followed up with the launch team in the US as soon as we were back from the holiday. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on these urgent questions that will help propel us to launch.\n\n140#A warm welcome|Hi all, I wanted to take a minute and officially thank you for the warm welcome you have all given me and the fact that I got to meet you in person, made it even better.

I am very excited to see what the future holds for us and thank you for making me feel like I am already part of the team 😊\n\n141#Pulling together to solve an urgent issue|Thank you all for the support, quick thinking and pulling together this week to solve an issue that could have been very big. Between providing support, availability to provide guidance, reaching out to contacts outside of the company, fast development and testing and thinking outside of the box for a successful solution, we were able to resolve the first step and biggest hurdle this morning. Thank you!\n\n142#Leadership Interview|Orlagh - thank you so much for taking the time to be interviewed by my friend in your capacity as a member of the senior leadership team. This was a vital part of her Postgraduate Diploma in school leadership and your valuable time was greatly appreciated!\n\n143#Sales support and enablement!|Orlagh and Jim - Thank you for taking the time to join the all-hands sales call today.  As we focus on differentiating ourselves it's important the sales team is up to speed on the great work that's taking place in IT/Security and Workhuman Listens.  Both of your presentations were very informative and provided useful information that can be used in upcoming sales pursuits.  Thanks again for helping to support our team!!\n\n144#Thank you for the first wonderful 2 months in WH!|Hi All, i just wanted to take the opportunity to say thanks to everyone of you for the warm welcome you have given me.

Cheers!\n\n145#Avanade access - progress|Just wanted to send you all a huge thanks for all the effort you have put in over the past few weeks to get us to a point where we have 1 Avanade user merging code into WH and  huge progress on being able to get the other users access with respect to acceptable scan results and compliance.\n\n146#ISO27001 Audit Awesomeness|Thanks for all your preparation and constant vigilance that goes in to passing the ISO27001 audit. Not to mention the 2 day interrogation of the audit itself. You make it look easy but I know the million details that you are coordinating behind the scenes to ensure it goes swimmingly every time. And as an extra bonus, my desk has never been tidier…Awesome job!\n\n147#Putting the \"H\" in Human|What a tough week I had this week.  The first year anniversary of my Dad's passing,  not to mention a whole bunch of different initiatives going - some of which required particularly heavy lifting.   Aside from my woes,  you all had a tough week between travelling, audits, visitors, projects and yet each one of you reached out to a colleague (me ) to lend support and even stopped by just to see how I was doing with it all.   You all put the \"H\" in human for me this week.  thank you\n\n148#Got a ride?|Orlagh, thank you for offering to drive me back to my hotel on a windy, rainy night. It was such a pleasure spending some extra time with you and I hope that your chicken quesadillas were delicious!\n\n149#InfoSec Questionnaires|Orlagh, Michael, over the past few weeks, I've leaned on you both heavily for your help with InfoSec questionnaires. The latest and greatest being from our mining friends down under. What a mission that was to address all their many hundreds of questions. Thank you both so much for keeping a sense of urgency about getting this completed and ensuring we hit the clients' deadline - especially in light of all the many critical initiatives you're both working on at the same time! THANK YOU!!\n\n150#Enabling a colleague|Thank you all for your urgency in answering my queries, solving my access issues, and fixing my applications. This has enabled me to do my job better and support my team.\n\n151#Thank you Ipsen Launch Team!|CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU to the amazing team that contributed to the Ipsen to launch!  My journey on this project began after many thoughtful and detailed conversations with Ipsen had already taken place.  Thank you for Alex, Emily, Naomi, and Jen for providing important intel, guidance, and support for our in-person HRLT meeting in the Ipsen Cambridge office this past June.  Alex, a special thank you for your continued support throughout launch.  Orlagh your data privacy and security expertise was woven throughout pre-contract and implementation - thank you for your quick turnaround time and transparency with our European client.  Our Ipsen journey has been a 'labor of love' for our core launch team.  Matt Gillen, thank you for your support and guidance in all things launch strategy and more.  Joyce and Mary-Liz, you are truly the A-Team of Consulting, Training, and Communications, often fielding questions that WH's most seasoned colleagues have not encountered while flexing to provide recorded and in-person demos often with limited notice.  Guilherme, your support of our SOLI and reporting conversations was critical in instilling confidence and partnership throughout launch process.  Dan Fiore, thank you for your patience and expertise in supporting Ipsen in their continued Workday Integration conversations and detailed SOLI discussions.   Brittany, an overdue THANK YOU for your sense of urgency and skill in meeting our client's timeline for all necessary launch checklist items and more.  A huge shout out to Robert McArdle, Johnny Grant, Luka Crljen, Gerard MacDonald, Rahul Bagave in Production Support for helping deliver a successful implementation with many time-sensitive requests and oh so many PGP keys and payroll files.  Cliona, your flexibility and skill never cease to amaze me - a beautiful job with Bravo! branding with many requests and tight timeline.  Bravo! to the Ipsen launch team in helping shepherd Ipsen in building a culture of gratitude.\n\n152#Outstanding Support Near the Finish Line|Team - I'm grateful for all of the Infosec/Operational support you have provided us the past few weeks as we work towards bringing Mazars USA across the finish line as a Workhuman client. As a global audit, accounting and consulting group, they required multiple questionnaires, checklists, and plenty of additional questions that you were able to answer in full detail in a short period of time. This allowed them to have full confidence in Workhuman and give the green light to us from an IT perspective. Thank you for all you've done and for your continued support!\n\n153#ATS YES!|Team, congrats on a very satisfying win at ATS!!  This is another key Canadian client acquisition, that was certainly no easy task.  This account opportunity was opened back in 2019 and then spent over a year in prove and contract stages.  Without rehashing all of the intricacies, they deal required a tremendous amount of grit, determination, creativity and perseverance.   It also required the best of our team and a broad group of contributors.  Ankur, a special congrats to you as the deal quarterback.  This was also your first win, so an extra special milestone for you!  Your ability to build strong relationships with the ATS team all the way up to the CHRO was essential.  Rob, your relationship with Stephanie in the account was also key, as was your continuous engagement in the sales process.  I think you shared that this deal holds the record for the most SA meetings of all time....WOW.  Maggie and Erin, you contributed to this lofty record and your expertise is always much appreciated.  Rich, thanks for stepping in to offer launch guidance and Orlagh, thanks for getting the entire team comfortable with our security processes.  In the end, Christie you led the charge on contracts with some support from Julia and Joe (Joe put this through DocuSign 5 or 6 times).  Again, this was a journey and required a true team effort.  Thanks to everyone involved.  Enjoy this win!\n\n154#Collaboration|Thank you Orlagh for all your recent help and for supporting me on different queries, you are always ready to help. Your time and your help is appreciated.\n\n155#An Out Of This World Kind Of Thank You!|Team, knowing what a huge undertaking we had ahead of us this morning, I am thrilled to be able to say “Wow! That was a really good meeting!”. Having witnessed all the monumental effort in prep, the reality is that wasn’t a coincidence. You’ve all worked so hard for us to realize this moment. I am deeply appreciative of the partnership, patience and the expertise you have given me throughout this process. Some of you had the added pressure of travelling and nursing sick children, yet still brought your best selves to the table. While their 2 major grievances threatened to rain on us a few times, because we overprepared, there was nothing they could ask that we were not ready to answer. All the question and answer sessions, open dialogue and role playing certainly paid off! It is always so inspiring seeing you all in your element and I got front row seats today. While we still have an uphill battle before we secure a win on this RFP, PLEASE take a moment today to acknowledge how awesome you were today! Stellar performance all the way to the moon and back!\n\n156#Super Judges!|Thank you so much to Mary Berry (Orlagh), Paul Hollywood (Jonathan) and Prue Leith (Ronan) for judging the Great Technology and Product Bake Off this week. You really brought some great fun to the event, with your hilarious comments, at times constructive feedback and the odd brutal comment (not mentioning a certain roulade). Most importantly, we managed to collect money for a really good cause, and it's all down to your help. Thank you!\n\n157#Shining through folk Colgate|Thanks so much for digging in and giving up some your weekend and very early Monday morning time to prepare ande execute for Colgate!  As a team we are able to prepare and present the best of Workhuman and as such put the best foot forward showing the prospective customer why they should trust the happiness and security of their employees recognition program to the true market leader!  You rocked this in every way and as we all know will continue to prove our worth on a regular basis and each step along the way will show attention to detail, doing all the necessary research and providing the client with all the data they need to make the correct decision. Thanks for brainstorming, thinking, and driving this forward together!\n\n158#Leidos Mobile Questions|Some level of detail here team, congrats to you all for getting this squared away as another step in moving this one to contracts and then close. I’m sure I’m missing folks from the info sec team, this is a team game and I appreciate everyone of you.\n\n159#Everything you do, makes us better|Thank you each and everyone.  You and the teams that support you.  This week has been hectic as we in Integrations land have numerous initiatives and projects landing and taking off simultaneously.  Knowing we have the backing and availability, even very last minute, of subject matter experts who can lead us calmly, has been of maximum value.  We're often in deep technical assessments and deployments, where the viewpoints and skills you bring greatly augment our work.  In fact you are often the key arbiter & assessor of whether what we are doing is fit for purpose and meets our own stringent deployment and security requirements.  Thank you from the whole team for your patience, support and availability. Without this, many of the projects we are engaging in would be infinitely harder to complete.    The good news?  We're learning each time we go thru this.  And we've got a lot more fun stuff to do.  Working with you will make this all the richer an experience.\n\n160#Amazing support|Thank you so much Orlagh for all your help this week with BP's queries regarding pen results and security assessment. I'm always impressive with your quick responses. I really appreciate you! Thanks for being an awesome colleague! We are so lucky to have you!\n\n161#Thank YOU, Hyland Heroes!|It takes an entire community of people to provide a client with the appropriate timely support, guidance and TLC throughout the sales/education/security-onboarding/IT/contracting processes!  Dave and Naomi, I am grateful for your partnership early on when Hyland came back a year after our initial discussions to focus on R&R! Jennie and Orlagh, WOW- thank you for taking on the task of filling out all of the Hyland Onboarding/Security/Compliance questionnaires and ensuring we were ready for the \"next step\" in the process.  Jen, when we got a bit stuck, you happily reached out to VP, Kathleen, for the Gartner roundtable- which not only helped us move the conversation along, but also established a key executive relationship.  Dan, I am so, so thankful for the time and effort spent meeting multiple times with the IT team- answering questions and giving them the assurance that this WH-WD integration will be seamless! Chuck- thank you for the quick turnaround on the contract documents- with the revisions too!  Erin- many thanks for leading the Early Decisioning Workshop!  Tom, I really appreciate you partnering with Michelle to keep the contracting process moving along!  Hillary and Christie- heartfelt thanks for ALL of the support during the contracting/negotiating process- nothing like daily legal team meetings for 1 1/2 weeks! Michelle, I sincerely appreciate all of your support and contributions during the presentations, WH Live- relationship building, negotiations and providing that encouragement when we got \"stuck\" a few times- SO THANKFUL!  And Omar- last but certainly not least- THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!  I cannot thank you enough for ALL of your help with the presentations, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement, the WH Live connections with the Hylanders, the onsite visit and further relationship building and more! You all are \"my people\" and I SO appreciate all of YOU and your contribution to the Hyland Software win!\n\n162#Ochsner Ovation|Three hurricanes, a two-year global health crisis, massive budget cuts…but we did it!  Ochsner Health System is officially a Workhuman client!!!  This four year journey was a an endurance test that required the help of a huge team of folks.  The person who stood by me the longest, making countless presentations and sometimes facing down angry nurses, is Corinne Selk.  Corinne, your incredible knowledge of the healthcare space, creativity and patience are a huge reason we were able to gain the confidence of Ochsner from day 1!   Hari, Naomi and Omar, you all helped out with various demonstrations and conversations along the way!  Lauren Spencer, thank you for helping bring the communications’ leadership over to the Workhuman corner by wowing them with your extensive charm and expertise in the areas of change management & communications.  Tom Vitkofsky, thank you for your pricing support! Michael Rob and Orlagh Lynch, thank you for your speedy and praiseworthy help with our IT security.  Daniel Oxenkrug and Julia Towle, thank you for the many iterations of the contract documents and patiently working with the Ochsner attorney.  Last, but not least, thank you Lisa Orr.  You were an incredible partner in bringing focus to the rather disorganized final approval process at Ochsner. I am sure I have missed a few folks, so my apologies, but thank you so much for your support in bringing in this 36,000 employee healthcare system to the Workhuman fold.\n\n163#ITGC co-ordination|Thank you Enda & Orlagh for all your work so far in identifying the ITGC control owners and in helping to deliver our first training session.

Looking forward to the continuing the great collaboration! :)\n\n164#Teamwork is the dreamwork|Orlagh and Michael,  Thank you both so much for all your help and support on the Infosec questionnaires and surveys for Prisma.

Orlagh, also a special shout-out for re-arranging your schedule to attend the finalist meeting.   Thank you ...thank you... thank you\n\n165#Aftership Project Up And Running! 🎉🎉|All, thank you for your continued support in helping to get this project up and running! The integration project will provide multiple operational efficiencies, as well as providing an enhanced customer experience.  Aftership will deliver nearer to real time data for parcel/shipment tracking information through a Workhuman branded tracking page. The tracking page can be designed to inform employees of up-coming events or promotional marketing content and will also encourage employees to go come back into our Workhuman suite of products. Other benefits of the integration will provide Workhuman with the ability to pro-actively notify customers of delays/events with their shipments, systematically for the first time! Additionally, aftership provides functionality which could enable us to present an estimated delivery date at the point of purchase! Exciting times ahead, looking forward to seeing the improvements that this project will deliver, thanks again for your support and enjoy!\n\n166#Outstanding Team Worley|A massive thank you to each of you for your guidance and support throughout the Worley sales and RFP process. As ever, these big opportunities are only ever won if we use the collective wisdom of our very best...and that's exactly what I did! We needed to get creative with many aspects of our proposal and I greatly appreciate everyone's willingness to stretch on this one. Chris, thanks for your patience & support as we worked through alignment with the right client partners, while also juggling numerous other prospect requests from me at the same time! Rob & Orlagh, what you don't know about your subjects, simply isn't worth knowing. You instill absolute confidence in Workhuman as THE Thought Leader in our industry. Thank you for always being willing to roll your sleeves up at short notice & deliver your best. And of course Mr Simon...what a wordsmith! You created a masterpiece and set us on the path to success. Without your support, we'd be nowhere, so thank you my friend.\n\n167#A True Team of Support and Innovation|I wanted to thank each of you for your help, efforts, and support over the past many months - as we pursued the potential Thank You Healthcare kiosk pilot at Newton Wellesley Hospital. The wide range of work was impressive - from concept building, selling the hospital, UI development, contract drafting, market research, architecture fit, security measures, and so much more. And while the project is being tabled until 2023, the work you have all done is so valuable and provided us amazing insights regardless of future decisions. Thank you all!\n\n168#Stellar Submission!|During a security assessment meeting with our prospective clients at Ochsner Health System, a system architect from Ochsner commented on the quality of the security information submitted.  He said \"I've seen around 300 of these things and they are not typically done well.  When you see a good one, it stands out.  This one is stellar!\"  As the meeting wrapped up, the Director of Applications also said this was among the better security meetings he has attended.  Thank you Michael and Orlagh for your attention to detail and quality work.  Security meetings conducted well are critical to ensure our deals move forward.  We win together as a united team across all areas of our business.  Thank you for your exceptional teamwork.\n\n169#Super Panel|Thanks all for your sitting on the interview panels for the newest addition to the internal controls team. I really appreciate your time and feedback on the different candidates which was very valuable in helping us to find a great candidate!\n\n170#Speedy Security Review Experts|Orlagh and Michael,  Thank you so much for your record breaking turn around on the Ochsner security questionnaire.  Every minute counts in getting through the contracting process for a June close, so your help is greatly appreciated!    Beth\n\n171#Working together to support our customers|Thank you for the urgency shown when a customer query was brought to our attention. Alex as the CSM, you were concerned that something was off and engaged with Mike and Legal for guidance, your urgency and commitment to providing a quick response kicked this mini project into motion. Thank you for updating the customer, sharing the information and advising us of the outcome and any actions they requested.  Mike thank you for the guidance you gave and jumping in to help as we huddled together at WH Live to provide a quick and complete response. Lastly, Orlagh, our master of ceremonies, thank you for getting the information, creating the response and collaborating quickly to ensure we addressed the issue and provided the customer with the right amount of information to make an informed decision and take swift action.  It was wonderful to work with you, in real time, in person & on zoom Alex to address and resolve this important issue, appreciate the teamwork!\n\n172#Never ending Support|A massive thank you to you Orlagh and Michael for all of your ongoing support on multiple deals. Whether it's yet another round of detailed Infosec questions or another additional template that requires completion, you both always deliver, every time. Landing any new customer, always takes a village and you are certainly more involved than most in helping to drive us towards the finish line. Many thanks indeed!!\n\n173#Scanning to infinity and beyond!|To my amazing WHL scanning family - it takes a village and I am grateful for all of you! Not only did you show up literally, but you all showed up figuratively - when faced with various challenges. You kept the masses calm, came up with creative ways to keep the lines moving, smiled when the app/device/internet decided to take a break - you name it, you NAILED it! When we realized we needed more scanners for max capacity sessions, you answered the frenzied (ok yes, desperate) call for help! You were my Buzz Lightyears, (especially when I had that same look Woody has on his face in this picture) swooping in with a \"we got this\" attitude and a smile. While this \"job\" at WHL might have seemed mundane and thankless, it was actually mission-critical to the success of a large portion of the overall event and YOU are the reason we conquered! Thanks to each and every one of you for being the amazing teammates that you are!\n\n174#Huge thanks for IT process & control discovery|Thanks Orlagh & Dante for your significant contribution to the KPMG workshops across a number of areas. We're at the start of this journey and your overview and continued engagement with KPMG has helped us get a better understanding of WH's IT landscape and the overarching processes & controls which is a great baseline for moving forward as we look to delve deeper into system/team specific ownership, processes & controls over the weeks and months ahead! Thank you!\n\n175#ISO 27001 Preparation|InfoSec team members - continuous thanks for your ongoing efforts leading up to our most recent ISO 27001 recertification audit! Many may not realize the full extent of work that goes into this behind the scenes -- it includes (but is far from limited to) keeping numerous policies and procedures inventoried and current; managing our IT security risk and control catalogues; coordinating with our business teams to review and update business continuity plans for critical systems and IT applications; conducting tabletop planning exercises for disaster recovery; chasing down many, many document requests; deploying security training to ensure risk awareness whether you are new or long-tenured with Workhuman; sweeping the office to ensure compliance with our Clean Desk Policy practices; and participating in the ISO audit itself!!! We could not achieve what we do without your contributions and expertise.  Cheers to some well-deserved rest after we complete this one!\n\n176#YUI Delivery for Citi|And so we made it. YUI remediation is finished, and what a fantastic project it was. This took cooperation from a  tremendous group to get delivered for Citi.   Thank you to Orlagh and Liam for being our link to Citi and for the great negotiation. Thank you to the Platform UX team for the creative remediation and retesting of everything (Michal, Will, Christina R, Yauheni, Natallia M, Natalia A, Graham, Cian and Aleh on loan!) Thank you to the QAs from the many many teams who were involved in the huge Quality effort, and in making sure that our changes didn't break anything (Soo, Declan, Ben, Iryna and Tatsiana). Thank you to Christina K, Geoffery and Mike for being supportive throughout and assisting us to the finishline.\n\n177#Fast Response!|Thank you all for the part you played in diagnosing, fixing and deploying an issue we found with the security headers in our MS Teams application. You all responded to my request quickly and with urgency resulting in us getting this resolved within 24hrs. I really appreciate the commitment to getting this done. Thank you!\n\n178#QTY Reporting|Thanks Orlagh and Dermot for your help with the quarterly report this week. There were a few key data points that I was unsure of, so appreciate you both taking the time to jump on calls/Slacks to answer questions/clarify info. Thanks!\n\n179#Solutioning a possible issue|Orlagh, Suzanne and Nicole Thank you for your availability to jump on a call last minute and discuss the issue related with Lockheed Martin. Questioning and getting the right answers is the best way to identify and solve, perfectly done and solution identified by Orlagh. Another possible issue stopped right from the start. Thank you!\n\n180#Team Prudential moved mountains for the win!|I always tell our prospective clients that WH will bring a SWAT Team of SMEs to ensure their success pre- and post-sale; I'd say this list proves this. Look at all the parts of the company involved: marketing, branding, RFP, sales enablement, customer success, launch success, product, engineering, legal, finance, ecomm, customer service, WHiQ, strategic advisory, strategy & consulting, operations, IT/security, sales, sales leadership. A special thank you to Marcy for once again being my go-to for all things, Mike for being my collaborator and trusting me to make or have a high degree of influence on key decisions and inflection points in the deal, Nuvs for his support in his new role as a liaison to sales - you are going to be busy for a very long time my friend, Naomi for helping me build trust early on with our program owner,  Mr. SMEchmitter for helping us drive the Value at different key points in the journey, to Mr. O'Sullivan for being our toughest sale (I kid, I kid), but in the end one of our greatest collaborators, Meisha-Ann for being our People Analytics assassin in and out, but killing the competition with our biggest differentiator, Mr. Robb and Orlagh for yet another heavy IT due diligence process.  This is a significant accomplishment, but I'm confident we will have just as many or more WH people building off of your efforts to ensure Prudential realizes the highest peaks of success on behalf of their employees with WH as their partner and the WH Cloud as an enabler. THANK YOU for your contributions to this momentous Workhuman win!\n\n181#Diageo Team - Cheers To You!|From our very first contact back in July, RFP in September, eliminated as a finalist in November to signatures today each of you played a key role in this roller coaster win for Workhuman!  Tom and Jason even had Eric send a personal note to our executive sponsor that included a picture of him enjoying a Guinness with his son...whatever it takes! This team played with it's back against the wall for a majority of the sales cycle and never lost focus, faith or confidence that Workhuman was the only provider to ensure Diageo meet it's lofty expectations.  Cheers To You!\n\n182#It takes a village|I wanted to personally thank this team for being flexible to meet last minute with Lincoln Financial. They had some concerns about transparency of information in our platform. These concerns could have derailed our plan for launch and damaged the customer relationship. Instead, the team pulled together and was able to provide both short- and long-term solutions for their concerns. This has made our customer relationship stronger. Thank you for meeting our customer where they were and the support you provided.  It can certainly take a village.\n\n183#You all were the KEY to our success at Temenos!|Team Temenos!   FYI we are now VOC thanks to all of you – it really does take a village eh?!   To: Josh - for getting the ball rolling on this sales cycle! Emily – thanks for your constant support and guidance throughout this sales cycle. Naomi, Rob, Lynette & Dave – for the multiple times you all separately and sometimes together joined one of our calls to offer real insights and partnership to the Temenos team.  Stavroula made the point to me on a few occasions that it was our true partnership approach that made such a big difference versus the other vendors they considered, one of whom I know for sure was Achievers. Dan & Brian - for a wonderful/creative custom demo and to Lynette (again)  or coming up with the “Unlock Potential” branding which they really liked! Michael & Anna – for your excellent work on the RFP response and if I may say especially to Michael, a very BIG thank you indeed for all the work you did, despite also needing to look after your Mum at the same time – you really went “above and beyond” – thank you! Orlagh - for your part also in our RFP response and for the very reassuring call you did with their data security expert… Chris -for organizing the reference calls, which they also found very reassuring! THANK YOU ALL!\n\n184#Truly Amazing Teamwork!!!|After working for something for such a long period of time, it's fun to look back and think of all the little steps along the way that got you to the finish line.  We recently were able to bring Seagate into the Workhuman Family, and it wouldn't have been possible without this amazing group of individuals helping make it a reality.  Thank you all for your support throughout this incredible journey, which includes - prep for meetings, meetings, custom demo's, marketing campaigns, a micro-site, more meetings, more demos, value creation sessions, Workhuman Live Speakers, RFP preparation and submission, a trip to Denver, references, finalist presentations, follow up meetings, security reviews, pricing discussions, negotiations, and I'm sure a few more that I can't even remember.  It takes a herculean effort to bring in a new customer on board, and you are all truly appreciated...thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\n\n185#Amazing Team Collaboration on Westfield Insurance!|Thank you all for partnering with me to bring another amazing client, Westfield Insurance, into the Workhuman family!!  Michael and Anna, I cannot thank you enough for all of your support, time and effort throughout the RFI and RFP processes!  Michael, I am also grateful for the additional support and teaming up with Orlagh to get the IT/Security/Compliance assessments completed!  Omar, I am truly thankful to partner with you to create and share such personalized presentations, weaving in what matters most to our clients. Joe summed it up when he said, “You (Workhuman) made each of the Westfield team members feel seen, heard and appreciated!  You are the only vendor that had that “human approach” to every meeting, presentation, demo and even e-mails….”  Dave and John, sincere thanks for working on the investment modeling/value creation for the Westfield team!  Christie, I appreciate YOU! WOW, right?  Being able to partner on all of the contract documents, getting 90% of the approvals prior to both Legal teams meeting and obtaining agreement on the remaining items in about 30 minutes- that is a record, isn’t it?  😊  And, Scott, last but certainly not least- I am so glad that you were able to join in on the journey with Westfield.  Establishing that relationship with Joe is key as we prepare for that additional Investment Modeling/Value Creation meeting in August.  I appreciate your help during the contracting phase and meeting with Valerie and Mark to get the final contract documents reviewed and accepted.   Thank you ALL for working with me during the last 6 months to bring another client into the Workhuman family!  SOOOOOO GRATEFULL FOR YOU!!!!!!\n\n186##BreakTheBias|To a team that constantly improves the world around them,  Happy International Women's Day!\n\n187#Help with Huntsman|Thanks everyone for helping us bring in Huntsman as the newest member of the Workhuman family! Everyone here played a vital role in security reviews, legal/finance work, being flexible, executive alignment, etc. I appreciate everyone helping out with this, and can't wait to bring in more deals!\n\n188#Outstanding Execution|A massive thanks to each of you (Naomi, Orlagh & Lynette), for the parts you played in both preparing for and executing Worley's RFP presentation. As always, a lot of preparation went into this, with multiple prep calls. At the last minute, we were thrown a curve ball in the form of a request to deliver a Safety message. Lynette, your scripting for this was exceptional and Naomi's delivery of it, started off a heart felt dialogue with the Worley team. Orlagh, I'm so glad you got the chance to demonstrate your deep knowledge and to put the Worley team's mind at rest on all of their queries. The good news is that we've been shortlisted to the next stage off the back of your efforts - THANK YOU!!\n\n189#Data & Documentation Support|An overdue thank you to you all for the support and prompt responses over the past 2 months. It feels like the world is in catch up mode after a challenging 2 years and I have been hugely grateful for your support in getting responses back to customers in a very timely manner. Joe, thanks for all your support with contracts - finding them, understanding them and always pointing me in the right direction. Hillary, thank you for all of your help preparing the documents and jumping on last minute calls to help us determine the best route for the partnerships. Orlagh, thank you for answering never-ending list of questions re: Log4J, and the multiple back and forth to help us get Germany onboard for both recognition and conversation launch at bp this week. A huge thank you!\n\n190#Excellent Y'all (EY)|Thank you so much team for the practical use of the 7 P’s during the past several weeks that allowed us to be more than prepared for our joint team presentation this morning!  I was hoping when we scheduled this on Twosday (2.22.22) that it would indeed turn out to be a positive harbinger of the execution and success on the day!  You guys really went above and beyond in preparing, listening, presenting and answering questions.  I couldn’t have done in better myself!  Well done team.\n\n191#Cookiebot Live on Workhuman.com|Cookiebot is live on Workhuman.com! A great team effort & continuous problem solving to get Cookiebot live.  Thanks for attending all the meetings, investigation on Cookie ownership, tagging etc.   Looking forward to continue to work with you with the rollout across the other domains.\n\n192#Helping the Dedicated SRM TEAM!|Many Thanks Oragh and Dermot for a great session today. We asked for your help and you jumped straight in without hesitation.  Taking us through your Infosec questionnaire & process for onboarding partners has increased our understanding greatly. SRM really found the session of great benefit and is is certainly reassuring to know that we at Workhuman, our customers and Partners data is in very safe & experienced hands.  Thank you for the session and for keeping us all secure !\n\n193#Thanks and Goodbye for now|As you already know, this is my last week as Director of Platform Engineering at Workhuman. I want to drop a heartfelt thank-you--note to this group. If you're reading this, it's because you were an integral part of any success, that I was part of, during the last year. You all helped me onboard quickly, and make sure I had what was needed to bring Platform Engineering one step up. It was a pleasure to learn so much from this group, from the positive can-do attitude and the camaraderie amongst peers.  It's been great working together, and I wish you lots more success in \"creating a more human workplace\".\n\n194#IBM Security Confidence|Orlagh, that you for your attention support on the recent security discussions with IBM.  When a potentially significant issue was raised, you jumped in and gathered the team, got the information and led calls with IBM.  Your presence on the call demonstrated confidence and affirmed the urgency that the customer required.  You reassured the customer and allowed us to come to a mutually agreeable set of actions.  Thank you for your partnership and customer mindset.\n\n195#Pfizer - One for the Record Books!!!|They say it takes a village and looking at this selling team, that statement could not be more accurate.  This $25M win at Pfizer is one of the largest in Workhuman’s history and has so many implications considering the current global context. Our discussions with Pfizer began back in 2007, making this 15 years’ worth of deposits.  Anyone that participated in and of those meetings played a role in this win. That said, when Alex Paz took this account over in the summer, he was intent on moving these discussions into actions.  He took the proverbial bull by the horns and aligned the perfect team to move this forward.  It began with a tight RFP response and custom demo and content, thanks to Michael, Anna and Amanda.  That led to finalist pitches, where Marcy delivered customer-focused insight that only she can.  Alex then brought Joyce, Matt and Rich to the dance to relay our Merck and AZ stories, which became our primary win theme.  And Orlagh delivered all the assurance Pfizer needed from an IT standpoint and Dan & Matt supported us on the product/integration side.  Once we were selected, Chris helped Alex and I align the commercial terms and then the real fun started.  Hillary expertly navigated one of the strangest contracting processes you will ever see, where procurement negotiated the entire agreement.  Julia also pinch hit at the end to iron out some MSA terms.  Thank you!  As we move to launch success, a special thank you to Amy for her leadership and support along the way. This entire team should be incredibly proud not only for the impact this will have on Workhuman, but also for the difference it will make for the 80,000 Pfizer colleagues who are also doing amazing, life changing work.  Let’s enjoy this one for a bit!!\n\n196#No need to DIY!|Team Ingka - I wanted to recognise you all for your significant contributions to the Ingka presentation on Monday. Everyone played their part to perfection, even when we got a few curveballs from the folks in Sweden! It was a pleasure to partner with you all, and I must particularly shout out Rob for jumping on a call on Sunday to help me think through a few things. I felt super confident knowing I had such a great team alongside me....thank you all!\n\n197#Supporting our Customers|Orlagh, thank you for all the responses on vulnerability questions in December & January. The specific queries raised were critical for our customers as they assessed the risks involved & your timely responses on a variety of queries were much appreciated including when you were on holidays, still customer focused!  I would also like to thank you for joining our team call yesterday and speaking about the most recent security concerns raised by customers and the work undertaken to address these. It's helpful for us to understand the context, the seriousness and the steps required to address this & your support is integral to keeping our customers informed and satisfied.\n\n198#Ensono - Let's Goooo!|Team - I can’t thank you each enough for the role you played in getting Ensono across the line! Robbie - thank you for helping me build a great relationship with Ensono’s CHRO, Meredith, early on and role playing each scenario before our calls. She trusted us enough to give a demo to all 2,600 employees before the contract was even signed! Omar - thank you for all the thoughtful work you put into building the good, better, best investment scenarios and helping Meredith build a business case to secure a healthy investment per employee. Michael and Orlagh - thank you for all the time you spent completing and reviewing Ensono’s security questionnaire, which had over 1,500 questions! Hillary - thank you for all the early morning legal calls and contract revisions as we were coordinating schedules with their legal counsel in India. You are all rockstars and I couldn’t be more grateful to work with each of you!!!\n\n199#Security Star|Orlagh, What a fantastic year the security team have had in 2021!! Under your steadfast leadership and vision you’ve not only brought us to ISO27001 certification but decided to top that off with pushing us to NIST 3.0 to boot. We now consistently measure higher on independent 3rd-party security benchmarks than both Workday and Salesforce. I thank you for all you do to keep us at the top of our game and I look forward to seeing where you and your growing team will take us in 2022. Outstanding Work!\n\n200#With gratitude for this amazing team|In what has been a difficult year on so many levels for so many of us, our Technology team surprised and delighted with the delivery of some huge initiatives this year. The migration of our entire infrastructure to AWS, launch of our Data Lake, go live of our largest ever Recognition and Conversations launches with Accenture & IBM, ISO27001 Certification & Terra Design system rollout to name but a few. Without the tireless resolve and dedication of the entire Technology team these momentous achievements would not have been possible. It’s with great pride in the amazing team we have and belief in the opportunities that lie ahead for Workhuman that I look forward to 2022. Jonathan\n\n201#Thank you!|Merry Christmas InfoSec Team! Just wanted to take the time to say a big thank you to you all. I've learned so much from each of you during the past three months, and I can't wait to learn more in 2022. Hope you all have a fabulous Christmas and New Years with your families, and enjoy your rewards - Robyn :)\n\n202#Collaboration always bring the best results|Thank you for your help on the process verification of employees. This process has risk associated and your advice is essential and much appreciated. Its so good to count on your availability to collaborate with us. More process restructure to come but this first step was urgent and its now completed, so Thank You!\n\n203#ISO training refresh|Orlagh - thanks so much for your help in finishing off the first phase of our new ISO27001 training. Without your help it would have been a near impossible task to  distilling down the standard  into a meaningful and relatable document to hand off for the next part of the process.  All this while dealing with one of the internets most widespread security vulnerabilities !\n\n204#Amazing TEAMWORK- welcome EmblemHealth!|Thank you for being part of this EXTRAORDINARY team that worked hard to stand out & above competition, walk hand in hand w/ EmblemHealth through: their RFP process, very arduous security assessment, Finalist/Finalist/Finalist pitches & contracting reviews to officially get contract documents signed today! Emily, thank you for working diligently to get EmblemHealth's MNDA approved & signed- great first impression when we turn client contract documents requests around quickly! Amanda, the EmblemHealth team loved our Zoom backgrounds- just one of the many examples of how we differentiated ourselves! Anna & Michael, thank you for all of the work & support during the RFP process- & follow-up afterwards!  Orlagh, thank you for answering the 1,000+ security questions & passing the IT security audit! Mike, thank you for your partnership during the Finalist pitches!  Omar, I SO appreciate your time, the effort & encouragement you provided throughout the entire presentations & demos course since we were fortunate to have multiple Finalist pitches!   Dave, thank you for leading the Value Creation Workshop with Joe & Adele- it really helped us get the investment validated  & open to even a greater investment in the future!  Christie, thank you for starting the initial contract package review!  Julia & Hillary, thank you both for partnering together to join the client/Legal meetings, reviewing/editing/offering approved language that allowed us to get all of the contract documents signed! Rich, thank you for meeting with the LOBs to get a jump start on employee data specs, SSO & branding! John, I truly appreciate all of the 1,000s of things you did to support me since May 5th from client intros, the RFP, meetings, finalist pitches & demos, contracting- all the way through to contract signature- THANK YOU! ALL, I am most grateful for YOU and your contributions to bring another new prospective client to the WH family!\n\n205#Snap of a finger! Orlagh to the rescue!|Thank you so much for being there, when I have had so many questions on GDPR and my prospects were not shy on what they needed and when. You literally were there \"Snap of a finger\" on calls and answering emails. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your quick responses.\n\n206#Well above the normal|Folks, We often face supplier issues with codes delivered that impact our customers but in the case of BOL.com thos one was out of the park. Late even calls, weekend worked and so many emails, team messages & skype calls which happily at this stage I can't begin to count. We had a big issue which impacted hundreds of customers and forced us to remove the offering from the sites. Everyone came together to share previous knowledge and experience on getting this resolved in super quick time.  Thanks again to everyone on the team for the help and patience as we found a solution. And finally we received the credit back for 60K in codes impacted.\n\n207#The rock solid team for Prudential RFP|James and Orlagh - thanks for stepping up and into the IT Security document for the RFP Michael, Anna, and Mark - thanks for helping us craft a quality response to the business and technical requirements portion. Lucy, Owen, and Chris - the tailored video was spot on for the storyboard and the visuals you brought in are bound to make a positive impression. And Naomi, my partner in crime from the SA team, thanks for your collaboration and customer-first eye on the presentation deck.\n\n208#excellent job on Urgent request|I need to refresh social network analysis for WorkHuman with newest award text message. Although I have submitted a ticket one week ago, I have not gotten the data. it might be related to holiday week.  therefore, I have sent an email to Enda and Orlagh to get their help to pull the data for me because this analysis has deadline on Dec 2.  They are very quickly response to my request and send me the data this morning! This award is to my appreciation for them to quickly response my urgent request! thank you very much!\n\n209#Bring in 1M deal in Mid-Market!|Thank you to this entire group for helping us close our largest Mid-Market client to date!   It all started thanks to you Eileen! Your relationship with Susan while she was a Bechtel, had her call you directly to kick off this discussion.  You and Dave rocked that first meeting with their CHRO and that foundational relationship paved the way for us to have tough discussions w/ Realtor, understand the competition and what it took for us to win the deal!    Dave your expertise and tools helped us secure the 1% of payroll and drive towards such a healthy IPE ( $555).  You also helped along the way with strategy and critical discussions.   Jenna and Chris, one of the critical pieces of this deal was a partnership with their SWAG vendor.  Although you had built a relationship with 2 new partners you were willing to evaluate and ultimately successfully agreed to partner w/ Brand Fuel (their selected vendor).   Michael and Orlagh, their IT security review was multifaceted and no easy task, piled onto MULTIPLE other deals/assessments you were running and believe deadlines were in the midst of PTO.    Emily and Julia, surprisingly even with the size of this deal it wasn't our most painful negotiation, but it required some creative work and the use of our new OF.  Lastly Chris and Tom, thank you!  This was a unique approach to bookings and having a MM client commit to an upfront purchase and annual investment to allow us to extend discounts and capture the bookings.   I am grateful for all of your help in bringing in this deal.  It's a great win for the Mid-Market team and an amazing logo for Workhuman. As well as bringing former clients back to the Workhuman family.   THANK YOU\n\n210#Dream Team|Team, I cannot fully express the appreciation I have for all of you in under 2,000 characters, so bear with me as I give this my best shot (no pun intended). You each played a critical role in bringing this deal to life well before my time at Workhuman. It was a rollercoaster ride as many of the greatest achievements are- full of stops, starts and left turns (hello redlines and 3rd party privacy reviews).  When I walked into this deal a year ago, I had the confidence of knowing this team had my back. Whatever was needed at any moment, you were there. Executive sponsor calls, 7:30am legal reviews, IT security fire drill emails, you name it- we faced it.   I am so proud of this deal. I am so proud to work for a company that provides this level of collaboration and support throughout a sales cycle.   When I look back at my career highlight reel, this is at the very top and I have YOU, my dream team to thank for this accomplishment.\n\n211#Sales support on a moment’s notice|Thank you for supporting us on short notice for a follow-up Pfizer call. You kept our streak going of bringing them credible and knowlegeable resources to show our depth and breadth of experience and expertise. This time it was integrations, IT Security and Compliance and Launch Success.\n\n212#Security Superstars|Orlagh and Michael, I can't thank you enough for the quick response to Becton Dickinson's last-minute security questions. This client is about to launch, and their InfoSec team came out of nowhere asking very detailed questions about our organization, infrastructure, and application details. You were kind enough to help me with this request so that it doesn't negatively impact the launch timing of this client, which the Program Manager and I very much appreciate!\n\n213#WPP Finalist Pitch|A huge thanks to everyone in the WPP pitch team! As ever, there was a lot of planning and preparation prior to the pitch. Despite agenda details only being confirmed a few days before the meeting and some significant last minute changes to our deck & time allocation, everyone delivered flawlessly! A special mention to Rob, who did an outstanding job presenting WHiQ's content, so much so, that the Group Head of Reward said: \"Ooh, I could listen to Rob all day!\"...reactions don't get much better than that :-)...Thanks to everyone and fingers crossed for the next steps!\n\n214#It’s ELECTRIC (boogie-woogie-woogie)|My 7-year-old self often wondered why I was made to do the Electric Boogie (a.k.a. “the electric slide”) in first grade gym class. Why were they making me do this? Who is singing this song? Why are we dancing in a line? When will this knowledge ever be useful to me? Well now i have the answer to at least some of those questions… A huge thank you to everyone who participated in putting together the Schneider Electric renewal proposal – it was a lot of hard work, but the results were electr— (well, you get the idea!)\n\n215#1,000 security questions and 38 surveys!?!?|Orlagh and Michael,    Thank you for making all of the time to review and respond to EmblemHealth's 1,000+ security audit questions and submit the required surveys and documents on the Prevalent platform.  If that is not extraordinary in itself- it was done, 1 question at a time without capability to advance and review all requirements upfront.  There was a tight turnaround and I cannot thank you enough for all of the time and effort you put in to responding to all of the questions, submitting the surveys and providing all of the necessary documentation on the day that it was due.  You are AWESOME!!!  Thank you again!!!\n\n216#Working your magic with Accenture|Orlagh, this is a ridiculously overdue THANK YOU however better late than never... A few weeks out from UAT we got an unexpected note from Accenture stating that they would not be able to launch their recognition program until we had completed out work on a number of upgrades (some very complex, some not even that sensible!) which had been suggested on a BSI report. While some of us were scurrying around working out how to turbo boost the work that had already been ongoing relating to some of these items, you calmly outlined the reasons to Accenture why these issues were much less urgent to address then they first imagined - first by email and then on a call. And they agreed! And while I call it magic in the award title, it's really about your deep domain expertise and your communication skills. Thank you for stepping in at a key time and simplifying this part of the launch process for us - it's been a huge help.\n\n217#Women Leaders at Workhuman panel|Thank you all for participating in the Women Leaders at Workhuman panel. You all brought your unique experience, expertise, and stories to this discussion. Thank you for your authenticity, candor and inspiration. I appreciate how thoughtful you were around elevating other female leaders across the company and the preparation you put into this session during a busy time. Here are just a few of the comments we saw in the chat, ”Inspirational discussion” “Amazing session… thanks for sharing your experiences” “What a panel! Smart, savvy, practical and real! No condescension, no platitudes, no cute, just straight-up strong leadership.” Incredible job, incredible leadership. Thanks again.\n\n218#Knowledge sharing|Having had a call with Orlagh, in my second week with the company, the welcome received as well as the insights into all things infosec was very beneficial. This will help me immensely in my role and help protect our customers also. thank you.\n\n219#Q3 Mid-Market Success - breaking $1M|In July MM forecasted 600K (representing 60% of the value SMB closed 2020 and 2019)... Yesterday we had closed 700K, 9 New clients. 2 FULL WH Cloud deals. 3 Investing 1% of Payroll.  Then late last night we closed 1 more deal, 300K breaking the 1M barrier!   The list is long, please bear with me;  Judith, you are ALWAYS there when we need you!   Answering urgent questions, hoping on client calls, even helping us start design and program structure discussions while we worked through closing.  Let's not forget you bring all these clients to life!!!  Dave, the larger investments are all thanks to YOU! You relationship w/ Adriene heavily influenced our last win to close & invest 300K (for 300ee)!   Over the last year you've been a partner, challenge us to be better and grow.   Michael & Orlagh, we are continually coming to you as MANY of these customers require security assessments, risk questionnaires etc.   Julia and Emily, you've been patient and helped us win. We aim to minimize redlines to contracts, yet when needed you've been crucial to our success.     Julia last night you worked past 10pm to help us get this last deal done, which meant a lot to Lauren & I, as well as the whole team to hit this major milestone.   Jen your connections continue to pay off.  You are TRULY a fabric of the community.  Making intros, taking calls/meetings & setting us up for success.   Chris, Tom & Jason your continual support to our growth. At times there's tension as we negotiate these deals, securing pricing &terms we haven't historically extended.  That flexibility is giving us room to grow!  Dan there have been sandboxes, tech discussions and your help with our new demo site.   Ro demos and videos have helped us grow our CONV client base and differentiate us from the competition.   Andrew, Bash, Jamie & Erik you work every day has led to this success. Lauren you worked till the final hour pushing to bring deals in!  THANK YOU ALL!\n\n220#Workhuman Credibility Builders|Team - thank you so much for joining the East sales team with little notice this week as we work to bring a new customer on board.  The stakeholders at this future customer had concerns that were holding up our contract process and you each jumped in to set their minds at ease.  Rich - you led the discussion and made sure that the stakeholder team knew they are partnering with the leader and that we have a proven process that will not let them down.  Ger - you confidently addressed their every SSO concern.  Orlagh - you reinforced the robustness of our Info Sec infrastructure and Amy provided the leadership and experience that proved our commitment.  You each left no doubt that the partnership will be a successful one.  Thanks for your time, urgency, and expertise!\n\n221#Fast Faster Fastest!!!|I couldn't write this message fast enough, as my appreciation for your urgency is as high as it gets.  Sometimes we get requests from our future customers that aren't always easy or realistic in nature.  When that happens, it's reassuring to know we have teammates like both of you Michael and Orlagh that can rise to the occasion of the ask.  Thank you both for completing in record time the security assessment for Robert Half, it means a lot!  I hope we'll be able to add this one to the list soon...transitioning from future customer to customer 🙏🏼\n\n222#Security Assessments on Tight Deadlines!|Michael - Even while on vacation you were able to help make sure the security assessments I submitted were completed on time! Liam & Orlagh - I had 2 security assessments that needed to be completed on VERY TIGHT deadlines! You both were so responsive and promised they would get done on time or EARLY! Even with a lot of other requests in line! Thanks for all you do to help the sales team!\n\n223#Intro to InfoSec|Hi all - just wanted to say thanks for all your help over the past few weeks while starting my role in InfoSec. There is an absolutely mind-boggling amount of information to learn, but you have all been so patient and encouraging while I try figure it all out (I promise I'll stop asking the same questions over and over...eventually!). Looking forward to continuing to learn from you all. Enjoy your awards :)\n\n224#Apollo Extra Effort!|James & Orlagh, thanks so much for your extra effort and expediency getting the vendor documents completed for Apollo.  61 questions is no easy lift and you made it look easy.  The partnership is very much appreciated!!\n\n225#Answers Zoomed across|Thank you Dante, Orlagh and Ray for the immediate answers to the questions about Customer Zoom issues.\n\n226#IBM/Kyndryl Data Migration|Thank you so much to each of you for making yourselves available at very short notice for an early morning call to work through options for new requirements from IBM/Kyndryl around their data migration, ahead of a customer call today. You enabled us to reassure our customer's confidence in how the data migration can be validated to their satisfaction. Antonio, this was one of many such calls/interactions out of hours. Appreciate your support!\n\n227#Security Expertise|Orlagh, many thanks for prioritising the third party assessment on the recent vendor. You understood and supported the quick turnaround to get this vendor onboarded, they are key partners for major projects in the people space. Your knowledge and advice on these matters is always appreciated\n\n228#To my amazing Novartis pitch masters!|Thank you all so very much for your excellent contributions on Tuesday!   The feedback so far has been very positive in that Imam and Valentin are looking for a pricing call next week and Niamh/Alex are meeting with Ro and I re Conversations next Tuesday!   To Derek, thanks for setting the tone perfectly at the start and later on when you shared the importance of truly working human; to Emily for not only contributing some of her vacation time, but for also succinctly calling out their priorities and how WH is THE partner to meet those needs; to Naomi for so eloquently showing them how we’ve been doing this for their peers since 1999 and how we will do it for them also, given the chance; to Hari, for not only getting up at crazy o’clock, but also for absolutely nailing the Demo (and piquing Niamh & Alex’s interest in Conversations into the bargain!); to Sarah for not only also contributing her vacation time, but for also exciting and engaging them in our Store experiences; to Meisha-Ann for opening their eyes to the amazingly insightful analytics uniquely available from WH; to Mark, Dante & Orlagh for showcasing our Solution Architecture, Integration Capabilities, System Infrastructure & Information Security Controls; to Jim for showing them how (unlike their current provider) we will absolutely meet their Customer Service & Operational SLA’s globally; to Chris for outlining our Pricing options to them - more of that to follow next week!; and finally to Grant for your insightful contributions throughout AND for answering the vast majority of the Chat questions as the meeting progressed.      It really does take a team of pitch masters to pull off a presentation like we delivered on Tuesday, and I truly know how lucky I am to have all of you as my collaborators in this regard – thank you all so much for all your time, preparation and delivery – onwards and upwards with this massive opportunity!\n\n229#Supporting the Identity release onto Spark|Thank you all so much for your help and expertise in supporting the Spark Release onto Identity. This is a very significant milestone, and you all played an important role in getting us live. Thank you.\n\n230#O is for Outstanding and [almost] Omniscient|Orlagh, in the states we have the Big O, a great basketball player named Oscar Robertson. But in Ireland (and Workhuman) we have a Big O too - Orlagh Lynch! Oscar was a 12-time all star and a master of versatility. Time and time again, when common and obtuse security questions confront me and I need to call on an all-star, I call on you. Your versatility - from leading our ISO certification and all of our InfoSec activities to responding to the mundane and modish questions we get asked - is legend. On top of all that, you do it with self deprecation and good cheer. Thank you Orlagh, you are part of the initial class in the Proposal team hall of fame.\n\n231#Accenture!|So Accenture is signed! What a journey, and what a privilege! To be the provider to one of the world's most important consultancies. Accenture provide advice to half the world on how to run their businesses. I can't wait to have half a million Accenture employees knowing the power of Social Recognition!  A wide range of incredibly talented people worked for many years to get us to this point. There were many stops and starts. Some would say we won it a few times in the past, only for the deal to not get across the line. Not this time. Now it's a done deal, with the ink now dried on the contract.  From the early work of planting seeds, over many years, to the acceleration this year - the conference room pilot, the endless brainstorming, demoing, and contract negotiations - we always kept our eye on the prize.   Congratulations to John, Tom and Grant, who more than any shepherded this deal to a conclusion. But they couldn't have done it without a village of people - this award goes to more than thirty people!  Thank you all, an incredible testament to team work and the Workhuman value of Determination!\n\n232#Dover Corp InfoSec Assist|Orlagh, thank you so much for your tremendous work on Dover Corporation! Dover Corp came to having already signed the contract, but with a new Chief Insecurity Officer who was eager to put his \"stamp\" on the project. After several meetings and reviews of the documentation we provided, we landed on a call with them where they sent a barrage of questions your way on data retention, encryption policies, GDPR compliance, SOC Certification, ISO certification and everything in between. With less than six weeks to launch, this could have easily derailed the project, but your willingness to meet with them (twice!) answer (and re-answer!) their question, document our processes and meet them where they were made all the difference. Thank you so much for your patience and determination in tackling these meetings with me. We've confirmed with them now that we are all systems a go to our July launch time frame and both me (and our project manager at Dover Corp!) are so thankful to you for getting us there! THANK YOU!\n\n233#Winning Industry Mentor for Women Reboot|Orlagh, you've been mentoring a team of Women Reboot over these past weeks, and your team today won the Innovation Pitch. They were phenomenal and I could see your support and encouragement coming through at every phase of their innovation pitch. Thank you for your commitment to this programme and your professional  and personal support of the women as they step back into technology. What a role model!!\n\n234#Quite the *learning* journey!|Team, I can't thank you all enough for your efforts throughout this deal! Thank you, Orlagh and Michael, for a speedy response with the security assessment, really made the process easy for our new customer. Sylvain, I can't thank you enough for the endless hours you put in, from sending contract emails at 9 pm to contract and pricing negotiations. Coursera came back with a mediocre investment level after discussing best practices. You provided instant value by shifting their thought about what a healthy investment looked like and doubled the deal size!! Thank you, Chris, for helping out with the financial side of the deal by providing us with a strong incentive that helped us push this through the finish line. Judith, thank you for scheduling times with us to discuss customer handoff as we waited for the contract. The Coursera team is excited to get the ball rolling and get their new recognition program live! Legal... I don't even know where to begin. I must say, Coursera was a tough cookie to crack, but you stayed persistent and adamant about holding the line on our MSA. Every time we thought we agreed on terms, they would come back with yet, another red line. You were instrumental in this whole process. Without you, we wouldn't be here celebrating this amazing win! I learned so much from this sales process, and it took me through a rollercoaster of emotions. Coursera wasn't lying when they say they are in the business of teaching others. I'm incredibly grateful for all of you, and I look forward to many more wins as a team!\n\n235#We did it!|Looking back team it took us exactly 3 1/2 months and 7 meetings to close TDECU and I couldn't have done it without the support and guidance from each and every one of you! Jamie initially fielded the demo request and got it over to me at lightning speed! In comes Sylvan and Chris when the deal got competitive and they kept asking \"can you do better on price?\" We got real crafty with pricing because they wanted Social Recognition as well as the Celebrations Bundle. Not to mention they disclosed they will be investing half a percent of payroll ($265k annually)! Thank you Chris for humoring us as we tried to navigate the pricing discussions to beat out Kazoo. Sylvain - You were the voice of reason throughout those 3 1/2 months. You kept me calm and told me not to panic when we couldn't gauge if our pricing proposal was strong enough. You also hopped on many of my calls with the team, but also made a point to have a conversation with their VP of TR to make sure we were all aligned. In the final call with the VP of TR you shared our differentiators against Kazoo to solidify that we are the better partner. Having you as an executive sponsor and involved early on really helped to keep this deal moving. I can't forget about Michael and Orlagh! At the drop of a dime, I told you we have to have this security assessment completed by May 14th. You both quickly hopped into their (confusing) vendor assessment portal. We passed with flying colors. Thank you for your speedy turnaround time. In comes, Julia and Emily, helping us iron out all the redlines on the Order Form and MNDA. Emily thank you for being so patient when I said, \"OK we are good to send via Docusign and 20 minutes later my contact said JUST KIDDING.\" Thank you to the team for helping me add another Credit Union into the Workhuman Family!\n\n236#Closing Out Dell's Vendor Audit|Doug, Liam, Nick, Megan, Sarah, Orlagh, and Kara - the dedication, tenacity, and patience you've displayed during these last few months while working on Dell's audit has been astounding. While I can't imagine any audit is riveting, Dell's audit has been especially tedious. The specificity of their requests was intense - covering data retention and classification, methods of transmission of Dell data to/from Workhuman, contract management, employee onboarding, employee access to Dell data, and call recordings. No stone was left unturned. Thank you for going above and beyond on countless occasions to address all of Dell's requests. Talk about perseverance!\n\n237#Friday evening meeting....|Thanks all for attending and contributing to a vey useful meeting late on a Friday evening, after a long week your dedication to stay the course was much appreciated.\n\n238#Thank you chefs!|Thank you all for contributing your meat free recipes for Earth Week! It was fantastic to see these gathered together into a beautiful e-book and shared with our fellow humans!\n\n239#ISO27001 Stage 1 Audit|My sincere thanks for all the leadership and dedication you have displayed during the long road that is ISO27001 certification. Although we are only half way there, it is down to your devotion and energy that we passed our Stage 1 audit. This is a significant milestone for us and I look forward to achieving the ultimate goal with you in the driver seat. Thanks for all your efforts on this important initiative.\n\n240#I'd Like to Make a Transfer Please...|As I share my gratitude with this amazing team, just know we will forever be bonded, given this is the first new customer I’ve had the pleasure of welcoming to the Workhuman family.  Vahagn, your early engagement with Russ and Marie allowed us to have our first meeting with Western Union, which took place exactly 1 year ago today (as I write this note).    Michael & James, your attention to detail helped pave the way to get us moving in the right direction.  Hari, this one got started as I was still finding my way.  We spent countless hours together preparing for discovery, demo’s, follow up meetings, finalist presentations and so much more.    Naomi, you helped provide the confidence that we would be with them every step of the way and make sure they are set up for success.  Dan, Brian, Geoff, Kevin & Brian, the custom demo dream team!  You found workarounds for my requests that included embedding a YOS video created for the VP, Total Rewards…which she loved.  Meisha-ann, did you say ROI?  Having you share the kind of impact we have on so many customers is nothing short of amazing!    Marc, even though your arrival came towards the tail end of the process, you helped navigate strategy through the home stretch.  Chris, you were open minded and helped us craft a winning financial strategy to get this deal completed.  Orlagh, you made the security and privacy discussion smoother then a fresh shave with a new razor.    Julia, I’m bummed it took as long as it did for me to get to witness your brilliance.  We need to get you a Workhuman cape!  Tom,  you were both challenging and supportive throughout the process.  You made me better and we earned a new customer in Western Union.  We have the best team from top to bottom, and I can’t thank you enough for all your contributions!!!\n\n241#True Partners|Hillary and Orlagh, thank you both so much for taking the time to attend our strategy meeting with LeadMD on our GDPR solution. Hillary, you were able to attend this meeting as an additional team member was on PTO. Orlagh, you attended this meeting even though this was outside your working hours. Thank you both for being so flexible with your calendars and providing the insight we needed in this strategy meeting to move the project along. I truly appreciate your support for this initiative! Thanks team!\n\n242#Making Time for our Customers|Orlagh, I can't thank you enough for adjusting your schedule to accommodate a customer in launch.  Not only do we have extreme time zone differences, and a contact who is available only two days a week, but this customer requested your time with very little notice or flexibility.  Without this meeting, our launch date could have been jeopardized.  Thank you for putting the customer first. I know how busy you can be and really appreciate your help in keeping this launch on schedule!\n\n243#Awesome All-Hands|Great work by you all with your excellent presentations at our All Hands and Thanks for coming together so well as a team to define, plan, scope and deliver a compelling, topical and relevant session that was both professionally executed and engaging. My Thanks also for your assistance in shaping the event and providing your guidance and flair in the production of the flow and slide design. Great Event, Well Done All!\n\n244#Risk Assessment|A massive thank you for your help in completing AstraZeneca's recent Risk Assessment process. It was a heavy lift for sure and we were up against some very tight timelines. Thanks for finding time to work through the many many questions they needed answers to, it's greatly appreciated!\n\n245#Respect for Teamwork|Thank you for all your help in making the Atlassian migration successfully.  From testing , finance, creating scripts, legal , security and many more without your help we would not have made the migration to the cloud platform\n\n246#Helping Keep Vitesco's Launch on Track|I can't thank you both enough for your attention and work on the Vitesco cybersecurity questionnaire. The client came to us at the last minute with a survey required for launch and you both addressed it very quickly and communicated with me throughout each step. I can imagine that this was a hectic week for the security team and RFP teams, and this type of urgency is very much appreciated! Thank you so much for prioritizing this request and taking time out of your busy schedules to help the client.\n\n247#\"Going Further Together\" with Hartmann|To my amazing Hartmann pitch team colleagues - thank you all so much for your individual contributions to what was I think a really god overall team performance today - which I think was very nicely  summed up by Sven at the end of the pitch where he said if they already had our program he would be giving us all awards for the pres!  He also said it was very obvious were how customer centric we all were - high praise indeed!  Still a good bit to go, including with Procurement etc to get this over the line, but thanks a mill to you all for your critical contributions to this really important step along the way today...\n\n248#Taking the Risk Out of Takeda|A big THANK YOU to all of you for making it a priority to get the Takeda Risk Assessment done and dusted so quickly.  I know it was due on a Sunday of all things and Orlagh, you made it a priority to wrap it up over the weekend to make it on time.  The three of you worked together with a million other priorities on your plate and I sure appreciate it.  Way to go team!\n\n"
"249#DXC Ya Later!|Chris and Team, congrats on a tremendous win at DXC.  Selling a deal one time is hard enough, but getting an e-thanks only client to add points is another \"unique\" adventure to say the least.  This client expansion from non-monetary to a $5M budget, certainly began with building a vision with DXC over the years (I think it may be 8 years to be exact).  Chris you found a way to stay resilient through the ups and downs (with support from Tim G), built great relationships within the account and sold the business value of our solution which made all of the difference.  Thanks Rob S for supporting us and helping us differentiate along the way. We also had incredible support from the client team (thanks Joyce) and launch (Rich, Liz and of course Amy) who delivered a successful experience during the e-thanks deployment, ensuring DXC was confident in moving to a monetary program.  And as most complex deals often do, they get a bit tricky there at the end and our team rose to the challenge.  Orlagh provided everything we needed to from an IT stand-point, which is never easy when dealing with a global technology company.  Julia, can't say enough about your continued partnership and this is another great example of strong sales/legal alignment.  Thank you!  Jen and Chris O'Sullivan, you both stepped up to help support DXC with some questions related to grossing up, which further solidified us as a strong long-term partner.  And of course, Tom V your guidance and involvement with this deal from the very beginning is worthy of a big thank you!  This win truly brought out the best in us, across so many parts of Workhuman, as we secured another impressive logo.  You all should be proud....enjoy!!\n\n250#ISO|Hi Guys, I would like to thank you for the invite to the ISO refresher presentation, it meant a lot. I found it very informative and it was good to get an overview of what will be an important milestone in the history of our company. Thanks and enjoy!\n\n251#ISO 27001 Comms Kickoff|Orlagh, many thanks for looping comms in on the work underway for ISO 27001 Certification. Our first team discussion was super informative and it was great collaborating with you on the messaging for Eric to share at the company check in. I appreciate your quick review and fine tuning of the message to ensure we got it right for him to share. I know this is just the start, but I wanted to thank you for your work on this first big step with the comms.\n\n252#Onboarding Heroes|Hi Michael, Amanda, Casey, Orlagh, Eileen, Mark, Dave, Cam, and Rick! I want to thank you for making time during the past few weeks to participate in my onboarding process for the new Sales & Customer Success Enablement Strategist role. I'm look forward to working closely with you on our customer renewal and YOS / symbolic awards efforts. Thank you again for sharing your expertise to help me transition into this exciting new position! James\n\n253#Cinderella Story. It's in the hole!!|To the crew that helped bring Acushnet through a journey to executing contracts!  Thank you for being great teammates! Andrew, you helped open a door for me back in 2019 with their new CHRO and we worked together to secure an onsite meeting with him before he met with his entire team! Marcy, my Wonder Twin (The Cool Wonder Twin) you were with me the majority of this journey bringing value to our strategy, demo, customer success and change management.  Even taking over an on-site meeting without skipping a beat because something got caught in my throat and had to leave the room to get myself back to neutral.  Just add it to the list of funny things we reminisce about!  Our meeting strategy and value proposition was a key reason why they did not go to RFP and went to VOC with us! John and Michael, I appreciate your leadership as we had to navigate some high winds on the back nine.  The pandemic made them close their doors for 50 business days.  Patience can be hard at times but, it was worth it!! Michael Robb and Orlagh, thank you for your tremendous work on the IT/Security review.  We only needed one additional call that Orlagh was so gracious on accepting the time because it was at 8pm her time on a Friday night!  Dedication and respect for customers to say the least! Julia, thank you for working through the contracts.  You made it look easy with only one round of redlines!! Awesome win by this team!  Green jackets for everyone! Cheers! (or should I say FORE!)\n\n254#collaboration makes the world go around|Orlagh,  Matt,  thank you both for being amazing collaboration partners on the recent device management platform project.  Orlagh you brought sponsorship, a wealth of knowledge and advice,  a clear head of sense that always gave pause to think about the request and look at it from the technical control aspect and from the users point of view.  Matt, you started new to the organization and jumped into the project with both feet.  without knowing the technical setup of the org you got stuck in with suggestions, ideas and best practices brought advice from previous experience and the experience of managing an outside vendor to complete the work required.  You have been a dream-team to work with on this and I look forward to better and more frequent collaboration between our teams in the coming 12 months.\n\n255#Accenture Architectural Review|Mark, Dante, Orlagh and Eddie. Thank you for the high quality work youve put into the Accenture Architecture review. The time you invested in preparing, giving constructive and radically candid feedback to one another and suggesting ideas for how to make it successful, paid off on our call today. We were scrutinised, challenged, and questioned to a high standard by the Accenture CIO team. Their leading executive remarked on the very professional approach to the call from Workhuman. Well done, I’m grateful to be working alongside you.\n\n256#Review process|Thank you Orlagh for arranging the 3rd party review of our internal IT systems and for helping us throughout the process,  it took a lot of your time during course of the last 2 weeks which we all know is like gold dust.  your input, assistance and guidance is key to our success so we really appreciate your time and dedication.\n\n257#Friday night lights|Thank you all for working together to diagnose data security, schema versus partitions and application access controls in support of the sales organisation, who are working on a very significant deal. The responsiveness, the quality of debate, and collaboration on the answer was a joy, and it is my joy to get to work with you all!\n\n258#Hess High Five!|Orlagh, I am proudly going to “Shout Out” from the WH rooftop how grateful I am for your role and expertise on our Hess Finalist Pitch call today!  What was originally scheduled as a 2:15 min call where you would do a VERY brief Q&A as part of the IT questionaire turned into a 2 part- 4 hour total presentation today. Not only did you graciously offer to be involved in the entire finalist pitch (—I am grateful as there were IT questions peppered in) but then we were made aware of a second requested meeting today (not previous scheduled) that required a full 1.5hrs of technical deep dive after business hours in your time zone. You immediately accepted without hesitation versus rescheduling at a better time.  The second call was rapid fire IT - data & security questions that concluded at 11pm in your time zone! You addressed every single question with confidence and professionalism.  I believe this is a perfect example of why Workhuman is the BEST in the business, its because we truly work as a team and I am so proud to have had you as a major part of this one.\n\n259#Checkpoint VPN Client Decommissioning!!|Wanted to thank you all for being proactive, and looking into a last minute notification Checkpoint sent, warning us they would decommission older versions of their VPN client by end of this year.  Peter, Orlagh thanks for the heads up, and for chasing up with this. Darko, Lee thanks for checking on your side that Windows and Macs have the latest Checkpoint VPN client installed, which is not affected.\n\n260#Technology Procurement 2020|Thank you all for the excellent partnership throughout the year to help oversee and improve our technology procurement process.   Over the year,  you have each contributed to improving our technology decision making, while ensuring our ecosystem remains secure by identifying the right partners with the right terms and the right price.   This groups ability to execute on each of these projects, often with tight deadlines,  has been incredible.  We have facilitated over 50 new technology requests last year while managing countless renewals for our existing application portfolio.   This group shows a real desire to partner with all areas of the company to help them identify the quality partners needed to succeed and execute the procurement and integration of these vendors into our ecosystem.  I am incredibly fortunate to partner with you on this,  benefitting immensely from your wisdom and expertise in your areas,  and I look forward to continuing to evolve our process with you all in 2021.\n\n261#Quick Turnaround Time!|Michael & Orlagh, thank you for making yourself available to help with the IT assessment for HashiCorp. We are working hard to get them signed up as a Workhuman customer by the end of the year and because of your amazing teamwork, we are one step closer! Thanks again!\n\n262#With much gratitude !|Thank you for your partnership, you ALWAYS exceed expectations !\n\n263#Supporting the Epicor AWS Migration|I wanted to thank each of you for supporting the migration of Epicor to AWS. It takes many folks to clear the way for a project like this, and this really was a cross-functional feast! Whether it was part of our Executive Steering Group, hands on support for the go-live weekend , or supporting key members of the team, you all played an important part in supporting the team to a successful go-live this past weekend.  Thank you for your continued support and commitment to our wonderful cross-functional team,  its very much appreciated.\n\n264#Achievement Unlocked - PCI Certification|Another year, another PCI audit successfully completed. Thanks to Aleks and David for sourcing the necessary vendor documentation, these are vital components of the certification process. This year was also the first year some of new process changes were in scope so thank you to Brendan, Grant and Peter for your assistance in implementing and validating these changes as well as all your assistance gathering evidence. Orlagh thanks for your support on sourcing and running through or processes and procedures and thanks to Dermot for the numerous deep dives into Nessus.\n\n265#Thank you for your quick action|Thank you for your time and effort recently dealing with the Security and OCS questions relating to the Oracle cloud migration project.  The timing was tight to close which required your urgent assistance but you jumped to the challenge.  Your quick-thinking actions allowed the project move forward. Well done! Tony\n\n266#Leading the charge for our Production data lake|Team! Thanks to the extraordinary efforts over the past few months, and to the courage and leadership you have all shown, we now have a live production data lake. What an amazing journey, from an idea to a full production system. All with a brand new paradigm. And in a brand new technology to boot. This is a perfect example of cross team collaboration. You all showed tremendous courage in embracing the new. We now have a phenomenal new platform on which we can deliver the future of analytics at Workhuman. Thank you all.\n\n267#Coming through for Version 1!|Thank you for your work and attention around Version 1's Supplier Questionnaire form. This was something that the client missed during the contracting process, and came back to me about during launch. I really appreciate your responsiveness and clarity around this request. As James pointed out, the form is over 100 questions! This goes a long way with helping the HR Program Manager at Version 1. Thank you!\n\n268#First participants in our Influencer training|Thank you for your participation in the first running of the Influencer Model training - your engagement, energy and commitment during the training was incredible.   I really appreciated the open dialogue, the engagement with breakout sessions, and for me to be able to develop the course further - your honest feedback on what worked well and areas of suggested improvements!!  Thank you so much!!\n\n269#P.erfect T.eam C.ollaboration|Not a typo, I want to thank everyone who was involved in the recent win to gain our newest New England customer; PTC! John, Thank you for being an incredible teammate and coach, helping me navigate and execute on aggressive timeline and challenging conversations.

You were connected to a key member of the evaluation team, your support was imperative to our win. Marcy, Thank you for being part of the \"top 3\" presentation - we brought a unique spin on our presentation that is now a best practice. Naomi, thank you for stepping in towards the end and providing support from an early decision guidance perspective. Orlagh, thank you for your support and willingness to connect with PTC - You always do an incredible job answering questions in a clear and digestible manner. Christie, thank you for your amazing execution and your legal support - You were extremely urgent and thorough. Always offering to meet with us internally and also the PTC team. Amy, thank you for your partnership from a customer onboarding perspective. We voiced that this team is very motivated to get started, you helped us execute a few things to meet with our new customers needs. Scalzi, my partner in crime - thanks for helping in so many different ways, even letting me vent at times. Thank you all - I'm so thrilled for us to gain this new customer. This is an incredible logo to gain and it couldn't be done without the support from each one of you.\n\n270#Thank you!|Thank you both so much for your help to close out a security questionnaire for one of my clients, originally I had thought this was specific to finance but there had been some questions in here that were for your teams,  this didn't reach you both until the last minute -  I appreciate you support when I reached out and thank you for helping me to meet the deadline which was this Monday 6th, especially as it was the holiday weekend last week and I know there are some incredibly important RFP's under way, I appreciate you both very much, thank you again.\n\n271#Great support and partnership|Many thanks Orlagh for all your recent support and collaboration on the international working guidance. What I thought would be a challenge to get over the line ended up being a pretty smooth process. Thanks to your prompt responsiveness we have been able to confirm the details we needed very efficiently. Please know that you have contributed to an important guide that will enable us to support our people and create moments that matter. I appreciate your support and partnership. With much gratitude.\n\n272#Bringing Positivity to ChristianaCare!|Team, We did it! ChristianaCare is one of our newest customers!  This wouldn't be possible without you all bringing your best qualities to this journey.  I appreciate your patience, expertise, strategy and, urgency during a journey that was impacted by delays followed by immediate urgency, significant budget cuts and lack of communication with their business leaders.  I know it tested me a few times. At the end of the day though, we should feel proud about what we have done and what we are going to be able to do for CCHS.  We are bringing appreciation, connection and affirmation to people on the front lines that are battling this pandemic.  Putting their lives at risk to care for others then go home and have to isolate from there families for safety reasons. I am proud to be a part of this team that helped bring this to fruition. This would not have happened if I didn't have your quality collaboration and teamwork!  With sincere gratitude! Cheers!\n\n273#It Takes a Village to Start a Trial...|Aidan, Christie, and Orlagh,  I cant thank you enough for all your support in working together to get the Lucidchart Org Chart Trial through our approval process for the sales organization to use.  There is a lot going on right now and it was inspiring to see your dedication and quick attention to getting it through the approval process so it meets all the requirements we ask for.  Through it all, you all kept a great attitude and an open mind and I thank you all for that.\n\n274#LogMeWin Team|What a team! I want to thank each of you for the fantastic role you played in winning the new LogMeIn business. LogMeIn started with Workhuman in early 2017 as a spiff tool for a small group of sales reps and is now signed on to launch a full peer to peer recognition program for all 4000+ employees in 13 countries. There were many small wins along the way that ultimately gave the CEO at LogMeIn the confidence to execute this new contract earlier this week.   John, you were a guiding force during the last two months, and we couldn’t have won this business without your leadership.  Hillary, you showed tremendous knowledge, speed, and creativity working the order forms and MSA. You were able to convert the first SMB to corporate using an “amendment.”  Corinne, your ROI investment discussions with Beth Salamida back in the summer of 2017 were vital in building the foundation of our relationship with the LogMeIn HR team. Beth was able to answer the CEO’s final questions this week.  Orlagh and Michael, you lifted and completed that SIG heavy like it was nothing!  Jamie, you were able to continually make Beth feel special over the last three years with holiday gift baskets, cookies, and tremendous follow up.  Bashir, you were essential in reviving this opportunity earlier this Spring.  Judith, Rachel, and Amy thank you for helping us think through all of the nuances that are involved with going from SMB to corporate. I have a feeling we will be having more conversations about this going forward.  Chris, thank you and your Sam Adams bottle for giving us a transaction fee that worked for both sides!   Mike, you pushed for an executive alignment call and executed it perfectly, which lead to us closing the deal with time to spare!  Thank you all so much!\n\n275#Many roads traveled to get to State Street|6 yrs in the making, but we finally did it - 1 of the premier Fortune 500 FinServ firms in the world & fellow BOS company is now a customer. I vividly remember coming out of one our many early \"we're never selling an audit again\" meetings w/Tom & Brenda debriefing and saying to Tom afterwards \"I didn't know Brenda could swear like that - LOL\"  That set a tone; we definitely had our shares of funny stories on this journey, but in the end it was another amazing team effort. Tim, your partnership along the way was instrumental in us engaging all the right folks in the right way so everyone who was anyone knew our name. Marcy & Rob, my go to 1, 2 punch in adding tremendous value in the form of insight, expertise and confidence. Marcy you gave them your calm I got you covered poise on best practice design & how to prepare for launch (granted there were a handful of ground hog day meetings - \"how about you do what I told you the last 3 calls.\"  Mr. SMEmitter with the ROI calculator &  WDAY expertise setting us apart from Achievers. Orlagh & Michael another doozy of an IT security review w/2 sets of Qs & numerous follow-ups. Orlagh your matter of fact yet confident style had us positioned well even w/a few areas to remediate (one of which being them getting your name correctly). Mr. Cromwell, we had several \"one last\" asks, but each time you partnered with us to find the best win-win solution for both sides (I owe you a couple of craft brews for sure - you can put on Tom's tab).  Hillary, an amazing job navigating the legal process w/them \"using our paper\", but basically incorporating their terms some of which were quite interesting.  And Tom, well there was a moment there when I thought \"well this is it Tom's going to tell this procurement guy to take a hike,\" but as always you found a way to turn an adversary into an ally (we all know who won this Boston throw down).  THANK YOU all!\n\n276#There's no I in Teknor|Team, I want to thank each of you for playing a part in the Teknor Apex deal. This was truly a team effort that needed the expertise each one of you brought to the table. Scalzi, great job working from the inside and setting the tone early. John, you've been an amazing leader and coach. Thank you for helping me navigate this to the finish line. Orlagh, you joined a number of calls and provided so much value to these meetings in the last 2 weeks. Dave and Marcy were amazing additions to an on site meeting held back in Feb, thank you! Hillary and Lauren, thank you for your legal guidance and offering your time to join meetings so we could address outstanding questions. Naomi, thank you for your help late in the meeting with the Germany team, Thank you! Jen, we offered an executive alignment call to keep momentum of the deal and it was another example for Teknor as to why Workhuman is the best partner. Thank you! I appreciate all of you, I'm grateful to work here and with all of you!\n\n277#A big thank you!|Orlagh,   Both myself and Liam would like to say a big thank you for the past few weeks (months? I have no honest idea) and call out how easy you have made the transition to WFH.   Every interaction we've had as a team has focused on the human. In both words and deeds it's obvious that you have put a great deal of thought into making sure that your team are doing well mentally and are comfortable and able to work without worry or discomfort. Every day in our calls before we talk about work you make the effort to ask how we are doing, what we've been up and check in on how people are getting on day to day.   Thank you for making a tough time so much easier!   Dermot and Liam\n\n278#48 Hour Turnaround - WOW!|Michael and Orlagh - I can't thank you enough for the recent work on the State Street 3rd Part Risk Management documents.  We were recently selected as VOC and part of their process required us to comply with their risk assessment protocols.  Given the urgecy of the situation and their desire to be live with a new program ASAP, both of you jumped into action going from start to finish in 48 hours.  Support like this is much appreciated and helps sales to be effective in our roles.  Thank you so much for the effort here!!\n\n279#The Future of Recognition at GAF|What a great team! I appreciate you all coming together to present for GAF as a follow up to their RFP. I believe we put ourselves in an excellent position to win this business. Each of you played a key role and helped elevate the presentation to the next level. Thanks again.\n\n280#Canadian \"Anchor\" Customer - Manulife|Our first engagement dates back June 2016, almost 4 yrs ago.  A sincere THANK YOU to all of you,  for being an integral part in us close an \"Anchor\" customer for Canada (investing 1/2% of payroll in their global recognition program).     Hillary you are absolutely amazing!   Countless hours of grinding this out, helping me stay sane and balancing our efforts. 5am calls with China and daily 7:30am calls with Tom & I, working nights and weekends to review/edit the legal documents to try and expedite the process and meet timelines.  You worked directly with the client's legal resource while I worked with the business.    Over the years the S&C team has been integral to our success.  Rob, Naomi, Marcy, you've given countless hours of advice, presentations and thought leadership.  Helping us paint the picture, creating the business case and securing the deal.  Rob your introduction to Christine R propelled the deal.   Jenn you were always there, giving advice, helping us see the client's perspective, coming onsite to deliver the finalist pitch, and orchestrating resources!    Orlagh, you helped us through security audits and numerous questions/situations I've never encountered in my career.  Recently you held a virtual audit for almost 3 painstaking hours!  Jesse, without you and all the great work your team does behind the scenes (as well as onsite) we wouldn't have the customer stories to have built the business case for investment.   Amy & Lauren you were flexible & patient, bending certain rules to help us balance the customers expectations/requirements as we worked through contracting.   Michael, Jason, Chris F, Chris O, Dan, Grant, Jim D, Jim O, Rick, Sarah, Leslie, Steve & Lauren you all helped with your expertise.  Last but not least, Tom... at times we never thought we'd get it done.  But you pushed and motivated me to get it done never losing faith over the years.    THANK YOU EVERYONE!\n\n281#Network Security Answers at breakneck speed!|Orlagh and Liam, thank you so much for answering so many questions for DXC on all things Security!  I appreciate you both jumping on calls (with over 10 members of their team), being responsive to ask after ask, detail after detail, and Orlagh- I cannot thank you enough for jumping into the redlines with me at a moments notice! Somehow I know this is just part of the saga that will continue but I wanted to take the time to thank you both for your dedication and support !\n\n282#It was a moment!|A huge and sincere T H A N K Y O U to this long list of amazing humans. It seems like an eternity but just a short few weeks ago at the Executive off-site down in Florida, Eric and his team were all seated for a session. Each person was handed a sealed envelope with their name on it. Inside were the private letters each of you wrote. Some vulnerable, some filled with humor but all filled with how that person made you feel. It was a moment! Silence, smiles and even tears. It's not every day you get the chance to silence an entire Executive Team and remind them of how much they also matter and how they have influenced your day, week - or career. Thank you for being at the heart of what made this moment come to life.You all are amazing!  -Rebecca & Alice\n\n283#Orlagh To The Rescue!!|Thanks Orlagh for helping out with various requests and tickets. You're always quick to respond, and give solid advice for better securing our network!\n\n284#Driving towards success together!|There are so many trucking/driving puns we could use here, but at the end of the day you all helped us drive towards success at Day & Ross!   A small deal, but strategic as it's part of a larger opportunity with McCain Foods!  Christie you were extremely helpful throughout the NDA & contracting process.  And in the last week took the wheel and drove us to contract close while I was traveling and focusing on other opportunities.   Rob although you couldn't make the trip to Hartland, you were my partner in crime on this one, helped us develop the ROI, business case, demos to the business and networking with their VP at the HR Awards this past September.    Michael, Orlagh & Dan, in the final hours we needed to overcome some IT questions and challenges.  You were all EXTREMELY responsive and helpful.   Thank you!\n\n285#All systems go!!|Orlagh,   Thank you so much for your help with ensuring that our BCP plan is possible. Given the current environment the business need to ensure preparedness for any eventuality, as a result of this we have been testing out our BCP plans. We had an issue with one of the systems that we have to access whereby it couldn't be accessed offsite. You quickly responded to sort out the issue and we now have access to all relevant systems offsite should the need arise.  Thanks again for your support and efficiency, the team and I really appreciate it.\n\n286#Data Security|Thank you both for spending time with me on explaining the Workhuman data security compliance details on a short notice. It was very informative to me as I am trying to understand the data security and compliance requirements that needs to be met when bringing data into the Cloud (AWS). I know we have only started but found very useful conversation to begin with appreciate giving me your time and valuable input on this. Thanks\n\n287#Thanks for your interview support|Megan & Orlagh, thank you so much for your recent help by being an additional part of our eComm interview panel.  I greatly appreciate you giving up your valuable time to meet with and screen potential candidates for eComm.  Also for your follow up feedback and contribution within the review process.  Both your inputs and insights are invaluable to receive and I really appreciate it.  Thanks again to you both, Rebecca\n\n288#No1 Innovation|The fantastic group 3 - No1 Brainstorming team! 10.30 on a Thursday morning after a Workhuman dinner event may not have been the ideal time to get those brain cells going, but you all rose to the challenge. 5 pages of brainstorming ideas condensed to 5 great ideas to support our clients engaging with their employees to practice gratitude. The engagement of the room at the feedback session really highlighted the innovative ideas you imagined. What a great group pulling together to support 2021 and beyond for Workhuman.\n\n289#Dine around host|Orlagh, I wanted to thank you for hosting a fantastic dine around dinner for our group in IGNITE US, it was my first experience going to dine arounds in the US having heard so much about it! The restaurant was such a good choice and not to mention the food -so good :) I really enjoyed it so thanks again\n\n290#It Takes a Village...|Team, thank you so much for your collaboration, timliness, attention to detail and customer focus in helping answer a host questions pertaining to security, data privacy, GDPR, Works Councils and so much more.  You did so without even knowing that this would expedite the contract process and  help move the opportunity forward with our technology (future) client we are in contracts with.  You managed to carve out time in your busy days to craft responses and then collaborate on the most succinct and accurate response and include all appropriate back up material.  As a result, we over-delivered from a timing perspective and will help us finalize all questions to move forward.  Thank you team!\n\n291#Answering all the IT and security questions|Orlagh & Michael, thank you both for your unwavering support around the Dell IT questionnaire and review that was sent our way.  You have been so helpful in talking through a number of different IT and security questions in a rather complex manner.  You both helped to gain the client's confidence around all of our internal applications and procedures through a rather complex review process.  Also along the way we were able to navigate an audit request they were looking to pursue.  I mean as much fun as SCOP Assessments can be you both made it a wonderful experience for the client and their rigorous security assessment team.  Thank you for your diligence, patience and responsiveness to help with this exercise.\n\n292#GDPR Guidance|Orla, thanks for your guidance and confirmation on a recent infosec query. GDPR can feel like a minefield so it was great to get your expertise and advice.\n\n293#Amazing Partnership|Orlagh thank you so much for your constant and ongoing partnership.  Security vetting is always a huge part of every new client sales process and you always come through like the calvary!  Thanks for being such a great partner.\n\n294#Keeping the bad guys out|Hey guys. Thank you for spotting some odd behaviour on the phone and the fake me (as if such a thing could exist!). Great alertness from Genessa and expertise from Orlagh to alert us to a potential social engineering attack.\n\n295#Next career...  Fire Fighters for Boston FD|At 4PM yesterday a call went out for a 5 Alarm Fire....  Manulife's CIO was skeptical of the Global Recognition Program and requested a meeting with the chosen vendor.     Panic set in within the HR team and.... Workhuman mobilized a great team of experts (or should I say fire figthers!)  With less than 2 business hours to prepare, emails were sent, white papers shared, meetings moved, interviews rescheduled, a 30 min prep meeting scheduled and occurred... and WH Firefigthers were on the scene at 10:15am!    In the end we faced little more than a \"cat stuck in a tree\" emergency, however the citizens of Manulife were impressed at how quickly we immobilized and responded to their request.    I thank you all for working with me on this, dropping your other priorities to make this happen which will in turn ensure we sign this deal by February 28th.   Which will bring our largest Canadian customer onboard (investment and headcount).\n\n296#\"Time to Make the Donuts\"|Thank you to the 3 of your for your help this morning, everyone was up before the crack of dawn for a 5am call with the Manulife China team, to handle a sensitive discussion around the hosting of Asian employee data.     These situations are not always easy and preparing the other team for the call isn't always as smooth as we'd like.   Appreciate your help and dedication to seeing this one through!  Enjoy a cup of coffee or another hour of sleep!\n\n297#It took a village|Yes, it certainly does! Each of you played a role in working with GLG through their buyers journey. It all began toward the end of September and culminated in signed contracts on December 13th, another sales cycle of less than 90 days, all thanks to the team here! Everyone was responsive, offered advice and guidance and helped drive this $750,000 deal to a close in a timely manner. We met and exceeded their expectations during the sales process and with their meaty per head spend (which is anticipated to increase in year two) GLG should develop into another referenceable customer! Thank you all for your contributions to this sale!\n\n298#Electrifying Avangrid's employees with positivity|Team Avangrid! We did it!  What a great journey getting Avangrid across the finish line and bringing them on as a strategic partner.  You are my village of wonderful colleagues who worked alongside me to make this happen!  Marcy, you were there for pretty much the entire journey delivering the value of our change and spend management and what does customer success look like.  Remember the first meeting we had with the WIley sisters?! We came a LONG way from that meeting to where we landed!  David, thank you for stepping in and help build a business case presentation with me and the CHRO.  He told me the executives were very impressed with what he presented!  John, taking the reigns as the executive sponsor from Tom.  I appreciate your guidance during the journey and help navigating through the contract process.  Lots of moving parts!  James and Michael, tag team RFP champions of the world.  I appreciate your thoughtful and strategic RFP response that you put together.  Their were multiple pieces with numerous questions. Quality work!  Orlagh, thank you for prompt responses to multiple security and IT questions that came our way.  They are a heavily regulated organization and you answered all their questions precisely. Teamwork does make the dream work.  We all worked together to take a tactical offering and change it into a strategic partnership!  Lucky to have you as teammates! Cheers!\n\n299#Fulfilment...Fulfillment...|Guys - thanks for your input on the 3rd party suppliers sheet - it's great to be able to pear down and reiterate some of our questions to make it a more palatable document  for all involved. Thanks again!\n\n300#Value Added at Version 1|Thanks a mill team for the enormous value you added individually and collectively yesterday as we did a great team finalist pitch with Version 1.  Very much appreciate the work you all put in to prepare and then execute so well in the meeting on the Workhuman Way of delivering ROI from R&R!   Thanks again guys and enjoy your awards!\n\n301#Always ready to Jump In!|Orlagh, I wanted to thank you for all of the work you have been doing for the Central Region.  I recognize the fact you are constantly getting asked to fill out assessments, get on calls, juggle mutiple interactions and agreements all the while investing in our security strategy as a whole.  A tall order for anyone but you always seem prepared and represent Workhuman in the most positive light.  Thank you for protecting our company and thank you for helping us win more business.  It is greeatly appreciated.\n\n302#being open about privacy|When you look for an image about 'privacy' on Google, you have to do a lot of scrolling before you find something without a padlock in it. I imagine that you've seen you fair share of those, so I picked this one instead (although I have no idea what it has to do with anything) because I wanted to give you a proper thank you, not a lazy in-passing 'ta', for half-presenting, and half-hosting a discussion, in the architecture community of practice session recently. Your initial slides set to stage nicely, and then you pivoted seamlessly into handling questions as the subject matter triggered chat among lots of techies. Thanks very much for preparing the right amount of detail, and managing the play-it-by-ear form of the meeting so well. I benefited a lot, and I think many of the others would say the same.\n\n303#Thanks a mill (in Irish) for all your UCB work!|Go raibh mile maith agat (https://youtu.be/nNwa_eYJBZY) to a fantastic team of colleagues for all the work we did together and individually on bringing our latest pharma client over the line.   From pricing, to agile, to jurisdiction, to limitation of liability, to payment terms, there were numerous hurdles to overcome but we did it and finally closed the paperwork today!   Now it's Hello Brussels for agile implementation!     Thanks again team - truly couldn't have done it without you all - go raibh maith agat aris (thanks again!) Kieran\n\n304#Its Yammer time for Schneider-Electric!|What an achievement!!!! Over 7 months of amazing teamwork that included multiple meetings, phone calls, flow charts,  more meetings, presentations, recertification, communications galore, you name it we were on it!! Well done to each one of you, as individuals your part was critical to the success of this project and as a team we bonded together and showed what working at Workhuman is all about! If I quote one of the client stakeholders, Maria Ganong - Global Rewards Director when she presented the news that we are going live on 30th September to her Executive Team they were simply thrilled that Schneider-Electric had achieved another significant milestone with Workhuman (they still talk about their successful launch back in 2016!!). She simply stated “that she has never partnered with a company like ours where people really do connect from all parts of the business. Workhuman has again raised the bar on how to work as true strategic partners with customers”! That’s some kudos and it’s all down to each one of you making Maria, Olivier, Karine, Sally and the two Tom’s appreciate the hard work that YOU have put into this important project and how thankful they are to have this new feature for all their employees to use daily when they want to promote recognition around their company. Well done to all of you!\n\n305#WAF enabled, workhuman.com & other delights|It's wonderful to work with such a dedicated group of people who go above & beyond as part of their everyday. A commitment was made to a customer and we needed to deliver for them within a specific timeline despite many challenges. You played a very important role in ensuring that we were able to achieve that deadline and although we can't see positive results in terms of activity yet it does build trust with the customer and should serve us well in terms of the bigger picture. Thank you for being so engaged and great to work with!\n\n306#The Italian-American Job!|Orlagh - thank you so much for affording me the opportunity to bring 'The Italian Job' security challenge to the Framingham office! Not only was it fantastic to bring those teachable moments to the US office it was great to be able to interact with the folks over there and put some faces to the names that I now deal with fairly regularly through our review process. Thank you!\n\n307#Orlagh & Jonathan Taking the WHWN Lead|Orlagh and Jonathan, on behalf of the WHWN, thank you for taking the lead in helping facilitate our most recent monthly WHWN meeting. Jonathan, your opening was informative, mixed with recognizing others on the network and we could all hear your excitement and passion for all of the lovely WHWN sponsored events we have had so far. Orlagh, thank you for setting the agenda, communicating to the network and ensuring we have an Exec Sponsor to help facilitate. The meeting was one with high quality and engagement, so gratitudes to the both of you for your efforts!\n\n308#Keeping us locktight.|Thank you both so much for spending the time to engage our team in a fun and memorable security walk through. Although now I want to pick more locks!\n\n309#Navigating through Rough Waters|This recognition is long overdue for some of you, but I just wanted to say thank you for all your help and assistance as we worked through the issues at Waters.  Due to some internal security issues, their program has been turned off and at different times over the past 3 months each of you has helped me in getting the program turned back on.  Whether it was providing confirmation that there was no breach on our end, managing through a number of Jira tickets, creating new scripts for reporting, or talking through contract terms, you've all lended me a hand or provided me some guidance on how best to proceed. Due to your efforts, we were able to get Waters comfortable with our processes and procedures and their program is now back up and running.  Thank you again for all your help.  Much appreciated!\n\n310#great help on the emergency requests|the customer success support team has used the redemption models in the email reminder campaigns recently.  The campaign is weekly at client level. the PII fields of employees are very critical to the model score calculation. Therefore, we need to get the help from request support team and approval on these PII fields. it is urgent issue for me.  Enda and Orlagh have given very good support on the emergency issue, including to get very quick approval from orlagh and help from Enda, who has pulled the PII fields as soon as he gets the approval message from Orlagh as as to get the result of redemption model score on time.  This award is the appreciation   for Enda and Orlagh's helps! Thanks!\n\n311#TIAA Finalist Pitch|Marcy, two weeks in a row - 2 completely different pitches (1 onsite for 20 minutes and 1 remote for 3 hours), but you helped us strategize on tailoring an approach for both and you carried a heavy portion of this meeting ranging from Customer Success, to reporting, to implementation. You are a Baaaaaad- a double money sign! Tom, thanks for the support as always - I know you wanted an onsite to get out of the office, we're still working on it - don't worry I'm doing it more for Alissa than you. Orlagh, thanks for staying the whole session and handling the few questions they had. Hillary, we had you on jic, but I appreciate you're willingness to step in. Nuvs, thanks for the Product and IT support :-) you helped me get the mobile demo working - appreciate the out of the box thinking. Amanda, thanks for making sure we had a custom demo ready for us to review prior to I appreciate you ushering that through.

THANK YOU!\n\n312#Linked In back on track|I wanted to thank you all for the quick and decisive action that each of you have taken to resolve the issue which was holding up payment. Thanks to you copying the right contacts to my initial query the issue which was ongoing for a few weeks was very quickly closed. Thanks to Corbrina deciding to contact the customer they agreed to drop their equirement and proceed with the P.O. and payment immediately. Thank you Julia, Orlagh and Corbrina! Enjoy!\n\n313#Singapore Sling|'Singapore Sling'...a rather tasty cocktail, but also an apt description of the way our friends in Singapore kept throwing request after request at us! The amount of patience, determination and creativity that was shown by the Workhuman Legal, Finance, Infosec and Proposal writing teams was impressive. Thank you all for hanging in there and seeing this one through to the end. As we were repeatedly told, this is the start of a partnership which will lead onto a company-wide programme. I'll be sure to keep pushing for that, but it's safe to say that we would be nowhere at all without the innovation of this team - a special thank you to Julia for spearheading these efforts and for your willingness to engage with Unilever at every twist and turn!\n\n314#Teen Turns Facilitators and teachers|A huge thank you to all of you for your help in making this years 'Teen Turns' programme such a success for both Bronagh and Danika. Your generosity with your time and knowledge was greatly appreciated by both of the girls, and your willingness to take the sessions, at sometimes quite short notice, was so helpful to me in organising the girl's schedule. The team effort required to coordinate a program like this is huge, and would not be possible without your generosity and hard work. - Thank you all!\n\n315#Data Deal Saver|Orlagh, on behalf of myself and John, thank you so much for leading the data discussion in our onsite with Freddie Mac. As a US government sponsored enterprise, they have strict policies for where their data is held. When they voiced concerns with our DRP in Dublin, we knew you were the best resource to connect them with to convey our commitment to data security and protocols. A week ago, Freddie said sending their data offshore was a non-starter. Now after speaking with you they are open to sending us their security questionnaire and meeting with one of our government sponsored enterprise customers to discuss how to make this partnership possible. This couldn't have been possible without your expertise, professionalism and willingness to jump in!\n\n316#Happy Finance Customers|Thank you all for your part in analysing, developing, configuring and deploying Fast Close for the finance team.  This tool will make the business of reporting and analysing our financials a much easier and quicker process and will greatly help us in our efforts in shortening the window for us to report our financials.  From everyone in the finance team that will benefit from this,  thank you!\n\n317#HEAP is live for 250+ clients!|Hi Team! I would like to recognise the efforts you have put into making HEAP happen. From analysis to implementation, reviewing the applications you do not own, coordination with other teams about potentially PII containing data, implementing the fixes, reviewing, testing, auditing, fixing again (just notice how many different \"ings\").  Enabling HEAP will give us a lot of insights into user behaviour and ability to change it. It will also show us how users react to the changes we have implemented. The ability to \"close the loop\" is the critical part in analysing the data that we did not have before. You made it happen!\n\n318#Technical can-do in balance with security|Thank you to each of you for solving a multitude of small issues for me - everything from getting WSL up and running, public key niggles, chats about Linux on the desktop - you've all been amazing to work with. Prompt, concise and solution-focused. Thank you!\n\n319#Quality and security|Martin and Orlagh, Thank you both for your support making sure the two U.S. culture survey emails would arrive in employee inboxes  by whitelisting the sender addresses. I appreciate your commitment to our secure environment and for helping test to ensure we were ready on launch day. Much appreciated!\n\n320#Great Teamwork|Guys, I just wanted to say thank you for ensuring that we were able to get access to a new software application.. I appreciate with everyone been uber busy that in a fairly short time all the right questions asked of the right people and you all were able to ensure we got what we needed right on time.. Thanks again and enjoy the award..\n\n321#You're a Great Help Always!|Orlagh, this is long due award but we definitely didn't ignore the help from your side so just would like to Thank you and appreciate your recent participation in our numerous demos one of them was KPMG where you have to explain all the IT and security questions number of times as they had made some changes on their side and as usual you have taken care at such an ease and made them comfortable that they're in safe hands and some last minute request for Glenmark and so on. I am sure Sanjib will echo on all this with me.\n\n322#A-Team for Accenture|As we have wrapped the big presentation this morning to the broad global team  and I just wanted to take a moment to recognize everyone not only for the amazing presentation today but for the copious amount of time that each of you spent to make sure that your part of the presentation excelled.  During the presentation I was receiving texts from the prospects that we were once again \"covering topics that far above exceeded everyone else in the space\"!  We have some work to do still but this meeting and the research that went into it has put us in a great place to proceed to the next level with Accenture.  We say team is the dream here but the best really excelled today!  So much appreciated!\n\n323#Contract renewal & security responses|Thank you for the time & effort taken to respond to 2 questionnaires as part of the LI renewal.  Your attention to detail and urgency in getting these time-consuming documents completed is truly appreciated.  In this particular instance we were all set with one set  after many hours work when another similar document was sent our way with an aggressive timeline and once again you both deliver.  I really admire how all of these requests get managed and completed when I only have sight of a small number and know that given the group calling on you that this number can be multiplied many times! You are great colleagues and really valued, fantastic working with you!\n\n324#AWS Infrastructure Review|Thank you all for attending the AWS infrastructure review with BSI yesterday. This review provides an excellent opportunity for us to discuss the existing infrastructure, best practices, and future plans. The willing to provide documentation in advanced and taking the time out of your day to speak to the BSI consultant is much appreciated. Thank you!!!!\n\n325#Exelon Questionnaire|Wow Orlagh! I can't thank you enough for how quickly you completed the Q/A from Exelon. We are in an RFP process right now where they gave us a tight timeline to complete a review of their MSA. Your work (in less than a day I might add) will go a long way to ensure we stay inline with their target date. Thank you for the effort!\n\n326#Thank you!!!|Thank you for your assistance in preparing a test client in the production environment for BSI to assess. Your willingness to meet, discuss the options and implement the required changes at short notice was appreciated.  Thank you!!!\n\n327#Tech Teen Turn|Thanks for your assistance in running our Tech Teen Turn session for some budding potential new recruits. The feedback was superb from the session and the students found it hugely informative for them as to look to chart their future careers. Thanks for participating!\n\n328#WATCH OUT-  SECURITY TRAINING WORKS!! . . really|Your training works!  Looking at email addresses has not really been a priority for me, but your training has highlighted this . . . .and it has worked. Infiltrating emails requested for payroll changes! Mega good work!\n\n329#Champions IT Sec Team!!|This award is way overdue!! Just wanted to say a big thank you to the both of you for all the times you've helped me with various issues, requests, tickets!! You guys always are keen to help no matter how busy you are, and always do an amazing job!!\n\n330#BSI Event Security Presentation|Thanks for your swift work to turnaround the Security presentation updates for me. With Workhuman Live upon us and without much time to the event date you pulled out the stops and got me a finished product in doublequick time. Many Thanks\n\n331#Jackpot!  IGT- the newest customer!|The reason why I picked this picture and chose this title is IGT manufactures lottery ticket machines and slot machines. Anyway, what a journey!  2 and a half years and their first RFP I declined because it was not strategic!  Over the 2 plus years, me and my village of awesome colleagues built a business case to help better understand our strategy and impacts we have organizations.  We had multiple starts and stops and HR and project leadership changes to navigate through! To the team that was along on this journey.  Erik, thank you for all your help setting up initial meetings when you were my inside sales champion.  Marcy, my wonder twin (the cool one!) making such an impact on the partnering for success and doing the analytics on the demo at multiple on-site meetings.  Tom V and John, your leadership, guidance and support to get this across the finish line.  To this day, the on-site meeting Tom V, Marcy and I had with 17 IGT people was the most engaging and collaborative meetings I have been a part of in my territory!! John, this is our first deal that we have worked on together.  You did an admirable job going through the contract process and helping identifying next steps.  To Michael and Orlagh, for your expertise on the IT/Security and info sec. reviews with a short window of turnaround time.  Jennie for help with the customer onboarding process.  And, Julia for starting the legal process and getting the contracts ready.  What a team!  Teamwork makes the dream work!  I will be toasting all of you tonight! Cheers!\n\n332#2 Contracts in 1 day = true March madness!|Thank you to this committed & determined cross-functional team for your support, partnership and hard work to evaluate, negotiate, and finalize not one but TWO contracts and get both Heap and SPS Commerce signed in the final hours of the quarter!  Between all of the security questions and investigations that we have been working through for months with Heap, to the length of the evaluations and contract negotiations, to then pulling everything together this week to wrap up, cover a lot of questions in the last few days, and successfully negotiate highly advantageous deals with both technology vendors, you all contributed to this long, complex process.  I saw through this experience how our cross-functional team can come together, each bring expertise across different areas, and work creatively to establish solutions and drive outcomes.    Both of these partnerships represent major milestones for e-commerce and the broader Workhuman organization, and I am so excited to start driving results with both technologies in place.  Great job, team, and thank you!\n\n333#Almo Call|Thank you for jumping on the Almo security assessment call! If you were jet lagged it sure didn’t show.  You were on point and efficiently ran through the assessment. It is always a challenge to get different folks from all over together for a call so truly appreciate your sense of urgency to get this done and keep things moving for us!\n\n334#Making the job a little easier...|Just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you for your help getting my little Bulk Shipping Email Automation Project off the ground. Whether it was the script, trying to work out some of the  security issues, sneaky little powershell lessons or testing, testing, testing, you all played a role in getting this process in place which resulted in saving a massive amount of manual work for the FF team. I am so grateful for your innovation and teamwork, which resulted in us being able to send our first batch of emails to over 40 clients successfully this week. There are still a few minor issues to resolve but I'm sure with a little time, we can figure them out ;) Enjoy your well deserved rewards all!\n\n335#Herculean effort!|A huge thanks to you Orlagh for the enormous amount of work you've put into all the CISO work with Aviva. I know that this is the prospect that just keeps asking and despite already providing a very thorough and comprehensive response to the eye-watering number of questions, they then hit you with another bible's worth of questions! Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and cracking on. I've spoken at length with the Aviva team and they are hugely appreciative of the work you're continuing to do for them. I really believe that you are helping to put us in a seriously strong position with this account. Thanks a mill!\n\n336#Balance for better...|Thank you for all so much for sharing your views and experiences around #balanceforbetter, for International Women's Day! We had such a short time to meet and pull this together and you all did a fantastic job, what an incredible turn out?!!  We've received such good feedback already, I think this is the start of something great so thank you all for kicking off these conversations!\n\n337#Quality work in a short period of time for IGT!!|Orlagh and Michael,  Over the past week I have sent you some IT/security deliverables for IGT and there were short turnaround times for both requests.  Not only did you meet the required deadlines, the quality of work and detail was impressive.  We are in the middle of contracts and bringing them on as one of our newest customers.  Your work is very important to the contract process.  I know that both of you were working on this over the weekend on the most recent deliverable so, thank you for going above and beyond and delivering quality! Cheers!\n\n338#On Target at Roche!|A HUGE thank you team for being so well prepared and therefore so on target for our finalist pitch meeting at Roche on Wednesday.  We individually and collectively as a team were very well drilled, on message and on time with what we needed to deliver and I think we certainly met all our targets in that regard.  Still a long way to go on this one and no doubt commercial discussions will be intense as we move forward, but I’m very pleased and thankful to you all for what we accomplished on Wednesday.   Onwards and upwards!\n\n339#Thank You!|Orlagh; thanks so much for your timely response and going above & beyond to handle the security assessment from Dover Fueling Solutions. Working with a client's third party vendor is never straightforward, and I appreciated your willingness to complete the entire assessment on a fast schedule while still remaining available for the vendor's follow-up questions. Thanks for being a great teammate and sharing your valuable experience with this client's launch!\n\n340#Changing the world one meeting at a time|Team, I wanted to pause and celebrate how far we have come in our mission to bring humanity back into the workplace and beyond.  Yes, we do get stuck in the weeds from time to time, however each of these critical questions and discussions has brought us that much closer to a solution that will work in and out of the corporate environment.  We all bring a unique perspective to the table and we all respect each others thoughts and ideas in order to build upon them.  Great work thus far and I look forward to what we will bring to the world as the days, months and years unfold.\n\n341#Delivering EVERY time!|Michael, Mark, Orlagh - Thank you so much for all your efforts over the past couple of months. This award is long overdue...I meant to formally thank each of you for your help with BT & Unilever, then with Diageo, then with Virgin, AstraZeneca, Aviva...there seemed to be a never ending stream of requests for your help, generally at very short notice. You've worked through weekends and on flights (Michael/Mark - thanks again for getting that document back to me after your return flight to Boston!). Your involvement is critical to helping us win business. Thank you for always being so willing to invest so much of your time and energy, it's massively appreciated! Here's to working with each of you on many more opportunities throughout 2019!\n\n342#Patience for Panasonic|Michael and Orlagh - I can't thank you enough for your patience and determination in responding to Panasonic on their data security review. It seems like every time we respond, they have 3 more new questions waiting in the wings. While it might not have been the most organized process, I really appreciate you getting back to me so quickly so we can keep them on track. You have both earned your drink tickets!\n\n343#Works Council Support|Orlagh - Avantor came to us in a bit of a panic that their Works Council had given them a security questionnaire due the very next business day that they'd never seen to us. With everything that is going on and all the client commits already been on the table, you stepped up and completed the 8 tab questionnaire in just two short days (after we had initially told them it could take up to two weeks!). With a follow up meeting with their German works council team on Friday and a prep call scheduled for tomorrow, having the questionnaire completed and the documentation delivered means the world to me - and the client! Thank you!\n\n344#Avantor - urgency wins the day|Orlagh, just wanted to single you out as the one person who epitomizes the respect for urgency.  When it went down to the wire to close the contracts with Avantor, you stepped up every time in such a speedy manner so we could always stay on schedule.  There were a lot of technical security moving parts and you stayed on top of them all!  Thank you for all of this as we closed the business the evening of the last day of the quarter!  Roger\n\n345#Security awareness training via Globouniversity!!!|Thank you all for your help with the latest round of security awareness training through Globouniversity. The preparation consisted of selecting the training modules, testing the modules using different browsers, creating email templates and lastly ensuring all staff members were registered within Globouniversity.  Thank you all for your help. Excellent teamwork!!!!!\n\n346#Thanks|Thank you for spending time with Laoise last week, as part of her transition year work experience. You kindly took time out of your day to explain what it is like to work at Globoforce.  Laoise had a great week here and really enjoyed the experience!\n\n347#Keeping us compliant|Thanks Orlagh for working with the various internal and external teams to get our PCI self assessment certificate over the line, allowing us to report same to Worldpay and continue to be 'compliant' in their eyes for another year.  Once again you showed all the qualities that were recognised at the recent 'Women in Tech Awards' and herded the various resources towards completing this, thank  you!\n\n348#Security Audit Overload!|Thank you team for all of your hard work and extra hours that you put into the many security/data protection audits that came your way from multiple customers, seemingly all at once. Most of these audits were due in a short time frame, required input from all of you, and in some cases a conference call with a team of security analysts was required.  I'm thankful for all of the measures we have in place to protect our customers' data and confident that this team will deliver a solid report each and every time.  Cheers to a job well done!\n\n349#security requirements|Orlagh, thank you for giving the Project404 team an overview of the security requirements for self service at our team meeting last week.  This was very helpful to the team and gave everyone a better insight into the security requirements.\n\n350#Time's up...lets move on to .NET|Team, I know it has been a long road and many many calls to get us to the final day before we make to switch over to .NET.  All of you played a critical role in helping Customer Success and our Clients transition as quickly and as smoothly as possible with minimal downstream impact.  Whether it was reporting to validate who was where, or hopping on calls with Clients to walking them through the change management process or audit questions you were always there lending a helping hand or offering yet another solution.  We cannot thank you enough for the efforts you have put forth to ensure a seamless transition.  Cheers to you and here is to pulling the plug on Saturday.  Well done!\n\n351#The Sherlock Security Challenge in Framingham|Thank you for taking the time to ensure our colleagues in the Framingham office experienced The Sherlock Security Challenge.  Based on the photos on Slack and the feedback received you did a great job. Well Done!!!\n\n352#VIP of TLAs|You've made such a huge impact on the organisation since you joined with the numerous security related technology initiatives that you've spearheaded. From PCI to CIS, ISO to AES, TLS to GDPR (I know this is an FLA but who's counting?), you juggle it all with ease and put our best security stance forward time and again. A pleasure to work with for all your colleagues, you are the consummate security professional through and through. Its my pleasure to have you on the team. Thanks for everything!\n\n353#Day or night|There have been quite a few requests and demands on your time of late from Humana and J&J  and often these requests come at a time that works for our prospects but not necessarily for us.   Unfortunately when those requests come in for an afternoon call (which has happened several times as of late) that means a late evening for you.  I really appreciate your flexibility and dedication to joining these calls and walking our prospects through some very complex issues.  It goes a long way towards helping us win new customers and it is very much appreciated!\n\n354#The Sherlock Security Challenge Team!!!!|Thank you all for your help with The Sherlock Security Challenge. The preparation commenced some weeks ago with booking the room, ordering costumes, lollipops, badges, creating the graphics through to providing the required IT equipment, communicating the event to our colleagues taking photographs and overseeing the event on the day.  This event allowed us to highlight the importance of security awareness in a fun way. This event couldn't have happened without your help, thank you!!!!\n\n355#AWS, here we come...|Team, I wanted to thank each of you for your expertise in helping move Phase 1 of AWS forward.  Without your support and guidance we would not have been able to quickly craft a letter to our Clients outlining the actions we are about to embark upon over the course of the next 24 months as well as highlight what near term steps our Customers will need to take to ensure a seamless transition.  Although the journey has just begun I am confident with the focus and expertise each of you brings to our discussion that we will collectively overcome any challenge. Thank you again for all the help thus far as well as you patience through a few choppy 9AM calls.\n\n356#TeenTurn|Thank you to everyone who participated in the TeenTurn Project. It is great to see how many people were involved and volunteered spending time with Casey and Iqra, showing them different areas of our business and making these 2 weeks very special. It was absolute pleasure for me organising day to day schedule for the girls knowing that each of you was so open for help and very creative during your workshops! Very energetic and rewarding 2 weeks. Thank you!\n\n357#Always there when needed!|I cannot thank you enough for your unwavering support and willingness to jump on a phone (often after hours Irish time) call whenever you are asked.  This past week we had two very important calls with key prospects (Humana - late stage and ExxonMobil - early stage).  I am always so impressed by your easy and calm manner as well as the depth and breadth of your technical knowledge.  All of this is tremendously reassuring to our prospective customers that Globoforce is indeed the right partner for them.   You have been an outstanding addition to Globoforce and a real joy to work with!  Thanks so much for all of the tremendous support, it makes a BIG difference.\n\n358#Long Journey with a successful ending|Team, What a journey we had bringing Akamai Technologies across the finish line and now one of our newest customers.  It takes a village.  Erik, we started this journey back in September of 2016.  Your quick follow up to one of their managers that previously worked at Cisco was spot on and started us on the right path.  Tom Vitkofsky, I appreciate your strategy sessions over the two year period.  Orlagh, jumping on multiple security calls as we had to play rewind and press play again in this journey.  Dan, thank you for helping me customize the demo a bit so I could do recorded demo's for their evaluation.  Julia,  the best I have seen you work through a contract to date. You are hitting your stride!  Tom Higgins, thank you for stepping in to help when Tom V. needed some coverage.  You lead a very smooth contract process while developing a great connection with their business lead to help them understand our contracts.  Last but not least, Marcy!  You have been there with me through the majority of this journey.  You were on-site with me at least four times including taking the lead on a 4-hour strategy session. They complimented me for bringing the right person to that meeting.  That compliment obviously goes to you.  Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to this journey. Cheers!\n\n359#Security Question Hustle|Shawn, Michael, and Orlagh - Thank you so much for handling multiple last minute security request from our client who is presenting to their application readiness team today. By providing these answers quickly, we ensure they stay on schedule with their early July launch! Great work everyone!\n\n360#GDPR and our people|Many thanks for your introduction to the GDPR information session arranged for our people managers, outlining their responsibilities for the data they retain on employees. For such a sombre subject you injected great humour to the proceedings!\n\n361#Pop Quiz, Pizza & Beers|Hi All, i'm sure there were lots more people involved in the GDPR /Pop Quiz yesterday - but I just wanted to thank you all personally for presenting the updates, I found the session to be super fun, very well thought out & informative! I really enjoy it so thank you :)!\n\n362#GDPR - Information Security & Product Tag Team|Thank You for taking the time out of your busy schedule to do a last minute meeting for Schneider-Electric and their questions around GDPR and GDPR T&C splash page.

Appreciate you celebrating the release over the weekend and for coordinating the simultaneous gong ringing with Orlagh and Rachel. Great team effort by all and thanks for celebrating!\n\n365#GDPR Cross Functional Puzzle Masters|Each one of you managed a significant piece of the GDPR puzzle to get your teams ready for May 25--no small feat. We are now ready to forget people upon request, properly secure and encrypt personal data wherever it appears, and be fully transparent with our users about how, when and why we make use of their data. Along the way, we’ve developed new approaches to generating invoices, incorporated new technology to keep our data secure, cleaned up old processes we’ve been meaning to tackle for years, and better defined the rules of the road for going forward. It’s through your extraordinary efforts that we are able to say with confidence that we are prepared for GDPR. Thank you for your ongoing participation in our weekly check-ins and side meetings, your proactive look at how we can best address the requirements, and the active follow up throughout these past several months. Kudos to all of you for ensuring Globoforce reached this milestone!!\n\n366#To the Rescue|Thank you so much for coming to my rescue. The taxi was late, I could have been stuck.  You went out of your way to get me where I needed to go!! Very kind!!  Much appreciated. Casey\n\n367#Team Healthineers!|A huge thank you to each of you for your involvement with our finalist meeting in Erlangen, Germany. We were working to very short notice on this one, literally only finding out a few days before the meeting, that we had been shortlisted and then each of you providing fantastic content and feedback, to make for a high level presentation. I really appreciate the efforts everyone took to reach Erlangen, it was a big ask and without the autobahn approach to speed limits, Marcy would never have caught her return flight! The feedback from the most senior stakeholder in the room to KC at the end, was that the presentation \"was inspiring!\"...high praise indeed and well deserved! Thanks again and fingers firmly crossed that they now make the right decision.\n\n368#Can you please respond by 2 weeks ago?|Thank you for your amazingly quick turn-around time with some VERY last min client requests pertaining to documentation and questions around GDPR.  I know you got quite a few \"urgent\" emails recently and despite a million things on your plates (and traveling for a work conference!) you responded to all their questions and provided the requested information. Fingers crossed we don't get many more before May 25th!  Thank you again!!!\n\n369#Bringing Quality to Akamai|Marcy, Orlagh and Tom, Thank you for being totaly prepared for the IT/Security and Project Management meeting with Akamai.  We were able to cover all the agenda items thoroughly and on time.  David commented to me in an email how \"put together and prepared the Globforce team is\"  Next steps should be to finish up the contracts and bring this partnership on board. I am energized by the level of quality you bring to the prospects in my territory time after time. Cheers!\n\n370#Its all about GDPR|Orla,  Our American suppliers are arriving in on the 11th hour looking for help on GDPR. Thankfully you kindly helped on the calls to help alleviate any concerns and avoided disruption to services. Much appreciated, thanks and enjoy!\n\n371#Welcoming & Engaging Travelport|We always invite our customers and prospects to visit our offices and are delighted when they do, James well done on making the case on why Jane & Michelle from Travelport should visit our Dublin office and meet the team.  Thank you to each of you for the important role that you played in the Travelport meeting yesterday and making our guests feel so welcome.  The meeting provided the opportunity to introduce them to some of our wonderful people, start to build great relationships, discuss so many key topics and inform their thinking & approach.  They were really impressed with our building and facilities and took various photos to inspire their own office space redesign.  James, Jane & Michelle flew back to Southampton together last night and Jane \"shared that they \"really enjoyed our visit to Dublin and found the meeting extremely worthwhile and helpful\". Thanks again & great work everyone!\n\n372#Compliance and security work at it's finest|Orlagh, thank you so much for your help with a number of security/compliance related requests that I've sent your way over the past few weeks.  One in particular for Citi required some quick turnaround to satisfy a large request, all of this coming right when you were not even settled from your holiday!  Thank you for always being so available and thorough in responding to these highly sensitive and critical requests.  You are a true asset to our customers and all of Globoforce.  Thank you!\n\n373#You got Security Questions we have the answers!|Orlagh, thanks for you quick response and great work with getting us going with Allscripts request for a call to discuss security.  You responded so quickly with the docs they where looking for and jumped on a call with them the next day to start working through the questions.... plus it was 6:30 pm your time but you made yourself available to accommodate their schedule.  The call went great as you had provided so much of the information in advance and she made the comment \"you really seem to know what you are doing on a global basis\". Great way to start a relationship and hopefully a partnership also.  Thanks for the great and quick support.\n\n374#GDPR guidance|Thanks very much Orlagh for your help and guidance with some GDPR requests and questions I had this morning. The insight into how it is impacting our Production system was very interesting too. Thanks again.\n\n375#Thanks again|Orla,  Thanks again for the time to review the back up data. Enjoy!\n\n376#Energizing BP!|Thank you to each of you for being part of our BP on- site meeting.  They appreciated your welcome and the knowledge that you shared. They really benefited from the interaction and got so much from being able to speak directly to you and ask their questions.  Your involvement made this a successful meeting so thank you and well done!\n\n377#Orlagh speaks spanish, sort of!|I've never had a call where our main contact in Chile spoke english on the WebEx, but everyone else from her team spoke spanish.  Orlagh had to answer IT questions is english, our main contact had to translate what was said to her team in spanish and then we would get more IT questions and start all over again.  Orlagh, you were so patient and never lost control of the conversation.  Glad you were on the call with me this am.  Bet you hope they don't have any more IT questions. :)\n\n378#Orlagh = Sage Advice|Orlagh,  I just wanted to take a min to recognize you for all that you do for our clients.  Over the past few months I've encountered quite a few situations (including employee fraud, credit card issue, etc.) where I haven't been sure how to respond or who to even ask.  You always provide sage advice and  I appreciate how specific you are in terms of client facing positioning.  Thank you!\n\n379#Weekend security alert!|Thank you so much for reaching out to me over the weekend to let me know about a potential security issue with my personal email account. Gertie, you quickly recognized that the email you received from my personal account was not legitimate, and immediately contacted Orlagh and me. Orlagh, thank you for advising on how to handle the issue with my email provider.\n\n380#Tenacity|We had a Security Rick Assessment come in with 235 questions and over 30 documents required.  You provided determination, persistence and perseverance to complete a quality SRA on time and on target.   We are fortunate to have you on Team GF. Thank you for your tenacity!  Merrie\n\n381#On-boarding New Support Partner|Thank you all for your input, support, guidance and urgency (when needed) over these past few months as we on-boarded Auxilion as our new Dynamics CRM Support Partner. From SOWs to Ts&Cs and 3rd Party Assessments we ticked all the boxes required of on-boarding process. You responded to short notice calls and requests at the blink of an eye particularly during our busy Q4 period. Your support in reaching a successful outcome is much appreciated.\n\n382#Thank you for taking the time|Thank you for carving time out of your busy schedules to meet with us last week. You shared info about your teams, your priorities and how we could partner together. It is so helpful to learn about what you and your teams since we don't get an opportunity to interact on a regular basis. Hopefully, these learnings will open up the doors for collaboration on many projects.\n\n383#Ignite Prep|Thanks for all your help with the materials for presentation at Ignite. I couldn't have pulled it all together in the quick turnaround time needed without your support. Many Thanks for your assistance!\n\n384#FINRA's Finest #FTFW|Shout out to the FINRA team.  Everyone on the team contributed with high impact to bring this high profile, conservative financial institution on board for a competitive win.  To Tom V. throughout the sales cycle on direction and leadership for the discussions and meetings; Rob S. for maneuvering through gross up discussions and successfully right-sizing the conversation, Dan for ongoing Workday ideas on positioning, Bill Y and Marcy for quality preparation and thorough attention to detail in our presentations.  Special shout out to Hillary for herculean efforts to enable the redlining and plowing through Docusign special features, to Lauren and Orlagh for your support through the many iterations of IT, security and privacy concerns, and to Erik S. my lame duck partner to make this a true partnership win, shepherding the many WorkHuman attendees and Evanta contacts to ensure a great beginning and a fine finish with the FINRA team.     Thank you all, Roger  #FTFW --  for the finra win...\n\n385#BP Energize! Army|It takes a small army to land and launch a client. So, fall in and take your praise. I want you all to know that the BP team said that this was one of their favorite projects in all their time with BP. They have been live for 3 days and communicated just today that this was a model launch. This is all thanks to your contributions, big and small. From contract to launch, we did it in a bit over 4 months. Incredible team work everyone. It is always a bit bumpy during a launch, not matter how well we plan something always pops up and we always figure it out. Something I learned about the GF team, we always figure it out, even if it is ½ a second before the launch. Thank you for everything you did to make this launch a success. You each had an important role and it shows in the immediate success of this launch. Well done team!! I appreciate you!\n\n386#Thanks for taking the time|Orlagh, thanks so much for taking the time to sit with me this morning, really appreciated you making yourself available. Cheers.\n\n387#InfoSec Inspiration|Time after time I've received wonderful feedback about your openness, responsiveness, expertise and willingness to help. Whether with Customers or internal stakeholders I have had nothing but positive reports whenever Orlagh's name is mentioned. Thanks for all your hard work and assistance over the course of 2017 and keep on spreading the positivity laden message of Security & Compliance in the New Year!\n\n388#Always there when needed|Orlagh I can't thank you enough for all the outstanding (and tireless) support you've given to me this past year.  If you only look at Aetna and the work you've done with them, that alone would be reason enough for this recognition.  Every time I need support on complex (well at least complex to me) issues related to our data or our environment, you are always cheerfully ready to get on the phone with our prospects and customers and give them the information and reassurance they need.  It's such a pleasure to have you as a resource and have the confidence that no matter what, Orlagh will handle it. Best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a wonderful 2018!\n\n389#The Race to Christmas|Thank you for your 8 months worth of work to move AbbVie onto their very own contract.  They had spun out from Abbott 5 years ago and really wanted to finally break away from that connection and onto their own document.  It was a virtual showdown of legal teams, both sides liking their own document templates and not budging.  While we did blink to move the process along, we definitely won the outcome and I would say multiplied the good will tenfold.  We have a very happy customer, a auto renew contract, and did not make any pricing concessions.  Thank you for your strong support, long days, empty ink wells, and tolerance for my persistence.  We have run an ultra marathon, but we beat the head winds and made it ahead of the deadline!  Sincere thanks for your expertise and patience!\n\n390#GE UAT environment set-up|All, thank you for giving this a priority and completing the environment set-up on time to give to GE. We had many complications and tight deadline. You have done all possible and impossible to make it happen. Appreciate the effort and the result!\n\n391#AD account approval|Orlagh thanks for the quick help on the two individual account requests last week. It was last minute on both and you had us sorted even while away from your desk. Thanks and appreciated..\n\n392#Work placement student|Thanks Orlagh, for spending time with our work placement student to describe your role and area of responsibility to him\n\n393#Test environment access|Thanks for addressing the access limitations to useful test data which was impacting the progress of migrating older clients to the Finance app.\n\n394#Help is always there|Orlagh, this is long overdue but I would like to thank you for the support you gave while working through an issue with the client. I have to say you were very thorough walking me through the best approach. You were able to provide me with a document template so I didn't have to create one and also reviewed this file, and a proposed letter that we can send going forward. You really let me know that we are in good hands when it comes to security questions! Thanks again!\n\n395#Teen Turns security experience|Orlagh, many thanks for your assistant with the Teen Turn initiative this year. We had to accommodate some last minute changes and your flexibility was great. Hopefully the wombat training will have given them some security insights they can transfer to their daily lives.\n\n396#Last Minute Nestle Turnaround!|Orlagh, thanks a mill for turning around the Nestle Security Questionnaire yesterday - we inadvertently gave you so little time and yet you still managed to complete the task within a very tight deadline.  Thanks so much for that, and indeed for all you do to help us keep winning in the marketplace - hugely appreciated by me and everyone on the International sales team  Cheers, and Enjoy, Kieran\n\n397#Another great Canadian Win!|Thanks to all of your for your contribution in our newest Canadian Win - OMERS!   Thanks to all of you who made a difference and helped us beat out OCT & Achievers on this one!   It's was several years in the making and a grueling process these last 3 months to get this one in the books!  You were all amazing and contributed in your own way, without EACH and EVERYONE of you we wouldn't have won!  #WETHENORTH    Already looking forward to our next win!\n\n398#Team ITT Security|Michael and Orlagh,  Thank you for your expertise and quick turnaround on the security review for ITT.  Orlagh, I know you were on the road at BP and Michael, you have been absolutely swamped with RFP's.  However, both of you worked together to still meet their deadline.  I truly appreciate your hardwork and dedication and working on this most likely during after work hours.  This will be a very important piece in their evaluation on VOC. Cheers!\n\n399#Team BP!|A massive thank you to Team BP - each and every one of you was a true Super Star! From the moment I asked for your help, to the final handshake onsite, there was nothing but complete focus, energy, enthusiasm and dedication to delivering a stellar performance. I greatly appreciate all of the prep-work everyone got involved in, Noel's willingness to join remotely while traveling on holiday with family (!), Rob getting up in the middle of the night while on holiday to add his credibility to a strong line-up of our very best SMEs, and Team America for traveling thousands of miles! and of course Orlagh for your impressive expertise and KC for your sound advice and counsel. Thanks everyone, it was truly an impressive performance and one that I feel has really set us up for some positive discussions and momentum in the coming days and weeks. Thank you!\n\n400#Great teamwork to a colleague|Thank you all for your patience and help today when the two meeting rooms I booked had declined my booking and I didn't realise till the night before an external training.  All of you moved locations without even a squeak and made the whole process a lot better than it could have been.  Due to your teamwork, the training was delivered as originally scheduled and the teams attending didn't have to miss out.   Many thanks\n\n401#Coordinated IT outflank|Orlagh takes a moment from her holiday.  Dan rises up from the Gratitude Bar iPads.   Rob redials into full street cred support.  The result?  A decisive positive conversation to nearly sail through the IT and SEC vetting process with our Maryland prospect.  Thank you for lending your time talent and compassion immediately after WorkHuman.  Well done all!  Roger\n\n402#Team S-M-E to the Rescue!|Orlagh, Bill, Steve, Dan, and Kurt,  Thank you for your expert assistance with the Rogers Communications RFP. This one was a bit tricky due to some of the customer's unique ideas regarding what the program will look like, as well as the detailed compliance questions they included in the questionnaire. I very much appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to lend me a hand and make sure our proposal response met each and every one of their requirements to the best of our ability. Hopefully the respect and attention we show Rogers will go a long way toward winning this opportunity and beating a certain Canadian competitor on their home turf.  Thanks again! James\n\n403#Trans-Atlantic High Five|Orlagh: I wanted to thank you for such amazing teamwork and support on the litany of information security/data protection reviews that we've had as of recent. With the legal landscape changing ever so quickly in the EU, your ability to compartmentalize where we stand today with an eye toward where we're headed tomorrow is second to none. You really have your finger on the pulse of what we can support and where we need to push back and it's incredibly reassuring to know we have you as a second set of eyes in the cross-sections of technology & law, where most scenarios are enveloped with grey area. You are truly a fantastic teammate.\n\n404#Abbott Vendor survey|Orlagh- Thank you for all of your time, hard work and dedication to get the Abbott survey completed. I know that it took way too long to complete, and appreciate your time and effort during the process!\n\n405#Charity Brilliance|Thanks a million for all the help. Your all stars from the bakers to the lifters, carriers and door openers. This would not have been possible without you. We raised EUR255.00 for Temple St for Equipment for the ICU Dept. Thanks from the bottom of my heart.\n\n406#Swooping in to save the day...|Orlagh and Lauren – I can’t thank you enough for your outstanding work and effort with Aetna on Friday.  There we were with final contracts ready to be signed when they realized internally there was a mistake!  There were a series of IT/Technical documents we needed to fill out before we could move forward - their business team dropped the ball which created a tremendous amount of work for us.  As I was in transit to our club trip in Jamaica, you both jumped all over the work that needed to be done – not only did you fill out the questionnaires, but you also got on the phone with their compliance/risk team to brief them on out policies and procedures.  Because of your commitment to the account, their internal team gave us the green light to move forward.  Thank you so much for your commitment to the sale and the sales team overall; we wouldn’t be successful without you.\n\n407#Fantastic Responsiveness|Orlagh, this award is a bit overdue! I just wanted to say A VERY BIG THANK YOU! for being so quick and so comprehensive in all your responses in the multiple prospect requests that myself and James have sent your way in the past while.

We just concluded yet another call and their IT team kept saying \"we are really pleased with how you Globoforce answered all of these questions.  Everything you have stated is absolutely in line with our requirements.\"  This is not a small feat given how challenging very large organizations like Walmart can be.

Well done!\n\n413#Lord Vendor Request|Team, thank you so much for your help with Lords Vendor Privacy Questionnaire! You made the process so easy and you delivered it a full week ahead of what we expected. Every client/CSM loves that, but it was esp helpful for this client!\n\n414#Last minute Citi hurdles|At 4:00 Eastern on a  Friday afternoon the Globoforce team was anxiously awaiting the final signed agreement that the client promised before the end of day.  We had already come to complete agreement and were told everything was good to go.  At the last minute the client makes us aware that a detailed analysis and review of our cloud architecture was needed and an extensive questionnaire needed to be completed before they could sign!  Within hours of being told of the need and the urgency, you responded with a detailed and thoughtful response that answered 99% of the client's questions.  When they came back with one last question you answered in minutes.  This urgency and attention to detail is what got us over the finish line with Citi and ensured that we closed this year and stayed on track with the client's launch plan.  Thanks so much for the excellent work delivered with a moment's notice!\n\n415#Signed, sealed - and secure!|Orlagh, a huge, huge thank you for helping us get our new recruiting software across the finish line!

I am confident it's going to be a fantastic (and secure!) partnership and I am grateful for your amazing effort as we closed the deal today! Thank you so much!\n\n416#SWAT Star|This is to thank you for getting stuck into your new role so quickly.

Out of that has come a new approach to managing our Security rhythm which will stand to us into the future not to mention the fact that it provided great comfort to the entire organisation that we were well protected going into the anniversary of our Incident. Espion commented that this initiative was so textbook perfect that they will use the approach themselves in future. Great Execution Orlagh, Well Done!\n\n417#Wells Fargo Wagon|Thank you for your dedication, preparation, and professionalism!  We have been undergoing a high level of scrutiny by Wells Fargo's technology team over the last several weeks. Their latest request involved having you on a WebEx at 6:30 on a Friday night.  You work hard for us and more importantly, you work hard for our clients. The tech manager from WF was impressed and said as much during our meeting. She was doubtful we could cover all the ground needed in our meeting, but she flew through her questions and your answers before she had to leave. She thanked you for being so prepared. I thank you for your support during this critical part of the process.\n\n418#Security @ Globoforce|Orlagh, It has been a pleasure working with you on the communications to support the internal security awareness campaign you've championed.
