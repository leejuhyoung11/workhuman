So thank you for helping me see what was around the several different corners - and accelerating progress on critical Certified relaunch priorities.\n\n2#Teamwork Central|I wanted to take the time to thank all of you for your hard work and dedication over these past few months as we’ve worked toward this massive expansion of our old Customer Center and ultimately unveiling the new Customer Central to all customers.

Whether you were developing the content, creating the massive number of images throughout the site, mapping the site layout, reviewing on a daily basis, integrating our access codes in Salesforce, assisting in a complete URL update, coordinating a massive email campaign, or helping me with one of my million requests, this was truly a team effort.

We are pacing to 10,000 MQLs for Q1 vs. a forecasted goal of 8,500. On behalf of Richard and myself, we wanted to recognize this core group for your willingness to sunset old practices that no longer served our growth goals (we mean you QBR), and replace them with agile, current, and dynamic approaches to generating performance insights, actioning trends, and week on week tight management of forecasts, actuals, and course adjustments. This represents and important discipline and newly developed \"muscle\" from work that began way back in October 2021 in support of our aggressive growth goals. You invested significant cross-functional time to develop an integrated 2022 Marketing Plan. And you keenly recognized that the plan may not go as planned. So rather to wait and react, you all committed to this business performance review format and week after week dug in to the detail of what was working and what wasn't, and rapidly responded to correct or accelerate where needed. Thank you for charging at this big goal with pragmatism, confidence, and courage. Onward to Q2! With gratitude, Chris and Richard.\n\n14#March ELT Update Contributions|That's a wrap for March. Team - our weekly Marketing updates for the ELT are getting better and better. Thank you for helping to showcase all the fine work, progress and RESULTS that are happening across the department.

You all nailed it!  From audience acquisition, to garnering fantastic talent for the show, to the ‘on the Streets of New York’ segment which I thought was a hit, to the carefully constructed questions and content to highlight the many opportunities and challenges facing HR today, not to mention the flawless streaming, it all came together extremely well and showcased our natural place as thought leaders and drivers of this important ‘future of work’ conversation.  Steve – you handled the job of navigating the conversations with Laurie, Steve and yes, even the unscripted Gary Vaynershuk too, like an absolute pro.  I’m excited about the demand this event will undoubtedly drive in the final weeks of Workhuman Live Atlanta registration, and equally as optimistic about our prospects for more Spotlight events and format testing in the future.   Thank you to this cross-functional team of trailblazers and innovators, and congratulations on a fantastic event!\n\n16#Spreading appreciation|Jill - thank you for your ongoing support!

She even said this was her \"dream company.\" Thank you for brining your dear friend into our WH Family. Daniella - thank you for all of your efforts during the recruitment process. You helped me and Lauren navigate the interesting situation that came up when she applied for one of our roles, but then we said \"Hey, let's see if she'd be up for this other role instead!\" Luckily she was, and it seems like a perfect fit! It's been a pleasure and a breeze working with you, and I'm excited to be working with you on the next new team member, too.

Without your efforts, we could not have reached so many end-users. Phil, thank you for helping to collect all the user data, and for helping to ensure we reached the full intended audience.

They have been very useful!\" Honestly, getting any comments back from customers is sometimes like pulling teeth, especially praise, so the fact that this long-standing customer took the time to highlight this deserves a shout-out from the rooftop!

You give everything your all, regardless of what you are working on, and always deliver! Just recently, I brought to you a situation where we had a customer who had several comp passes to WH Live San Antonio built in their contract, who wanted to come next year, but didnt have budget, and was wondering if we would still offer the comps for her and her boss. I had no idea where to take this, but knew I needed a quick turnaround given the circumstances. I brought it to you, and literally by the next day, you had the passes for me…AND you even took it a step further to figure out what other customers are in the same boat. By the next day, you came back with what other customers were impacted and had their passes ready to go, to deliver proactively which will no doubt drive up our registrations. This is just one of many examples of why you are the best partner ever! I just want you to know, on behalf of all of Customer Success, we SO appreciate everything that you do to support our teams and our customers- from the toolkits, to driving forward and communicating what marketing efforts are underway, to creating custom marketing campaigns when we need details on specific customers, to just always bringing a warm smile to our calls and the best jokes!

Clearly, in this particular case - it was nothing but success for the 2021 World Gratitude Day customer marketing program. I want you to know we are grateful for your unwavering support and leadership.\n\n53#Feeling inspired!|Team - I wanted to thank you for all your collaboration and hard work on reimagining the team awards landing page.  Revamping this landing page has been no easy task but this team came together to brainstorm ideas, rethink the design and flow, tweak messaging and the output shows! The new page (even in wireframe form!) really brings team awards to life in an inspiring, new way. We've received positive feedback across the board on the new direction of the page from stakeholders. Thank you again for all your work on this page!  I'm excited to see it come to life.\n\n54#You're my Jedi Master|Oh wise and powerful Jill.

Congratulations and celebrate the moment!!\n\n57#Fantastic Follow Up|Jill and Laura - thank you, thank you, thank you for all of your work on follow up programs for Spotlight.  Thanks to you, our team had the bandwidth to focus on preparing for and launching Workhuman Live 2022 promotions.  You are both always amazing partners to the events team, but the incremental effort to prioritize Spotlight amid many other priorities does not go unnoticed.  Thank you for your partnership, collaboration and teamwork.\n\n58#Truly grateful for your leadership and guidance|Jill, thank you SO much for all you do! This last month has been incredibly hectic yet you've exemplified (yet again) what ideal leadership looks like. In preparation for my paternity we've come across full workloads, tight timelines and still thrived to get ahead, and stay ahead! You have guided me to stay incredibly focused and prioritize which allowed me to stay flexible to accommodate juggling outside appointments with ease. THANK YOU!!\n\n59#Sparking Up Something Good!!|Allison, Erin and Jill, I wanted to thank all three of you for your help in positioning the spark series for absolute success! With great ideas come new processes and new ways of working, and I couldn't be happier to have passed off this first round of content on time and with little to no hiccups along the way. Each of you took the time to review and approve each piece, while adapting to an entirely new process for collaboration. While we still have a little way to go before everything is live, I'm so excited to see this vision come to fruition and I'm so so grateful for everyone's hard work!\n\n60#Customer collaboration|Jill, I just wanted to send a private message saying what a pleasure it is collaborating with you on all things customer marketing.  We just finished recording the monthly newsletter and, as always, you made it easy and fun.  Whenever we have new ideas on things like building a stable of guest presenters you jump on the ideas and action them every time.  (And you're one of the few people I trust to host the Customer Strategy huddles).  Working with you is always a pleasure.  Thanks for being you!\n\n61#Very important!|Jill - thank you for taking initiative to consolidate the cross-section of opportunities in our CRM and SFDC tools that will make us more effective at growing profitable sales. Many of these fall outside of core marketing and your leadership is appreciated. -C\n\n62#Sometimes, it takes a village|Team, I wanted to take a minute to thank you all for your support on our recent webinar promotions for the Lighthouse Effect webinar. Carrie, you did an amazing job weaving the “mood” of the World Gratitude Day brand creative into the promotional assets for this program. And you knocked the new social ad formats out of the park. Rachel, you did a phenomenal job on the email – building it in a super timely fashion with a keen eye for detail. Anthony, thank you for all your fancy footwork on the landing page for book requests. You got the page up faster than I could blink and did a stellar job at improvising when/where needed. Olivia, thank you for getting the promotions out the door and into market in such a timely manner. Jess, as always, you did an incredible job with the key takeaways doc - something that is extremely useful and appreciated by everyone, including the Sales team. Rachael, you managed the heck out of this program; keeping many balls in the air at once, reviewing and approving countless documents, following up in a timely fashion with all stakeholders, and thinking of every minor detail possible. Jill, Jason, and Taylor – thanks for all the support on the book order and with Sendoso. As a Sendoso rookie, I really appreciate the insights and knowledge that you all shared, and the assistance with managing the whole Sendoso program. Sometimes, it really does take a village! And in the end, this was our 2nd largest webinar by volume ever! Thanks for making it possible.\n\n63#Leveling Up Our Customer Game|Rich, thanks so much for taking the time to walk the team through a customer launch. It was really eye-opening to see the launch process and how an initial kick-off works. I love that the team was so focused and asked great questions. Looking forward to my continued education on this process!\n\n64#Gratitude for your FIRE!|To this incredible team of pros, I hope you are dancing alongside me (virtually) to our theme song! You are the Fire in the band! How lucky are we all to work together and make work for millions of people centered in gratitude?! I'm grateful for each of you every day and inspired by your passion, drive, and leadership. Dance a little, sing a little, and feel celebrated---Never was a cloudy day!\n\n65#Helping Hands!|Every once in a while you hit one of those weeks that is just really hard, but when you have people that you work with who step up and help without skipping a beat, it makes it so much easier to navigate. Jill and Mark, first it has been so great working closely with you lately. I am always energized by our conversations and learn so much from all of your knowledge and expertise. Secondly, I can not thank you enough for how supportive you have been, not just this past week, but in general. Thank you for being the definition of humans, working human!!\n\n66#K-P-I Oh My!|Team - outstanding job developing, vetting, socializing, and finalizing a set of Existing Customer marketing accountability metrics that align with the overall CS shared goals of growth. Superior work and great cross-functional partnership between Analytics, Marketing, and the CS business teams demonstrated here. I appreciate this team setting and achieving a goal to accomplish this work within Q3. With gratitude, -C\n\n67#Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner|Team - Congratulations on all of your hard work with Workhuman's submission to the 2021 HRO Today's Baker's Dozen Award program.  Because of you, Workhuman has claimed the #1 spot!!!   You should feel very proud of your work.  As the #1 Recognition vendor on the planet, we are able to launch a global brand campaign and acquisition campaign to educate HR leaders and practitioners about the urgent importance of making work more human.  Take a bow. You earned it.\n\n68#Product Enablement|Ladies!  Thank you for managing the product speaker segments for Spotlight - and providing all the details necessary to share with the Sales and Customer Success teams prior to launch.  We are always striving to provide the teams enough information about our events during the promotional period - and this can be challenging because we are typically building the content while promoting it.  Because of your efforts, we are able to provide a substantial preview of what to expect in the broadcast before we even launch - and that will certainly help as the teams do outreach to generate registrations.  I'll partner with you both any time!\n\n69#Customer Marketing <3|Jill, this week you set up a customer marketing sharing session with another team in the customer marketing world. In this session, we got to see how others are doing customer marketing at their company, talk to those in similar roles to us, share ideas, ask questions and more. It was so great to connect with other customer marketers.  I left this session feeling inspired and excited about all the things that are possible. I don't know how you make the time to do all the things you do for us but it is greatly appreciated. Thank for setting this sharing session up and for everything you do for our team!\n\n70#World's best pinch hitter|Jill, thank you SO much for pinch hitting for me while I was on vacation last week. You didn't just cover me, you exemplified yet again what an amazing leader you are and went well above and beyond. From coming back to perfect updates and recaps, to ensuring I really do unplug and spend the time with my family I literally can't thank you enough!!\n\n71#Respect for Quality QBRs!|With the pace of business and everything on our plates, it's easy to want to just keep your head down and march forward...However, it's important to stop, look back and evaluate the past. With the right mindset, the past offers lessons that can influence the future - helping us work smarter, make better marketing investment, strengthen our process, refine our messaging/creative and ultimately shape what we will test and optimize next. We wrap the 2Q'QBR up on Monday and I wanted to say THANK YOU to each of you for the time and effort you put into documenting and sharing key insights from your respective areas of marketing expertise. QBRs are an important part of the planning cycle and I am grateful for your commitment to them.\n\n72#Customer Newsletters delivered seamlessly|Jill and Allison, thank you so much for your partnership and dedication to quality as we put together these monthly customer newsletter videos.  You have worked hard to get the process refined to the point where we can deliver great insights in a sustainable way and your effort has not gone unnoticed.  You have gone out of your way on many occasions to make it easier on me personally as well.  It takes a real commitment to quality and customers to deliver something like this time and time again.  I just wanted you to know that it is wonderful to partner with you on it.\n\n73#Signed, sealed and delivered|I have lost track of the weeks we've spent working on the taxonomy that will support insights coming from 6sense, and I know there would have been many more weeks without this team. Thank you all for coming together to finalize, review, finalize, review, finalize, review and finalize the taxonomy for 6sense. Going through rows of data, building out taxonomy architecture and making it make business sense is not an easy task. And doing that along with your business as usual commitments is an even trickier tasks. Thank you team for making the time, reviewing the information and most of all investing in this effort. Looking forward to the impact that our work will have. Go team!\n\n74#The Mighty Growth Pod|Allison, Mark and Jill, thank you all so much for your help over the past week and a half! Allison - I seriously cannot thank you enough for the level of detail you provided me with in your pto handoff doc. You really took organization to the max here, allowing me to work on all the things with comfort and ease while you were on vacation! Mark - thank you for stepping in and helping me out with any and all questions / rogue issues that popped up while Allison was on pto. You're always a team player & it really means a lot! Jill - I appreciate you stepping in and helping me navigate these projects over the past few days. Whether it be providing approvals or filling in the missing details, your guidance here has been key to keeping up with the fast pace of these projects!\n\n75#Working Human Champions Unite!|I wanted to express my gratitude to this fine team of colleagues who have come together to share ideas, express concerns and TAKE ACTION to help shape the human experience and culture for our Marketing team. Your commitment goes way back to last fall when we formed the original Pulse Survey Groups but we reinvented ourselves about a month ago and decided there is strength in numbers. When you share a common goal and vision, it might make sense to join forces. And, wow...were we spot on. I love the collaboration and get giddy when hearing and seeing the larger group feed off each other's ideas. This group championed the DiSC workshop as our first official all hands L&D opportunity. This group helped reimagine the town hall as a platform to showcase the strong work and diverse voices across all of Marketing. This group is thinking ahead to what the next phase of work, when we step away from our Zoom calls and return to the office in some form or fashion, means for our newest marketers and everyone else that survived the last year+! This group is thoughtfully pulling together strategies to help foster the human connections that will inevitably make our team stronger and our work even better. It's a side hustle when we are all hustled out most days, but it matters and I genuinely appreciate your investment. We've only scratched the surface, but after receiving positive feedback on yesterday's town hall and coming off of a lively planning call with many of you earlier today regarding our next couple of initiatives, I am feeling optimistic about the journey we've chosen to take together. #btpftp THANK YOU for your commitment to me, to each other, to all of Marketing, and to working human!\n\n76#2H Global Marketing Plans|Team, I just wanted to thank everyone for their hard work and input on our 2H 2021 global marketing plans. I really appreciated all the thoughtful feedback and help along the way, very excited to get these into action!\n\n77#Interviewing Pros!|Thank you so much to this team for dedicating a whole morning to becoming MASTER interviewers! This was a huge time commitment, and I really appreciate that you spent your morning learning all about how to effectively interview at Workhuman. You were all so engaged throughout the session - asking questions and sharing your insights. Not to mention you were SO gracious with me when we had a couple of little hiccups (so many types of unconscious bias to define....and a whiny dog who refused to not go out). This was such an enjoyable session, and it was clear from your participation that you all really took it seriously and truly care about the quality of your interviews and hiring decisions. Thank you so much for taking this step in helping us to continue to hire the BEST talent at Workhuman!\n\n78#Keeping us heading the right direction|Thank you so much for all the help in the world of growth initiatives. The work you two have put into helping us move the ball forward on everything from lead-gen to Salesforce trainings has indispensable. We have a million things going on, somehow you two consistently make sure we are headed in the right direction. I cannot express enough how grateful I am to be on a team with you two! Great things are on the horizon!\n\n79#Of course you can!!|Jill, thank you for being a wonderful partner to Customer Success. This is just one example of the many requests that you take on & respond with imagination, collaboration & always such customer focus. I admire how positively you respond & how thoughtful you are in providing a solution, feedback or simply being open to a conversation. This slide is a great talking point during reviews, a good summary for those who would like to learn more or an education piece for a new PM, I love the detail & the links to learn more. We really value you & all that you do, great job!\n\n80#WHLO Retro|Thank you for completing the WHLO survey within the allotted timeframe. Your feedback is important to help drive improvements in how we work on future events. I appreciate your time and input. Your voice has been heard. Cheers!\n\n81#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n82#Customer moment of surprise and delight|Jill, Eileen and Alice, thank you all for jumping right in with both feet when we wanted to create a moment of surprise and delight for customers attendees at WH Live Online.  All of you brought ideas, action bias and urgency and we were able to quickly turn around a delightful surprise.  I've received a number of appreciative notes in response - including from the executive sponsor at our biggest customer - and your willingness to roll up the sleeves and jump right in was critical in making it happen.  Thank you!\n\n83#There's no stopping you!|Jill, is there anything you won't do for our customers? For WHLO, you drove the creation of an amazing enablement deck for our customer facing teams so they had everything they needed to support our customers pre and post event. Then, when the post event plans needed adjusting, you dove in and got the right people onboard, cleared blockers, developed content on the fly, and more. In the end, we were able to get out a great follow up email and resource out to customers...in record time. Thanks for all you do for us and for our customers! We could all learn a thing or two from you!\n\n84#Thinking again...and again and again|Team, what an adventure we have been! Diving into our Salesforce CRM from a customer and customer marketing perspective has brought our unique perspectives together to envision a data structure that can support our evolving organization. This week we started the process of mapping over 18 customer contact fields into three streamlined fields that will support our understanding of our relationship with contacts at individual customer organizations and streamline data management. This would would not have been possible without dedicated support from Chris on the Sales Ops side, continuous feedback from Cam and the vision that Jill and Mark have. Proud to be part of this work. Thank you for being great partners in this endeavor.\n\n85#Customer Communications|Jill, I can't thank you enough for your partnership in planning the Workhuman Live communications for customers.  Throughout the event planning process, you've shared your plans for customers, stayed updated on all the twists and turns, and been extremely flexible when things needed to shift.  I really appreciate your transparency, particularly this week, as we've had to make numerous pivots.  Because we've stayed connected on all the bits, its really helped me feel confident that we have all the bases covered.  Thank you, my friend!\n\n86#Ready, set, GO!|Team, I wanted to call out the amazing work and effort that was put in to prep the customer success team for great discussions and follow ups with the customers post the excitement of Workhuman Live Online. The team came together quickly and not only pulled together resources but also came up with actions for the team to take to keep the momentum going. Awesome work!!\n\n87#.....and go!|Wanted to take a moment to thank this team for coming together so quickly to bring an important DEI resource and landing page to life for our WHLO follow ups in a matter of days. From joining last minute meetings, to hunting down content, organizing chaotic schedules, recording a teaser video, and launching a new landing page - this team came together and made it happen. I think we're even ahead of schedule!  Appreciate everyone jumping in and helping us pull this off.\n\n88#Urgency and teamwork at its finest.|Under tight deadlines you two ALWAYS shine no matter the project. We have several projects with tight timelines running at once and we've been able to not just collaborate, but exceed milestones. Specifically for WHLO follow up, you've turned around revisions, pivoted, and kept the optimal customer experience always top of mind for us all. Jill, you lead us through everything so seamlessly all while challenging us to rethink what's possible to truly bring our marketing to the next level. Allison I can't even count how many times we've hoped on a quick call to work though a road bump, found a solution and ended up making the solution better than it was before there was an issue! I am SO grateful to work with both of you and look forward to future accomplishments, GSD!!!\n\n89#Starting strong|Jill, Chase and Kristen, thank you for taking the time this week to meet with Chris and I to talk about all things Customer Development. The meeting was informative, productive and even a little fun :) Thanks for also setting up a place in Sharepoint with really helpful examples of past work and metrics. I'm super excited for the opportunity to partner and do great things together, big or small.\n\n90#Meet Jill - A Shining Example for All.|Jill - this is long overdue but I wanted to recognize and thank you for consistently being SO GOOD. AT ALL THE THINGS. You never miss a deadline, you are always engaged in the process, in the meeting, in the discussion...whatever it may be - you are there. You are focused. You are positive. And you are doing your part to make us better. You are often the first to speak up, the first to volunteer for tasks or projects that come up. You are the first at a lot of things. And sometimes, when someone is \"first,\" it may be at the expense of quality. NOT the case with you though. You sacrifice nothing and have high standards for yourself and the team you lead. I want you to know that it comes through in all that you do. You lead the way...paving a path for others to follow. I am grateful for you and feel extremely fortunate to be your colleague. Thank you for being a super shining star and ideal role model for all of us - all day, every day.\n\n91#PTO Superheroes|Jill and Evan - wanted to thank you for all your help last week! While I was on PTO, there were a few things that were going to need reviews in order to keep the projects moving. You both were a huge help in ensuring teams got the reviews and approvals needed in order to keep these projects on track. I can't thank you enough! I was able to fully enjoy my PTO knowing things were in good hands with you two. Thank you again!\n\n92#Building the plane while we fly!|Jill - this has been to long in the making. I am simply in awe of your ability to manage all the different initiatives currently running. From building out strategies to help us grow the corporate/mid-mid market segments, building proper lead flows, and driving fixes to our contact data base. You are an incredibly valuable part of the team. I am so excited for the progress we have made since this time last year and cannot wait to see all of our future plans come to fruition. Each one of these initiatives will turn us into a growth machine with the ability to clearly identify and target our largest opportunities while still nurturing late bloomers. Amazing work and thank you!\n\n93#Always doing the doing (and the thinking!)|Jill, you know how much I (heart) you and your \"find a way to get it done\" mindset. Your creativity and internal knowledge are boundless! I could have given this same award and message for so many instances where you've been my rescuer and my \"go-to person\" to help out a customer, most recently with an ask from Air Products to help influence internal stakeholders and drive excitement around DEI efforts. You found and provided to me perfect materials to support the customer's ask. Thank you!\n\n94#Q2 Customer Strategy Team Meeting|Thank you all for making today's Q2 Customer Strategy Meeting a resounding success! (In order of appearance) Jill, Leslie, Jack and Jesse thank you for kicking us off by highlighting three key initiatives for 2021.  And thank you for your leadership on these projects and the clear, concise communication of the purpose and progress in each.  Well done! Alan, Erica, Isha, Meisha-Ann and Yi thank you for bringing the \"candy\"! Your section was filled with amazing insights, thought-provoking commentary and expert analysis.  You truly are pushing the boundaries of the industry forward.  Thank you (again) Jesse  for leading such a talented team of experts. And Dana, thank you for aligning all the logistics, for putting the story pieces together and keeping us all on track.  Well done everyone! Great meeting!\n\n95#A focus on our new humans|Hey Jill, I wanted to take a moment and recognize you for the effort you put in to our new humans. Onboarding can seem so dull and mundane to old hat employees but it's so exciting, fresh and fun to the new humans we're bringing on board our train! Thanks for the extra time and effort you're putting in to help make the presentation great.\n\n96#Departmental Security Review|Hi folks,  Thanks so much for taking part in our first departmental security review as part of our ISO27001 work.   We're looking forwards to using the results of the questionnaire as a way to increase the security alignment across the organization and we really appreciate the time and effort that people took in their responses!   best regards, Dermot\n\n97#All the progress!|Team - exceptional business review today! Great focus on results aligned to our growth goals. Thank you for your focus, hard work, discipline around evaluating performance and opportunties to accelerate further! Keep it up! These are important behaviors. -C\n\n98#THANK YOU FOR THANKING|Thank you all for your video submission for Employee Appreciation Day! While this day provides a wonderful reminder for all of us to reflect on the efforts and innovation that each of our humans bring to the table - we all know that our spirit of recognition and celebration is one that lives on all year long. There is no greater example of this in action than the recent call for video submissions from people leaders for an Employer Brand campaign. When we asked for some videos from people leaders thanking their team members, we were OVERWHELMED with video submissions - much more than we could incorporate into one or two snippet videos!  Your videos will remain live for all your team mates to see (see slack for link). Thank you all so much for taking the time to show your gratitude and enhancing our culture further. Even in this remote world you are all creating moments that matter, so thank you.\n\n99#Employee Appreciation Day - Thank You!|Jill, I wanted to formally thank you for the thoughtful package you sent over for Employee Appreciation Day. Unless I do some online shopping (which has been pretty frequent lately I'll admit), there really aren't many occasions where I find myself getting excited over opening mail anymore. Thank you for going out of your way to bring some fun to the occasion & the hand written note really sweetened the deal by hitting me right in the heart strings!\n\n100#Recognizing bp in a meaningful way|Thank you for taking the time to create congratulate bp on being named 'Best place to work LGBT+ Equality' by the Human Rights Campaign Foundadtion.  This is such an impressive milestone and one that has deep ties to our tenants of workplace rights.  It is amazing to see our customers leading the charge in making work more human.  And, it's even more amazing to watch our impressive group of talented humans come together to celebrate these moments.  Thank you!\n\n101#Employee Appreciation Day - Nailed it!|Jill, thank you for thinking of me when you sent your team gifts for EAD 2021. I don't really have a team, but you ALWAYS go out of your way to make me feel like a part of yours. As an individual contributor, it means so much to me to be invited to your weekly team meetings and included in your ongoing communications. The employee appreciation day gift was a lovely and unexpected surprise. It was perfect in every way. You might know my fashion sense better than my own family and I can't wait to crack open the cider. In big ways and small ways - all day, every day, you consistently fulfill my workplace right and human need TO BELONG. And I know many colleagues would say the same. My cup runneth over and I am grateful for you.\n\n102#Creative discussion partners!|Team, thank you for your participation, creative discussion and investment in our process of defining Marketing KPIs as we envision our plan for development. I was inspired and motivated by your expertise and feedback during our session yesterday. This has truly been a team effort held up by all humans involved! I'm excited to see where our imagination and determination take marketing analytics.\n\n103#Bridging the Gap!!|I'm not a fan of fire drills but they do happen! :-) LOLOL  I feel so blessed to have a team of \"first responders\" that pulled together a story on Certified's journey to help bridge the gap in understanding of where Certified began and where we aspire for it to grow.  Brian at the lead really assembled the right process owners (Brenda/Melanie) along with up to the minute digital insights and customer feedback & marketing analysis (Deb, Jill and Traci).  IN TWO DAYS!!!  TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK! Great work Everyone...\n\n104#Health First webinar is ready!|Thank you ALL for helping us pull of the webinar with Health First. From writing an abstract during the holidays and asking the customer for quick approval, we did it. And I thought that was amazing. But then cut forward to having to put the slides, story, content, and marketing together on an accelerated timeline! And you nailed it. I cannot stress enough how much each if you played a part in the successs and bring such a relatable story to our future customers. I am grateful for each of you. I want to thank you for being so open to collaboration, quick turnarounds, and emotional support during a busy time. I think the session was great and can’t wait for it to air on SHRM next week. I am truly grateful for each of you and the end result.\n\n105#Visibility 2021|It's February 18! We're almost halfway through the quarter! What a whirlwind 2021 has been. Thanks to this team of inspired minds for coming together this week to review detailed individual action plans for our strategic accounts and also coming together to share our biggest opportunities with each other. We all learn and grow so much together and I LOVE IT! Special shout out to our new BFF, Yuri!

From one fellow Frenchie owner to another, I've enjoyed every one of our conversations and I'm excited to hit the ground running once my onboarding is completed. Thank you for explaining the ins & outs of how team collaboration works here at WH & for bettering my understanding of each team's roles!  Kelsey - Sometimes you can just tell when you're going to get along great with someone, & you're a perfect example of that. From day 1, you made it clear that I can always come to you  if I have any questions or need someone to talk to. I truly value how welcoming you've been, and I look forward to hearing many more \"Would You Rather's\" in the future!   Kristen & Melissa - Thank you both for being so welcoming in our team meetings! I'm really looking forward to getting to know both of you better in the coming weeks, and I couldn't be more excited to be the newest addition to our incredible Customer Dev team!\n\n107#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n108#Seeking Ideas and Perspective from the Sparkle ERG|Jill - I wanted to commend your recent post on the Sparkle Slack channel where you asked for ideas to help Workhuman commemorate BP's award for \"Best place to work for LGBT + Equality.\"  This is such a great example of seeking new perspectives within our Workhuman ERGs. Our groups can help so many parts of the business and provide a ideal focus group - for not only their range of ideas but also their keen expertise for the subject matter within the ERG.  No doubt that the \"moment\" that is created will be even more impactful because of the insight you sought. Well done!   Kevin\n\n109#Wednesday night Zoom-around|Thanks everyone for showing up and contributing to a warm, fun and insightful zoom-around on Wednesday.  Not the same as an in-person conversation, of course but i really enjoyed spending some work-free time with you.  I hope you enjoyed listening and contributing to the 2 lies and 1 truth game we played .... never ceases to amaze me what stories we all have to tell and share.\n\n110#Amazing Breakouts!!|Many thanks to each of you who answered the call for breakout presenters.  You bravely came forward to share your knowledge, experience and expertise with our humans as part of Ignite 2021.  You spent countless hours preparing your sessions, designing slides and learning the ins and outs of Zoom technology all while adjusting to my many (and often changing) reminders!  We were able to offer a wide variety of topics and formats to all our Ignite attendees because of your efforts.  You did all this while still having all the typical demands of your job and your life.  Thank you for your commitment to providing a quality experience to your session participants that gave them tools, ideas and inspiration!\n\n111#Crafty Comms!|Jill, thank you for such a thoughtful and comprehensive Ignite breakout session today!  It was full of great insights, tips and resources with a side of humor and real-life applications.  You are truly a wealth of knowledge and excellent at your craft.  I appreciated having this dedicated time to dive deeper into the art of effective communication and look forward to putting the takeaways into practice! Thanks again!\n\n112#Breakout!|Jon, Jill, Stacey - On behalf of Patti and myself we wanted to recognize and say thank you for taking on individual break out session leadership during Ignite Day 2! Creating and giving people access to these forums helps them invest, learn, and grow. So important! Each of you bring expertise and SME-level knowledge to key areas like: wellness, social, and communications. Thank you for making the time to develop content and lead these sessions today. This was also a great professional development opportunity for each of you – proactively taking on risks/embracing new opportunities outside of BAU! With gratitude, -C\n\n113#Interview Extraordinaires!|Team, I wanted to take a quick moment to say thank you for all your help in the interview process for the Marketing Coordinator role. It was SO helpful to have all of your perspectives and insights on each candidate we spoke with.  I appreciate all the time and effort you dedicated to helping us find the right candidate for the role.  After quite a few interviews, we found a great candidate and I couldn't have done it without you! Thanks again!\n\n114#New Year Goals|Thank you all for providing your feedback on the speakers bureau as we closed out 2020. This recognition is long overdue (holiday brain) but it was extremely helpful to hear your goals for the new year to better understand how the bureau can support upcoming projects with speaking engagements. Whether you walked us through a planning deck, sent notes via email, or participated in an open dialogue - it all helped to shape our ‘21 planning efforts.\n\n115#Collaborations galore!|Jill and Allison- I feel like we talk every day (oh wait, we do) about a new initiative or something we need your assistance with, and you both jump in enthusiastically even when we need to pivot at the last minute.  This recognition is not only for the newest work we are doing for AWS, but goes back several months since I have been working with you all. Thank you for keeping your fingers on the pulse of what we need and for always jumping in to help! Our work continues... :)\n\n116#Crossing the Finish Line!!|Thank you... this is going to be an amazing 2021!!\n\n117#Putting in the work|Team - on behalf of Patti and myself, we wanted to say, \"Thank you\" and recognize the teamwork, collaboration, and effort you've collectively put in to moving our Pulse Survey action plans forward from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Together, we've made great quarter over quarter progress due to your efforts. This is an \"above and beyond\" initiative you've stepped up to lead. In doing so, you are each playing a leadership role for your marketing colleagues and peers - and - making a meaningful contribution to Patti, Tyler, and myself in building an amazing employee experience. This type of work is not the kind you can do \"every so often\" or \"sometimes\" and expect to achieve progress. It takes ongoing focus, a solutions-based outlook, courage and candor to build and sustain a great employee experience. Thank you for putting in the work - we look forward to continued advancements as we turn the page to 2021! With gratitude, -C\n\n118#Teamwork for the win!|Team, when a customer story basically LANDED in our laps late last week, we knew we’d need to move quickly and you all were fantastic!! Thry have a great story and we needed to make it EASY for the customer to say YES and you’ve done just that. We have met with them, shared an abstract, and a timeline and more about the next steps. Our customer has EVERYTHING she could possibly want in order to get approval. Thank you for advocating for customers and moving so quickly and efficiently. I hope we get to start 2021 off with their story!\n\n119#Truly Thoughtful!|Jill, thank you for including Anne and I in your team holiday get together today.  It was such a fun time with a mix of OG and NG (new guard).  Being on the events side, there has been so much flux in 2020.  Sort of a team, but also sort of fragmented.  Anne and I in particular have been a bit of an overlay for demand and customer all year, but not officially on either team.  You were so thoughtful to include us both as a natural part of your customer team – and we truly had so much fun reconnecting with everyone.  Thank you so very much!\n\n120#Always going above and beyond!|Jill I wanted to say thank you for all you do for our team. You go above and beyond to make our team feel heard, seen and appreciated. Always making time to catch up, check-in and ensure we have everything we need to be successful. Not only that, you’ve found a way to make Zoom fun again (did I just say that??). From sending lunch for a long planning meeting to breakout rooms so everyone has the space to share their perspectives, fun holiday packages and an even more fun holiday zoom party - I don’t know how you do it. I also love that you don’t just think of our team but you think of others as well. You’re a great example of a leader. Thanks for all you do!!\n\n121#Virtual Holiday Planning!|BIG shoutout for planning the best virtual holiday party! You've made the absolute best of the situations thrown our way in 2020 and we are SO grateful for the planning and coordination that went into it!\n\n122#Team POV (Yeah, you know me) Leaders|Jay and Jill - this is overdue for sure, but thank you for taking the lead on the Pulse Survey action group for the POV team.  You both jumped in to organize the group, put together slides to outline and organize the issues and wrangled the team together to share feedback and propose solutions.  In addition to everything you've both got going on in your \"day jobs\", you stepped up to take the lead on this \"extracurricular\" project.  It shows what great leaders and examples you are for all of us.\n\n123#But you \"made it work\" in 2020!|Team - Tim Gunn was right! We had very ambitious plans for 2020! And then they all changed to a \"different set\" of \"very ambitious\" endeavors and goals ... and you thrived, moved the organization forward to growth, and made sure businesses knew what's next, started now! Thank you for major contributions like: Implementing a data-driven approach to lead generation and pipeline growth resulting in significant growth of MQLs to 10,000!; Launching our first-ever TV and OTT ads; Helping executives unlock grand gestures of gratitude through Team Awards; Developing and delivering two WHLs (albeit in very different ways than originally planned); And helping grow our Employee Experience to rank on the Great Places to Work in 2020! Way to rock it out in 2020, and show 2021 a preview of what a human centered, impact driven approach looks like. Thank you for a terrific year of results, teamwork, support of our stakeholder partners, and resiliency through and through. With gratitude, -C\n\n124#Blood, sweat and tears|Jill and Chris, I cannot thank you enough for all the effort and energy you have been putting into building our customer pipeline for webinars (and all other marketing activities!). It feels at times like we’re trying to climb Mt Everest on stilts, but nevertheless we are making progress because of all you’re putting into it. Between our weekly catch-ups, the quick slack updates throughout the day, the customer stories squad, the meetings and conversations you’re having with CSMs, SCDs, Alice and the content team to make these webinars happen…you’ve given this so much of your attention (likely blood, sweat and tears too) and I hope you know how appreciative we all are for that! It’s a tricky dance we have to play with getting our customers on-board for these types of opportunities and you’re doing an amazing job. We never would have gotten Merck, Citizens or Baystate Health to share their stories  without your significant efforts. Thank you for all of it. I'm so grateful to being working with you both on this important initiative!\n\n125#C Ya L8r 2020!|As we head into next year, I feel so aligned with our team, and I'm so excited to tackle new challenges that come our way. You have both been a tireless advocate for us throughout the year and I wanted to thank you for such a successful year of challenges and changes. Our teams has gone from a 3 person tiny team to a fully functioning Customer Development crew. Thank you both for being such incredible leaders - can't wait to see what 2021 has in store for us!\n\n126#Action Planning our way to 2021|Rebecca, Traci, and Kristen, thanks to each of you for coming together and creating our action plans for Strategic Accounts from a S&C, Cx, and a Marketing perspective. Getting us all singing from the same song sheet is imperative for meeting our Moonshots for 2021. Thank you for diving in especially during the craziest end of year we've ever had. I'm so looking forward to working our plan and to celebrating success. Jill and Alice, thank you for supporting this effort and for your insights!\n\n127#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n128#Ready for a New Year!|Thanks to this very focused team of experts and leaders for creating something out of the tough 'hand' 2020 dealt us. Through all we've maneuvered through, I've consistently heard nothing but determination, strength, support for each other and for others, and a fierceness to overcome that is burned in my memory forever. As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking. Spending as much time as possible making things happen leaves little time for planning so all the more impressive how thoroughly you prepared to review action plans for each of your accounts. Thanks to our badass team of magicians, Traci and Rebecca for helping me pull off one of our greatest QBRs to date. Cheers to you all and to many more years of success together! You are all the magic of Christmas!\n\n129#2020 WH Holiday!|Just to tag on a few more thank you's... Jill - if you hadn't pulled the cross-functional group together and got us through that initial brainstorm, we wouldn't have ended up with this all encompassing plan - thank you! Angela, thank you for staying on top of all the moving pieces! We all know that when multiple departments are involved, things can rapidly change but you kept everyone and everything in line until the very last detail was done! Amanda - I am not sure how you managed to compile a list of so many different people in our \"community\" but you did! Thank you for helping to orchestrate something \"for the first time\"... you always seem to be a part of those types of projects. :)\n\n130#Words simply can't describe your leadership style|Jill, I was trying to find a word (or set of words) to describe and recognize everything you're doing for us - but I end up with a long laundry list of characteristics and behaviors. This year, you've guided us to crush every objective, held us accountable, empowered us to think differently and most importantly enjoyed the journey and laughed throughout. I personally can't thank you enough for all that you do, and rather than attach a CSV of the laundry list - I will just simply say thank you for all that you are doing and continually pushing us to improve ourselves!!\n\n131#Lights, Camera, Action Groups!|Team - Z and I want to thank you all for your work getting the Pulse Survey Action Groups kicked off. Your ideas we so thoughtful and well crafted for the short window we gave you. We are beyond impressed! As Chris said, this is hugely important work and it is ongoing. We are excited to continue our partnership with you as we build and develop out these programs! We are grateful for you all!\n\n132#Story Tellers|I can't describe the amazing feelings this team created when we all shared our personal stories and our vulnerabilities to each other.  There was a wonderful sense of connection and support that allowed us to create something special between everyone.  I know it wasn't easy (trust me!) and I want to thank all of you for taking the time to be open, honest and emotional.  There is no other company I have ever worked for that has had this connection between employees, and it was so incredibly special..  I am so happy to be a part of #teamawesome with all of you!\n\n133#Grateful for all you do!|As this time of thanks rolls around, I wanted to express sincerest gratitude for you. Having worked together on recent projects I have seen how you go above and beyond for every task, which shines through the end results. Have a wonderful, happy and safe Thanksgiving. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you in the rest of 2020 and beyond!\n\n134#Unwavering Support System|\"I am surrounded by the most supportive people who genuinely care about my development as a person and as a young professional\" - This was a text I sent my mom lol (I'm so lame). That being said, I wanted to thank you all for your seeing me, hearing me and offering me so much love and support throughout the second half of this year. This pandemic is rough on everyone for different reasons, but we need to help each other up during this time - and you have all been there for me throughout this process. Kristen, Thank you for being there to listen to me when I was struggling, stressed and confused. You helped me find solutions and brought in other individuals who were willing to help as well. I never thought it was possible to connect with a manager like this, but you make me feel so comfortable around you. Thank you for that. Jill, I wanted to thank you for your concerns and providing such sought-after advice -  you are always SO willing to help, no matter what. As our team grows, It has been amazing to get closer to work with you on projects and connect as humans. Tyler, Thank you for speaking with me and allowing me to pick your brain with all my questions! Hearing your personal stories and listening to your professional growth throughout the years is so reassuring. I am so lucky to be surrounded by people who genuinely care about my growth as a person and I know I am exactly where I should be. Thank you all!!!\n\n135#Thanks for your commitment to this journey!|Huge shout out to our esteemed colleagues on the inaugural Experience Task Force team!   Thank you for all of your support, patience, persistence, passion, participation, and continued commitment to the journey we're on together.  We know that the road hasn't always been clear, and perhaps a little bumpy while we've figured out how to navigate, but we've gotten to our first set of priority ideas to tackle for the buyer journey, which is awesome progress.  And choosing ones for the end-user journey is within sight!  You are part of this team because of the perspective you bring to the table while still always having the customer at the center, and we couldn't be more grateful.  This image captures the spirit that this team has - and can't wait to see the fruits and nuts of our labor!  Thank you again for being on this journey and foraging ahead!   (And may you always appreciate our corniness along the way 😉)  Sincerely,  Meghan and Alice\n\n136#The Planning QUEEN!|Jill, I just wanted to give you a HUGEEE shoutout for all the time and effort you put into our 2021 planning meeting today, it was a SMASH! Your humor and enthusiasm for our team is infections and I think you did such an amazing job of presenting the information in a digestible way. One of the things I LOVED about this meeting is that we all got to be a part of the brainstorming and contribute our ideas in small breakout sessions. You found a way to make a 2.5 hour zoom meeting feel like a 45 minute call, which is SO hard to do. It was incredible to hear our exciting ideas for 2021 and listen to our teammates contribute as well. You were even so kind to go out of your way and treat us all to a Panera lunch, so that we could fuel up and stay engaged throughout the entire meeting! Thank you for being such an incredible leader throughout 2020 and beyond, you are absolutely crushing it! Virtual round of applause for you!\n\n137#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n138#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n139#Supporting our customer team|Jill and Allison, thank you for taking the time today to discuss how we can be better at supporting the customer team when it comes to events.  You both were thoughtful and reflective in taking a step back and looking at how we work together, the specific needs of the team, resources, timing, and in general considering alternatives to make overall improvements that will drive us toward stronger performance in 2021.  It was a great discussion that I look forward to acting on for the next big event.\n\n140#A Team Approach to Professional Development|These days we are all under the same time restraints and stresses, but that wasn’t going to stop these rockstar teams from focusing on growth and development!  It was motivating to watch everyone quickly come together to tackle a multi-day, multi-session conference – making it possible to consume hours worth of content in a fraction of the time.  Thank you for thoughtfully recapping your sessions and sharing key findings.  The takeaways and ideas were inspiring and will help expedite the growth of our customer experience and marketing efforts.  And a special shout-out to Becky for organizing the entire process and keeping us on track!\n\n141#Pinky Swear!|Jill, I pinky swear... I will put a note on my calendar to think about the holiday card planning in early October of 2021. :) Love starting off a meeting with pinky swears. Seriously though, the way you brought the team together today to talk about the Holiday Greeting Strategy was impressive. You recognized this takes effort across various teams so you were sure to be inclusive. We talked about the needs of Customers, Future Customers and vendors, what's been done in the past, and what would make the most of our audience's experience this year. It was an effective meeting with a purposeful agenda to lock down ownership, strategy, and deliverables. Then, you shared your follow on notes which blew me away! Thank you for truly owning this project and giving it a great start!\n\n142#Congrats, you're a sinner!|WOO!! or should i say BOO!! Congrats to all our winners from this years Halloween slack events. Well done to you all for your participation and effort, Customer Marketing your submission was hilarious and on theme for our Murder Mystery event. Genessa with your delicious looking 4 legged s'more. Rich and batcat absolutely nailed it! Megan your little pup is just too cute and pretty popular, we're waiting for the instagram...Zhennaa we loved the door dress up, a level up on halloween decoration. Eileen, that zoom themed pumpkin was just too 2020 and it spooked us and Colleen in addition to this your life time supply of Oil of Olay is on the way.\n\n143#Ah ... Break out! (Don't freak out)|Z, Jill - Masterful job today introducing some \"next level\" technology for our Customer Marketing all hands. When we discussed the idea of simultaneous multiple break out rooms, you did not \"FREAK OUT\" - you stayed cool, and found a way to make it happen. Because of your willingness to try something new and put a new idea into action, we had an incredibly productive, fun, and even \"breezy\" 90-minute all hands. Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n144#Stupendous Support!!!|Jill and Kristen, it's so very hard to keep up with all the recognition you two deserve!  It seems like a VERY broad idea pops into my head and you two take it, run with it and develop it into something amazing and impactful!  Our bp \"Thank You\" video was perfection that was complimented all the way up to the CEO of bp in writing!!  You just can't get better than that!  You have helped with so many ideas, campaigns, drives etc all with enthusiasm and, best of all, with a ton of fun and excitement.  Your energy and zeal is infectious.  I so appreciate all the support and pure joy you both bring to the table.  Thank you so very much!\n\n145#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n146#Workhuman Certified Superstars|The words “thank you,” can’t begin to express the gratitude Brenda and I have for this team of talented colleagues who we’ve had the pleasure of working with to bring the Workplace Charter of Rights and Workhuman Certified to life. Whether you’ve been on this journey with us for the past year or the past month, you’ve all had a hand in helping us achieve our vision of changing the workplace for good. Our Marketing friends set the stage for success with a strong go-to-market strategy & brand design, an engaging web presence with compelling copy, customer pioneers to validate our program and tell their stories and customer “friendlies” to preview the program, influencer briefings, securing previous WH Live videos, and so much more! Our HR team challenged our new way of thinking about HR programs, helping to shape the Enterprise application process and ensuring we as a company were demonstrating progress in the Rights, while also preparing to educate and inform employees about this new initiative. And behind the scenes, our very own legal eagles were there to ensure everyone’s best interests were kept in mind. This is the largest cross-functional project we’ve been part of during our time at Workhuman, and we couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together. The saying is true…teamwork really does make the dream work! Thank you, all!\n\n147#Existing Customer Marketing Recaps - On Point!|Jill - I was just reading your weekly marketing recap...First of all - the work you and your team are focused on is in a word - PHENOMENAL. When you look at how much customers contribute to our overall bookings, you realize how ALL. THE. THINGS. you are driving from a marketing standpoint has a real impact on our business. Secondly, I suspect it takes a fair amount of time and energy to pull your recaps together but let me tell you, it's so lovely to have it all in one place - a treasure trove of bite size nuggets of content with visuals and hyperlinks to assets and/or more detail. We all know we can't all be everywhere all the time. Fortunately, for me your email is such a useful communication vehicle that helps me think about potential points of integration and in general, stay connected to all the amazing work your team is doing. I am sure I am not alone but I wanted to officially thank you for keeping us informed. I appreciate and look forward to your recap each week.\n\n148#Supporting All Things Customer Success|Ladies, this is a long overdue gratitude for all that you have helped support over the past few weeks and months.  Whether we have needed creative help for Here 2 Help or a campaign for the WH.com migration both of you have always been ready and willing to jump in.  Without your support we would not be able to showcase a polished one pager to help the triage support model pop.  Your creative juices are flowing and I truly believe this will help our Customers transition that much faster.  So, thank you for all your help and support.  We would not be ready for the next phase in Q1 without both of you!\n\n149#What is a stronger word for supportive?|To say that you have been a supportive manager over the last 7.5 months is an understatement.  In a time of great uncertainty and in this highly charged environment, you have gone out of your way to ensure that myself and the entire team feel connected, appreciated and useful.  You’ve led by example – setting up office hours, supplying agendas for all team meetings and providing notes that keep us all informed.  We more than doubled in size during this pandemic and we did so without massive growing pains because of your transparent, communicative and caring work style.  Thank you for taking the time to check in on our well-being, for strategically distributing workloads or for your constant understanding and flexibility.  Customer retention is more important than ever and I’m confident that under your leadership we are destined for great things.  Thank you, Jill!\n\n150#CAE Customer Spotlight|Jill, Chris - I wanted to give you both a shoutout for meeting with CAE last week and putting together a thoughtful, personalized deck on ways to highlight them as a company.  Lisa sent me a message afterwards excited about the possibility of making your ideas happen.  For me personally, I love to see that we not only value our client's partnerships, but we truly value the the work our customers do for their communities and their employees.  If that's not a sign Workhuman is a true partner, I don't know what is!  Celebrating our customer's achievements is a small thing we can do as a company, but it matters and is appreciated.  Also, an additional thank you for quickly shipping a copy of Making Work Human to all of them.  I know CAE shares our philosophy of bringing humanity back to the workplace and I'm excited about the future of our partnership.\n\n151#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n152#🙌🏻 Upleveling our Team Updates 🙌🏻|Week in and week out, each of you contribute to a few different communication vehicles we have to keep our team and stakeholders across the company up to date on all the amazing things that are happening in the world of Marketing. About a month or so ago, I came to the team with a new process for pulling together our weekly updates and challenged each of us to think about the intended audience and what would be most valuable to them...We started including more metrics and other performance data in our look-backs and introduced headlines to provide more focus. We are also incorporating more visuals to keep the content fresh and engaging. We held each other accountable to sticking to a standard template and hitting deadlines so that we could get the updates edited and out the door in a timely fashion. I know between the weekly marketing updates, the digital programming status reports and ELT progress updates, you probably feel like this is communication overload at times, but they are important in staying connected and current especially when we are all remote. I sincerely appreciate your part in helping to improve the quality. THANK YOU!\n\n153#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n154#Making gratitude look easy|Team, thank you all for your incredible ingenuity, creativity, partnership and support in helping to pull together all the customer resources for World Gratitude Day.  Each of you helped compile all the relevant materials that the Customer Success team was able to easily share out with customers in highlighting creative ways to celebrate this day.  I had never seen such a coordinated and detailed approach in packaging up materials that could so readily be put out into the hands of our customers.  Not only that, but you topped that off with coming up with such a great email to send to our customers celebrating them on World Gratitude Day.  The thoughtful approach you took in pulling this together was so impactful yet so simple to execute really had an impact on hundreds of our program teams.  You made it so easy for the Customer Success team to pull together a heartfelt message along with a picture or video thanking our customers for the opportunities we have to work with the world's best companies.  We received so many wonderful messages back from our program teams calling out how much they appreciated the partnership with Workhuman.  I am thankful for each of you and your help in executing a powerful number of moments that mattered for our clients.\n\n155#Partnering On Linkedin and Cisco DNI Opportunities|Chris and Jill, this is more than a thank you. This is an OMG, YOU TWO ARE THE MOST INCREDIBLY TALENTED, CREATIVE, AND WICKEDLY FUN PEOPLE TO COLLABORATE WITH, IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!  Marie and I came to you with a passion project: What if we could get the CDO at Cisco and the CDO at Linkedin on a virtual stage to share their thought leadership on building and sustaining inclusive and equitable cultures? And you both immediately embraced our dream as your own.   I mean, talk about taking an idea and running with it. You took what was a rough draft and helped develop a full fledged package. Thank you for taking the lead on creating the pitch deck, helping hone the value prop and positioning statements, and mapping out a comprehensive marketing strategy.   As if that wasn't enough, you came back with multiple abstracts to showcase the breadth and depth of our thinking to both CDOs, as well as innovative ways to get these incredibly important stories out to the masses.   And, Chris, I am blown away by your uncanny ability to not miss one single detail. You've kept us all aligned and progressing forward. Because of you, the momentum hasn't slowed down one bit. I can't tell you how fulfilling it is to partner with you both and how excited I am to see this all come to fruition.\n\n156#Shining the Spotlight on Baystate Health|Chris, Patti & Jill - we're embarking on an exciting opportunity to help showcase all the ways our client Baystate Health truly exemplifies working human - with the ultimate goal of generating a multi-channel \"good news\" communications package. We had a successful brainstorming call with their CHRO and VP of Marketing & Comms yesterday, and your contributions were the instrumental in sparking sincere interest from Baystate in collaborating with us on this project. Chris, you set the table for the conversation perfectly by reinforcing how much we value their partnership (5 years strong at this point) and why we want to share the remarkable story of how they've made their employees feel seen, heard and valued during these difficult pandemic times. Patti, you impressed them with your passion for telling these types of stories across our clients, and explaining why we believe Baystate to be at the forefront of organizations who truly embrace a culture of recognition and gratitude. Jill, you've been an amazing partner to work with on this project, always willing and available to offer your insights and top-notch content. Thanks to each of you. I'm excited to see where this project goes, and your contributions and leadership have set us up to be successful.\n\n157#GLG World Gratitude Day|Team, thank you so much for all of your help making the GLG WGD live stream a success. It started as a small idea from the client, and today everything came to life with your help. Lynette, you were so amazing on the live stream discussing Work Human and speaking with GLG's CHRO. Thank you everyone for bringing this idea to life, I am so grateful!\n\n158#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n159#Making it all about THEM|Thank you for meeting earlier this week to wrestle with the eternal question: \"What matters most to senior leaders at our top accounts?\".  The thoughtful, candid and creative ideas you brought to the table are going to help immensly as we develop the Insider Insights session for our key accounts.  And when we put customers at the center and consider their perspective, we guarantee success!\n\n160#I'm Grateful for YOU!!!!|To the AMAZING World Gratitude Day team - you have inspired me to start my gratitude journal right here, right now.

Melissa F, thank you for always being a tremendous partner, thinking through every detail, trying out new technology, making the process as easy as possible for CSMs and smiling through the numerous rounds of edits, link checks, and late night madness! Sarah, your creative skills lead the way with the WGD visual campaign consisting of not one, but two, concept options, the WeTransfer personalized background and much more! (3) I'm grateful for our customers like Merck, UHG and Schneider Electric who within minutes of receiving the email with the toolkit stated they can't wait to leverage a number of the assets in the toolkit!! Gratitude is a wonderful thing. It makes what is EXCELLENT in others belong to us as well!! Thank you for sharing your excellence with me and the world!! YOU ROCK!!\n\n161#7 Habits –Framingham Graduates –Class of June 2020|“MOTIVATION is what gets you started. HABIT is what keeps you going.\" - Jim Rohn.

From beginning to end, you have both been so invested in this program and it has had such a tremendous impact on the way you have lead our team. Being a part of this course with you has been inspiring and has pushed me to get the most out of it. Show up and get the most out of the classes. Yes, it was time consuming, but you always managed to make the time and finish strong and make it through until the end. It has been so amazing to see both of you apply your learnings to our everyday lives at Workhuman. Keep it up!!\n\n163#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n164#Marketing Leadership|Jill – this recognition is long overdue. I want to acknowledge the leadership you have shown, not only on the marketing team, but in the organization. Your commitment to building and executing on a robust customer marketing plan is admirable. You clearly define your goals, strategy, and tactics, and take the time to communicate these to the team. You take a collaborative approach to working with your colleagues, and are always prepared, present, and on time to Zoom meetings. This demonstrates great respect to everyone’s time, which is precious given the volume of deliverables we each have. I appreciate your partnership with how content ties into your campaigns, and you take the time to talk through what is working while identifying gaps. Keep up the excellent work and thanks for all you do.\n\n165#Our Fearless Leaders!|Jill and Kristen I wanted to take a moment to thank you two for all your hard work that has gone into Q3 planning and beyond. SERIOUSLY, you guys are crushing it! I see how much time and effort that has gone into these plans and they are so well thought out. It feels so good to know that Customer Development has a fully-baked plan of attack for the coming months, and it is so nice to work proactively for a change!! You guys are so inspiring and I wanted to let you know that I am so grateful to learn from two bad A$$ lady leaders! Q3 has no idea whats coming!!\n\n166#Finding our social diamond in the rough|I want to thank you all for being an amazing interview panel for our director of social media position. You each are bringing amazing perspectives and insights into the role and your feedback is so incredibly valuable. We've got high standards to ensure we bring in the right candidate that is going to elevate this team, grow this function and be that wonderful team lead. While we haven't found them (yet!), I am so grateful to your candid feedback and commitment to working with us on getting to that gem.\n\n167#Teamwork makes the dream work!|Team - so excited to see the collaborative work, cross-functional thinking and strategic planning going into our 2H approach. It is holistic, considers the bigger picture, and was well articulated. Look out Q3, here we come! -C\n\n168#Chip Chip Chipping away to deliver SUCCESS!|Jill, I want to take a second to say a HUGE thank you for the sheer determination, positive energy, and effort that you have put in to partnering on the Customer Story project with me.  You sought to understand the win win we needed to obtain for sales, marketing, customer success and of course the customer! Trying to align 3 department's needs in a cohesive way to deliver an exciting and customized customer facing deck that best positions our desire to celebrate our customers for working human in a way that plants seeds for Workhuman Certified and delivers sales enablement and marketing assets that are exciting, innovative and desirable is NO SMALL FEAT!  Thank you for your determination to make it happen, for your commitment to quality and for your speed in engaging with the relevant teams to lay the foundation that we needed in place!  We are off to a great start and now with the help of brand and creative we are almost there!  Like this picture there have been many times that it seemed that we had reached a dead end but each time we dusted ourselves off and pivoted as needed!  Thank you for not letting the frustrations get to you and for being a GREAT partner!  I love being in the trenches with you!  We are nearly there, and it will be AMAZING!  Thank you!\n\n169#Winning!|Jill, over the last few months as we have all worked to adjust to this new way of life (and work), I have noticed time and time again how you go above and beyond. Although I've never lived through a pandemic, I've experienced instances where people have the opportunity to shine and to lead when maybe others cannot. You have been steadfast in your leadership! While so many others keep asking 'is 2020 over yet?' joking or not, you have embraced it and continued to deliver at the highest level. You are a no excuse, get sh*t done kinda gal and we love you for it! I am sometimes almost speechless (I know rare!) when i join and see all that you have STILL managed to tackle against the odds. Here there and everywhere!. What pandemic? You must not sleep. Thank you for all that you are doing, every bit of effort you put into every call, interaction and project. You and the team you have built are producing work that is turning heads ... because it is amazing. THANK YOU!\n\n170#Non-stop Jill!|Jill - This is very overdue. ...Honestly, do you sleep? 😉 With so many moving parts, you are always responding to the constant WorkFront updates at ALL hours. Since the pandemic, you and your team have been tasked with how to reach our customers given the \"new normal\". You are forward-thinking with all these initiatives, and willing to collaborate across departments to get the best results. In addition, as we're trying to implement new processes, you're always onboard and willing to partner with the project management team. Thank you for all your hard work for our customer outreach, for being a great team player, and for always implementing the comic relief along the way.\n\n171#Putting the \"Lift off\" in \"Kick off\"|Team - as workplaces everywhere contemplate the next phase of work, we are leading the way in what that looks like externally and with our customers. It also means we need to evolve internally. I was so impressed by the team work and open mindedness demonstrated by this cross-functional group in today's kick off! So, as they say, \"Houston, we have lift off!\" Excited to see where this group takes the next phase of what it means to thrive and workhuman. With gratitude, -C\n\n172#A true moment that mattered!|All, On behalf of the entire HR team, we want to thank you so much for the amazing video you put together for us! The team was speechless, so shocked and also so incredibly grateful to all who took the time to make this happen. This is what moments that matter is all about... a true human moment of surprise and delight but more important, genuine care. The HR team Slack channel was  buzzing after the video played, with heartfelt messages from the team, so wanted to share some of the sentiments.. \"What a moment of \"surprise & delight\" indeed! It's rare HR gets a shout out, let alone a dedicated video. Very sweet and thoughtful.\" \"I am speechless.. just wow\" \"I was bawling.. so sweet.. goosebumps\" \"i am pretty blown away by that\" \"Lovely surprise! Well done team!\" \"the genuine appreciation was so evident.\" \"the video made my Friday and reminded us why what all of us do here is so special!!\"  Thank you all again for taking the time to think of us, for creating this very special moment and for living our values to the fullest!  Much love, your humans behind the humans!\n\n173#Open and Honest|Thank you for allowing there to be an open dialogue with both myself and the team as a whole. The openness and honesty that we have is like none other and it allows us all to be able to speak up and tell you what we really feel. That's a very special thing and I'm grateful I'm in a place where I can make my voice heard without being afraid to do so.\n\n174#First impressions|Jill - a quick shoutout to you for all thought and energy you've put into up-leveling the various marketing presentations our team gives to our new hires. You put for a recommendation to all the Marketing directors last week, gathered input from all of us and collaborated with Sharon to make sure that our streamlined and cohesive approach would meet the objectives of the onboarding program for Workhuman. We all know from firsthand experience that there's a lot to digest as a new hire and you've made sure we share the right level of information at the right time. Now the fun part begins in creating the new presentation materials based on the foundation you've established for us! This project has been on the back burner for a while without an official owner, so I really admire and appreciate the initiative you have taken to improve our department's first impression to new humans that join our family. Thank you for your leadership!\n\n175#Tried and True Teammate|Jill, when I think of a person who is ever-reliable, responsive, and ready to help in whatever way possible, you are at the top of that list. I want to thank you for continuously and consistently being someone to rely on, even when it's out of the scope of your day to day - and especially when you're juggling a million and one other things. You are always at the ready to patiently answer questions and give clarity around customer projects. You hop on calls at the drop of a hat. You answer slacks within seconds. You are poised to roll up your sleeves at any given moment to get something done, even if it's for a project you're not running. Just this week I've come to you a few times to nail down some tasks. You also offered to facilitate getting customer quote approval for an acquisition project. All of this you do without hesitation, but instead with a completely genuine team spirit and the best of humor. You're awesome and I don't tell you enough, but I sure appreciate you and all you do for this department.\n\n176#Customer Champion|You are the ultimate customer champion!  Thanks so much for all the time dedicated to reviewing the Livestream follow up plans for customers - helping guide me through the different segment needs and always being available to provide feedback, direction, and recommendations.  Even when you're on PTO!  It's always a pleasure to collaborate with you and I especially appreciate your help on the Livestream project!\n\n177#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n178#Hand in Glove|Team - we are running at such a high pace that there's always the risk of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. You've demonstrated behaviors and teamwork that is the exact opposite - more like Hand in Glove level of coordination and alignment. Thank you for developing a process \"light\" engagement model for best serving our business while leveraging our customers in a smart and targeted way. More importantly, you clearly outlined and communicated this process effectively and concisely at our Marketing town hall today. With gratitude, -C\n\n179#Powerful Communications Pack a Punch|Eileen, Jill & Kristen,  I wanted to say a huge THANK YOU to each of you for creating an incredible communication tool for the SCDs for the upcoming Livestream.  It was so amazing to have the perfect foundational pieces for our invitations and outreach.  I can't tell you how much easier it was thanks to all of your hard work.  We always hear that teamwork makes the dream work and it couldn't be more true in this instance.  Thank you to all of you, you don't know how much we all appreciated the effort!\n\n180#Leadership Skills Soaring High!|Jill, I just met with your latest 'new hire' who told me that this is his first job out of college. I asked him with zero expectations what he thought customer experience was... so I could gauge where to begin. :) In all the conversations I have had internally and externally with people about what customer experience is... Jeff gave the best/simplest response. I am not sure if it was because I did not expect him to know given he is just starting out and also because so many have it confused (we are on a journey!) but WOW. This goes directly back to you and your amazing leadership. Jeff told me that he had already heard about our team and some projects from you. At a time when things are so chaotic and it is even more challenging to stay connected - you are soaring high. I am super impressed by what he has retained so far and it's only been weeks. You and your team are doing phenomenal despite the obstacles in this new way of working. I can't imagine how difficult it must be to on-board someone and on top of that... it being their very first job. On behalf of CX, thank you for making our job easier!!\n\n181#Wait! Was that really only 90 days?!|Team - Thank you for making this next phase of our journey and evolution together as a team so successful! Lets just say the first 60 day together were much different than our last 30 days together(ish)! Wanted to celebrate all we’ve done together in our first 3 months as a team. Attached is my quick recap and where I see us delivering results in Q2. Thank you, I’m truly appreciative of all you do!  With gratitude, -C\n\n182#Thoughtful Input for Livestream Follow Up|Fellow marketing peeps - thanks for taking time out of your busy schedules this week to talk through the communication plans for Livestream follow up.  Since the audience for Livestream is so diverse, spanning customers, prospects and SMB groups, the follow up planning needs to deliver the right message to each group to deliver on the business goals.  Your input was invaluable in guiding the direction the plan is taking for each segment.  It's not final yet, but I think we're on the right path and I thank each of you for sharing your thoughts and suggestions with me.  Have a great weekend all!\n\n183#Marketing Rockstars|Jill and Kristen, thank you for everything you’ve done with Dell.   When they started considering internal changes to the program, you took immediate action and (somewhat miraculously) delivered a social surround campaign overnight for their executive team.  I’m overwhelmed by your endless support and partnership. You ladies spearhead all of the customer marketing opportunities for our top accounts; from account based marketing plans, social surround campaigns, COVID marketing playbooks, WHL recruiting efforts - this list goes on and on! You go over and above to support our team.\n\n184#Keeping Our Ship Afloat|I must commend you both on such an outstanding job you have been doing over these past few weeks. You have continuously managed to keep our team on track, despite the roadblocks and changes we may have hit along the way. Not only have you been handling multiple projects of your own, but you’ve also been able to jump in to help Jeff and I with certain tasks as well.    Kristen, your optimism and honesty have kept me going these past few weeks… and I mean that! Even our quick little video check-in or encouraging slack gives me the boost I need to push through the day and finish strong. These past few weeks have been hard on everyone and some days are harder than others, but I just wanted to thank you for your patience and encouraging mindset throughout this transition.   Jill, your availability to jump in and help during the Merck Webinar has been tremendously helpful. With this project moving so quickly, it has been a difficult one to reign this one in on my own. You are a wealth of knowledge and I have learned so much from you as our small but mighty customer development team has taken shape. Thank you for always being there to bounce questions off of and keep us informed on all things Workhuman.   With all our unique work schedules and juggling acts, I wanted to let you guys know that you are doing an outstanding job as managers and role models. Thank you!\n\n185#Thank You Healthcare Images - Weekend Worriors|Thank you all for jumping in to take part in the logo and image sourcing and uploading for hospitals into the Thank You Healthcare site!  Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring! Thank you also to each of you who dedicated an hour, several hours and in some cases most of the weekend to sourcing and uploading!  We so appreciate your efforts!  Many hands make light work, my mother used to say! I do want to call out a few of you who really made an incredible dent in the project uploading and sourcing between 70 and 230 images each and in many cases hitting both uploading and sourcing!  WOW!  Brian Moore, Matt Durgin, John Wamback, Jon Bizeur, Amanda Salvas, Rich Sorrentino, Jillian Gregoriou and Dan Fiore, you guys are complete rock stars and your contributions were mammoth! This was a true team effort and to see it in action makes me so proud to be a part of our Workhuman family!  Amazing job! Let’s share some gratitude with the world now!\n\n186#A second home (in my basement)|All three of you have done such an awesome job helping me get ramped up the last 3 weeks. Starting remote is definitely a weird feeling but each of you have helped me feel like I have a home here. These are tough times, but I am so grateful to be surrounded by people like you. I can't wait to get to the office and see each one of you in person every day instead of through just a screen! Thank you so much!\n\n187#Urgency + Energy + Intelligence|I wanted to thank this group for your speedy help launching a set of LinkedIn ads for an important customer this week.  You each acted quickly, asked valuable questions and made efficient decisions. And while this request was for just one customer, you’ve worked in a way that will enable us to use this ad set for a larger group.  Working remote can come with challenges, but the communication and fast responses from this group made it easy.  Thank you!\n\n188#LinkedIn Elevate Superheroes|First, all of you deserve a massive round of applause for your extraordinary use of LinkedIn Elevate. You have all won the battle amongst your departments for the most amount of content pushed to your social networks in this past quarter. On top of this, each of you has contributed to a social media tidal wave that has earned the company over $50K in social media value over just Q1 alone and the social team is wildly gracious for this. Elevate has seen great success and it continues with your exemplary use. A big thanks to each of you and a cheer to continued super-user status!\n\n189#Best. Team. Ever.|Thank you for a great Zoom meeting to align around our short term priorities while daring to dream and proactively plan for longer term priorities. Not an easy task to do when the \"here and now\" is all anyone of us can think about lately. I was so impressed with everyone's willingness to think about team resources in a different way and also our shared commitment to the good work and strategic thinking that we already did together pre COVID-19 crisis. This was my most productive meeting of the day and an awesome way to end the week. I am grateful for this awesome team. Thank you!\n\n190#CSR Committee|A heartfelt note of gratitude for your overwhelming and immediate support of our CSR initiative. In the midst of all that is unfolding across the company as we respond to COVID-19, you found the time to join our little committee and came up with several outstanding ideas in no time at all! We are rallying around those ideas and from it will emerge a short and long-term plan to further our impact on lives and communities. Onward and forward!\n\n191#Communication All Stars|Technology should enhance good communication.  You are all getting this award because you have embraced our technology over the last few weeks in the way it was intended. You’ve helped project management in supporting you in projects By uploading docs, putting in requests, communicating and tagging team members.  The way we use this tool today will help us to a more refined way of working as we move forward.   Thank you!\n\n192#Draft after draft|Jill, I know that title sounds exciting.  Unfortunately it's not that kind of draft.  It is version after version of customer communications.  All day.  Every day.  For over a week now.  I couldn't think of anyone better to be alongside on this journey.  I appreciate your commitment to quality, the open and candid feedback, the flexibility in design, the creative input regarding content and especially all the laughs and Slack messages.  I'm grateful for your partnership.\n\n193#CREATING A WAVE of GRATITUDE|Can you feel it? It's a soul lifting, soaking you to the bone, crashing wave of gratitude and joy that is emanating from this group of people. There are SO many ways this team of people is banding together, ideating, taking action, sharing, and LIFTING our customers (and each other) in this incredible hectic time! I just want to take a moment to say thank you for working through this time of uncertainty with your hearts on your sleeve. For reaching out to customers and giving them strength and light and the power to do good. If there was ever a team meant for the right now, it's this team. Thank you from leading from each of your seats and for creating incredible opportunities on a daily basis for our customers, for our brand, and for our business! You're ALL HEART and I'm loving it!!!\n\n194#But also Respect for Urgency, Respect For all, etc|Hey Jill, I wanted to throw some #madprops your way for handling the past few days and next-level back and forth that has come with them with agility and grace. As the new guy, I don't always know what's business-as-usual and what's above-and-beyond, but I'd have to be as thick as a brick to miss the extra effort you're putting in. Your positivity and openness to collaboration has inspired me to handle my (occasionally hectic) self with equal level-headedness, and I'm looking forward to keeping this party rolling.\n\n195#And Thank YOU, team!|I wanted to recognize you all for being a part of the amazing Healthcare Thank you Video we launched to our customers and social channels yesterday afternoon. This was both a great initiative to showcase our respect for our customers and all members in the healthcare industry, as well as such a great team collaboration. Each and every one of you played a crucial part in making this so successful.   I was personally excited and touched by this video since I have so many family members and close friends in the front lines, and I'm so excited to share with them to brighten their day!\n\n196#Well that was NOT in my 30/60/90 day plan! ...|Team - A quick thank you to celebrate being 60 days in together. You continue to adapt to the businesses needs and lead through uncertain times with a high demonstrated commitment to the priorities we've aligned on to grow the business - ie., Build the brand; Acquire new customer; Grow existing customers; and Build our culture through people. Although COVID was in NO ONE'S playbook, you rallied and risen to this new challenge by partnering with me on a slightly \"revised\" version of my 30/60/90 plan. This is having such a positive halo effect on our teams. Look forward to the next 30 days of the plan ... whatever that looks, and with confidence that if we need to write it 1 page, 1 day at a time - this is the team I'm excited to do it with. Stay healthy, human, and connected! With gratitude, -C\n\n197#Now that's what a call teamwork!|Jill, Jeff - what do you do when you lose power while working from home amidst COVID crisis? The only logical thing, drive to a colleague's house and work in their garage. True teamwork, determination, and grit. Amazing example of teamwork and commitment to the business and each other. With gratitude, C\n\n198#You Are A Warrior|We all know that you are a hard worker, but last week you went into an entirely new gear.  You worked tirelessly to keep groups aligned, you were quick to respond and executed at lighting speed, and you managed to do this all while keeping the customer needs front and center.  Thank you for stepping up as a leader to guide us through a tricky week and for showcasing what good marketing can look like during a  time of crisis.  I would go into any battle with you.  Bring. It. On.\n\n199#Demand Gen Strong|Team, this is long overdue!  I want to thank each of you for welcoming me to the team and taking time to help me get up to speed on all things Workhuman.  It’s such a pleasure to work on a team that is so supportive of one another.  Miss seeing you all everyday, but until we are back in the office, I look forward to the daily slack conversations and, of course, the dad jokes.\n\n200#What a Ride!|Jill - I have to call out the quick and strong partnership we have built over the past three weeks. It's been one crazy ride! We went from planning WHL customer acquisition, to 1% of payroll, to recognition in difficult times, to COVID-19, and finally to the amazing offer of Life Events and Conversations at no cost to customers.  That is 5 topics in three weeks. Each time required a quick pivot, realignment, and plan of action. I cannot say enough about your organization, communication, and attitude through all of this. I feel incredibly lucky to be working along side such talent and dedication. I know this team is headed for great things. Thank you Jill!\n\n201#Is it still Wednesday?|Team -  First, thank you - often and always.  Second, I want to acknowledge we are operating in unprecedented times. This can trigger feelings of discomfort and anxiety if you let it. But, I believe we are strong enough together to rally, support, and mobilize each other to overcome that potential because you all as leaders already have. Know that every moment of progress you’ve made this week already illustrates your strength, determination, and grit.  In the broader context - none of us are guaranteed a tomorrow - COVID may exacerbate that mindset - but in reality this too shall pass and we all will be stronger from it - personally and professionally.  I believe in you. And I believe in us together. Our collective strengths to overcome and our true human spirit to persevere will best this.  I am honored to serve alongside you in the pursuit of our brand, our customers, and the greater community we serve.  Thank you for all your support, kindness, and compassion you've extended to me this week!  With gratitude, -C\n\n202#Stay connected!|Thank you all for your honest feedback, smart editing, inspiring ideas and perseverance in getting the customer communication out yesterday.  The first is always the hardest when we have to get the tone, template, style and length right. Kevin, your timely assistance and editing were key. Eileen, your help in getting to the point and sorting out the structure made it pop.  Traci, you bring a dose of humanity and energy and this was no exception.  (Hello Humans!) And Jill, without you we would have been lost.  Templates and email alias and lists...oh my!  You have the patience of a saint.  It will be so much easier from here!  I am grateful to work alongside such talented and passionate colleagues.  Thank you!\n\n203#Quick strike team|Hi all - thank you for your tireless collaboration today on all of the different email communications that we're putting out into the world. You've each been wonderful to work with - Jill and Z, providing clarity of direction; Lauren being quick with all the words; John, keeping the tasks organized and all of us on track... Great teamwork, respect for urgency and respect for quality all around. I love that amidst uncertainty - we can still shine! (yep, that was cheesy and i don't care)\n\n204#A Virtual First|Anne, Diane, Holly, Jeff, Jill, Kelsey and Kristen – thank you so much for the call that turned into my first virtual birthday party ever! Talk about staying connected in times of uncertainty and virtual human moments that matter! You all are so thoughtful and caring. Today had the potential to be a bit glum between all the craziness that is COVID, the mandatory isolation and the dreary weather but you have made sure to add a whole lot of light and laughter into my day. Thanks for all the love and thoughtfulness – I have certainly felt it! Best. Teammates. Ever.\n\n205#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n206#First Class Collaboration|Team! I wanted to say congratulations and celebrate the collaboration that infused our FY20 Marketing Strategy Board. As of this past Friday we have an aligned, crisp, and clear plan for Marketing's focus and KPIs that sits perfectly between the Company's goals, objectives, and major priorities. I also want to recognize the diligence that went into to making this be a plan that effectively spans Customer + Brand Marketing and reflects alignment with our key partners (SLT, CS, CX, and Finance). It is metrics driven to ensure accountability and through it's more streamlined nature, now infinitely more shareable with our teams and partners. Look forward to rolling this out to the teams through all hands these next two weeks and continuing to revisit it for focus, alignment, and relevance to the business's needs as our business evolves. Love to see the positive momentum and teamwork modeled to produce this output - lets keep it going. With gratitude, -C\n\n207#New Hire Celebration!|Jill - congratulations on your new *AMAZING* hire, Jeff Ellis! Thank you so much for being an incredible partner from start to finish - from providing me with industry insight and knowledge at our initial kick off, to your optimism and thoughtful consideration throughout the phone screening and interview process, and your quick, transparent cadence. For all of these reasons and then some, we were able to make this quality hire in a mere 18 days since req approval! I am so excited to see the successes Jeff accomplishes on your team, and cannot wait to work with you again in the future!\n\n208#Schneider Slam!|What a journey this has been. We first thought about how we could personalise and target Schneider executives and teams for WHL back in November, an idea was quickly weaponised with amazing collaboration, velocity and passion from Jill, Kristen and Kelsey. Our ability to be agile and pivot around our clients, not to be afraid to try new approaches and making things happen are virtues we seek everyday as humans. How fortunate I am that I am aligned to such a great team. We have had a massive response from Schneider and they are super excited about WHL this year. Thank you for the great work you all do and here's to the next initiative!\n\n209#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n210#Last minute ask|On top of your day jobs, I asked each of you to present in our weekly marketing directors+ meeting today - without a ton of notice. You produced slides, shared great content, and kept the team engaged during your sessions. Thank you for embracing the new format for our weekly meeting which we tried for the first time today, and contributing to what felt like one of our best meetings to date!\n\n211#\"Celebrating\" Takeda|A huge THANK YOU and CONGRATULATIONS to this team for getting the Takeda contract over the goal line!  I have felt so privileged and inspired to work with each of you throughout this process. Tim, you truly defined what it means to be a great partner both Takeda and myself.  The trust you have built with them is beyond measure!  Steve, this has been a wild ride and your partnership has been invaluable.  From moment one you truly listened, came to the table with creative approaches and showed Takeda  and myself nothing but respect. Hillary, we have been joined at the hip since Baxalta!  It has been a roller coaster since this partnership started and you were there in a moment’s notice, incredibly focused on helping us get to the right result and a true class act!  Michael, I honestly couldn’t have made it through the RFP process without you.  You bring such a positive attitude and make a very daunting task enjoyable just by being you.  Like I have always said, no big deals get done in this company without you.  Greg, you always bring insights and a vision that are irrefutable.  No matter what the challenge, you brought a fresh perspective, helped to define the true story at Takeda and help to differentiate Workhuman.  Jill, you brought so much energy and positivity to this process.  You jumped right in to help bring Workhuman to life for Takeda.  Lots of back and forth to help us get the LinkedIn ads perfect, the microsite perfect, our communications to executives perfect.. just all of it.  Kristen, you came to the table saying, “how can I help?” and your partnership was invaluable.  You brought so many things to life that delivered true impact.  Eileen, you truly define what “true leadership” means.  You have been so supportive, walking alongside me, moving obstacles, having my back and beyond through this journey.  You believed in me at times in which I most certainly wavered through this process - incredible!\n\n212#Customers Belong at WHLive!|Dear Dream Team,   I am thankful for the opportunity to have worked with each of you this past quarter. All of you provided great insight into the Workhuman Live conference culture, shared past experiences, and areas we (Customer Success) could use to level set on our approach to pitching Workhuman Live to customers. Patrick, you shot it out the park with the WHLive Elevator Pitch Builder. This great exercise will help verbalize our thoughts regarding the importance of this conference. With that said, Tim, you absolutely captured the audience with your honesty and brought the facts to back up why Customers no matter the level or location should join in the WH movement. Judith, you are right! There is no wrong time to introduce WHLive and we should use our excitement from past conferences fuel customers to register. Dan, you took the time to review all the PowerPoints, documents, created a presentation timeline, lead meetings, and kept us on our toes. Furthermore, you didn’t mind answering my million questions on the presentation deck.   Jill and Jeff, thank you for creating the WHLive playbook deck. This resource which includes customer testimonials will truly help us with recruitment.   Couldn’t leave out our leaders, Danielle and Liz. You both prioritized our team meetings, listened to us gather our thoughts, and boldly asked us to reconsider our approaches for a centralized recruitment method. Without your guidance, this wouldn’t have been possible.   What I learned from working with this team is that we truly live and are fueled by the Workhuman experience with the common goal of inspiring other companies to reconsider the future of work. Excited to hear all the Moments that Matter at this years WHLive!   Sincerely, Kel\n\n213#Feeling connected|Pam and Jill - I wanted to say thank you for the warm welcome you've both provided to me as I made the move into the Customer Marketing team this quarter. Not only do I feel a personal connection strengthening between us, I feel our work is becoming more and more connected which is exactly part of our vision! You've both been proactively bringing me into various discussions and meetings and totally receptive to my ideas. As you know, Eric B and I often joked that we were often forgotten in our previous Product Marketing roles. There was some truth behind the joking. We had each other but I never truly felt like part of a team and now, I do - thanks in large part to you both! I hope you agree that we are getting into a good groove and are happy about the progress we're making on our strategic marketing plan. I am very excited to partner with you and the rest of our group to bring the plan to life and accomplish amazing things together this year. Go Team!!\n\n214#Best First 30 Days Ever!|Team - I was reflecting on how much we've accomplished during our first month together. I selected Urgency for this note because it best reflects what all of you have demonstrated - ie., the asap tackling of tough challenges with a sense of Shoshin (初心) a word from Zen Buddhism meaning \"beginner's mind.\" To me this means displaying an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. This truly captures the dynamic we've co-built and are accelerating progress in. A quick recap of five significant things we've accomplished together: 1.) Alignment with cross functional partners (SLT, CS/CX, and MLT); 2.) Re-organizing to achieve FY20 priorities and accelerate growth; 3.) Moving the needle toward stronger, crisper, more provocative marketing messages; 4.) As leaders, together, building a shared model of transparency, trust, and robust debate; and 5.) Leveling up to strategic joint business planning. In ways big and small you have made me feel welcome, informed, and more self-aware of how to build a successful team. Jill from our dine around and leadership on Demand 2.0, to Pam with your advice on language for positioning the re-org, to Jeff from your \"get it done and here's what I need from you clarity\" on all things WHL audience acquisition and shared love of sarcasm, to Z your willingness to be the glue between teams and dedicate source for Girl Scout cookies - I want to say thank you for all we've done together and a \"save\" a future thank you for all we will do together. Happy Friday to all - keep up the great human work - it matters. With gratitude, -C\n\n215#Shoutout to all my Saucy Aunts|Thank you all so much for bringing great energy, enthusiasm, and attention to the kickoff with Influitive! This was a true cross-functional effort with representation from CX, CS, Strategy and Consulting, Marketing, Sales Operations, and Design – an awesome demonstration of the power of collaboration. As we heard, even our Influitive consultant was impressed with how much involvement we had. You all brought unique perspectives on how we can engage with and deliver value to our customers through this community platform. I’m still riding the wave of excitement coming from our kickoff and am so excited to engage with each of you further in executing on the strategy we developed together. And not only were we productive, but we got to have some fun in there too ?. I’m so grateful to work alongside each and every one of you. Looking forward to the amazing things to come!\n\n216#People-First Leadership|Team - I wanted to recognize the effort that went into our recent Customer Marketing re-alignment. Driven by and reflective of your input and support we implemented changes that were perceived positively by the business, and by - putting people first and considering the human aspects involved in change - have been received positively as growth and on-strategy changes by the great humans that make up the Customer Marketing organization. I thought it was important to celebrate this moment, because change is often scary, especially for teams in flux - but your advice and guidance around putting people first (always) directly influenced a plan that was highly communicative, well-scheduled, and well-executed by all involved. We are well on our way to the modernization of our Customer Marketing function. Thank you for building strong relationships on this journey - I'm optimistic they will pay dividends throughout FY20 and beyond! With gratitude, -C\n\n217#Full Speed Ahead|#weworkhuman #shootthemoon #theinstitute  What a revitalizing day and a half! Thank you to this team of great big thinkers and risk takers for a deeply challenging few days of daring to reach for BIG ideas and creative paths to accomplish our mission.

Cheers to the Dream State! Special shouts to Becky, Traci, and Jill for helping nail down our process and making sure we paused to drink and eat!!!\n\n218#PUMPED!!! About Partnership ...|Jill, Pam - Thank you for your leadership on our Marketing Calendar Alignment workshop with SLT, CS, and CX Leaders today. This moment mattered today and will pay dividends continuously in FY20. I want to specifically recognize a thoughtful, well-prepared set of meeting materials and discussion guide. It generated a high level of engagement and participation from our partners, and created the basis for a strong go-forward platform for iterating, evolving, and delivering a dynamic Marketing plan that is on strategy, aligned with our sellers' and customers' needs, and explicitly linked to our business goals. It also reflected critical transparency and collaboration dynamics we are building cross-functionally. Thank you, well done, and excited about the momentum we have going. With gratitude, -C\n\n219#Feedback|Jill - Thank you so much for your feedback. These requests can be time consuming and challenging. I appreciate your thoughtful and candid feedback that I can action. I truly value our partnership and relationship!\n\n220#A Force Unlike Any Other!|A force.  There is no other way to describe Jill Crawford.  We had 30 people coming together for a hack-a-thon project, which I was running, and I suddenly could not be there.  ‘Life happened’ to me, but you were right there to ensure that I could focus on my family and put me at ease that you had things in control.  The day went off without a hitch – thanks to you.  And that’s just one example of Jill being Jill.  You have helped me with the teams program, customer proposals, media planning, strategizing, and execution.  Every day, I watch in awe at your ability to manage deliverables, give focus to the team, prioritize the dozens of initiatives we have, and so much more.  You give of yourself personally and professionally every day – continuously offering a helping hand, advice, or just simply listening.  Your a manager, teammate, leader, friend – and a true force behind us all.  I couldn’t do it without you!\n\n221#Project Bow Tie|Pam, Jill and Matt, I just wanted to call out the wonderful job you are doing with Project Bow Tie.  Reimagining our demand generation function is daunting.  But you managed Phase 1 so smoothly and we're starting to build some real momentum now.  Not only have you navigated through those ideal customer elements seamlessly, but you have kept all stakeholders well involved, informed and excited.  This type of innovation that brings together cross-functional teams and gets them all pulling in the same direction is a great example for how we will all have to act in the coming years to continue the company's growth and innovation.  We still have a long way to go but well done so far!\n\n222#Marketing Master and Elevate Champion|It is incredible you can balance so many things at once and were able to lead the entire Marketing department in total shares of LinkedIn content. Your hard work and effort is greatly appreciated!\n\n223#Wonder Woman and She Ra have competition!|Jill and Pam- Thank you so much for bringing us together today to share what you learned and walk us through an exercise that will enable us to be more successful as Marketers! Your willingness to share and maintain transparency makes you both GREAT leaders! I know I don’t speak for myself when I say “Thank You” for allowing us to be a part of something amazing! If She Ra and Wonder Woman ever joined force they’d have some serious competition!\n\n224#Expert Guides|Thank you for guiding our teams through a fantastic planning session yesterday.  It was engaging, collaborative and fun.  As a result, we were able to ideate and let our creative juices flow.  I was particularly impressed with your approach to the session.  You constantly had the big picture in mind and guided the team to many important discoveries.  Thank you for using this innovative approach and for rallying the team around shared priorities for 2020.\n\n225#Cheers to you!!|Pam and Jill - Just wanted to take a moment to TOAST!! to the two of you for an excellent, productive, and super well-run planning meeting yesterday afternoon. The entire team was extremely engaged and collaboration was off the chain. We put our heads together, we were respectful but critical of ourselves, and we came up with some truly innovative ideas that will shape our marketing plans for 2020. I am truly inspired by the teamwork you both showed in leading the meeting together as well. Thanks so much for an excellent afternoon! Looking forward to our top 3 priorities for the year!\n\n226#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n227#Thanks so much!|I want to thank all of you for taking time out of your busy schedules to meet with me and get to know one another.  I enjoyed sitting with to chat about your role within Demand Gen and also a little personal side too.  I'm looking forward to working with all of you!\n\n228#Accelerating into 2020|What a year of surprises! Thanks to each of you for bringing your insights, ideas, and energy to bear on our top 5 accounts. We've been meeting quarterly to review from every angle how we can from every perspective, impact the business. So many great ideas were uncovered and put into action immediately from these conversations. And each of us, learned something big about how with some focus, we could more directly impact big opportunities as an organization. Thank you for early and late meetings, for staying focused, and for caring so much about excellence! This has been an incredible 'test' of the WH network! Bravo!\n\n229#Q4 QBRs Rocked!|Thanks to every person on this team for bringing your best selves to Cleveland in the middle of a flurry of major projects, meetings, deliverables, and personal commitments. Each of you came together to share some incredible best practices, strategies that have moved the needles with our biggest opportunities, and some big plans for 2020. There is no better group of people to spend 2.5 days with talking about work. You bring a passion to the business that is only matched by Traci's passion for Cleveland! Thank you for your commitment to excellence! You ROCK!\n\n230#Co-creating Great CX is a Team Sport!|Dear Team, I am so grateful to be able to call upon this amazing group of people! You were each willing to invest an entire day to thinking through the customer lens as part of our journey mapping workshop.   To say that I am impressed with the progress we made is an understatement.  We now have 4 draft journey maps - current and dream state for two incredibly important customer types, the End User and Buyer! Thank you for your contribution, energy and excitement about what we are seeking to do and the impact this can have on our business goals!  As we shared, CX is owned by all humans at Workhuman and this team showed so much commitment to CX and excitement around the potential that exists that if this is an indicator of how the rest of the company will feel, it makes me even more excited about how fast we can move our CX from current state to intentional & differentiated!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  You guys ROCK!\n\n231#WH Live  - we hit our first milestone!!!!|Team,  I am so proud of, energized and inspired by each of you!  We have hit our first milestone!  Your creativity, dedication and action bias have been evident from day 1!   I truly look forward to taking this exceptional movement forward with this tremendously talented team. On behalf of everyone that will be lucky enough to enjoy WH Live, Thank You!\n\n232#Cyber Monday!|As I sit here looking back on the past 2 ½ days, I am in awe at what this team has just pulled off.  It's one thing to think about rolling out a massive multi-day / multi-touch / multi-channel campaign with weeks of planning … but we decided to do so much more.  In just these 2 ½ days, we have managed to launch housing to all audiences, which included segmented email deployments, multiple site updates, platform updates, rebuilding every confirmation email, design, social, and more!  Buy why leave it at that?  We also pushed out the Justify your Trip content.  Custom letters by audience, site updates, design changes, functionality tweaks.  And even took the time to redesign and rebuild Eric’s Keynote page.  On top of all this – Cyber Monday went out the door today.  I started doing the math on the executional elements we have for this one campaign, but ran out of fingers, toes, and strands of hair to count on.  We basically crammed week’s worth of work into just two days, like it was nothing.  But it was everything!  This was no small feat, and every one of you played a role in pulling it off (almost) seamlessly.  The results are not in (yet), but this could not wait because we have completely set ourselves up for success thanks to all of you.  I so appreciate your focused commitment to the success of Workhuman Live.\n\n233#Making the Time|Jill - I just wanted to thank you for being so diligent when it came to your Outlook calendar while Jenn and I are beginning to bring Summer 2020 interns on-site.  It may sometimes seem like there is not enough time in the world - our on your calendar - but you always keep it updated, and when it is not, promptly let the Recruiting Team know so that we can schedule accordingly! I speak for all of us when I say you are not only a partner to our team, but a champion! Thank you.\n\n234#Great experience!|Just wanted to thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to arrange time for me to get to observe and experience what you guys do on a daily basis. I was only in the Framingham office for a short period of time but I feel like I've obtained and learned a lot which is so beneficial to me. Your knowledge, talent and overall dedication to your work is extremely evident, thank you for the experience\n\n235#Thankful for people like you|Jill, thank you for being such an amazing human in planning an allergy slack group and table for our gluten/dairy/soy/nut free friends! You don't have these allergies yourself, yet you rallied the group together to collectively bring in items across he board so everyone could be included. This is the definition of respect for all...you're the best!\n\n236#Team creativity|Thank you for your help collecting and sharing insightful, relevant information for our Q4 customer acceleration meetings.  With your contributions, we were able to identify marketing opportunities and generate new ideas for delivering value to these important accounts.  Looking forward to continued collaboration and the wealth of innovative ideas that will result!\n\n237#Thank you for the bottom of my gluten free heart..|Jill, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate you organizing the allergy table at the wonderful Thanksgiving event today.  I am gluten free and when I saw the table it made me so happy...and relieved!  It can be a little stressful trying to determine what is safe to eat in these types of situations.  The table made things worry free for me.  All of the options were delicious.  This was extremely considerate of you.  Thank you again!!\n\n238#Vacation Coverage|Thank you both for covering for me while I was on holiday this past week with my family :) Jeff - You not only made sure I felt comfortable with everything before I left and recapped what I missed as soon as I returned but, you also really stepped in and covered my day-to-day without blinking an eye. You were sending 3rd party materials to our agency partners, launching Dan Heath web, email social etc., updating the Wiki so our internal teams had everything they needed, and kicked off multiple projects in such a short period of time. Do you even really need me here, or should I just go back to Florida? It's too cold here anyways ;)  Jill - Thank you so much for stepping and writing a great brief to get the 'Justify Your Trip' project into the queue. Ensuring we have this valuable asset available to our prospective attendees prior to launching the Cyber Monday promotion will be critical. It's surely to pay off in the long run!  I am so happy to be able to work with and learn from the both of you... But, the fact that I can also count on you to roll up your sleeves and help out when it is needed, now THAT is just the definition of a great team!! Count me #blessed and super #grateful. Thanks again to you both for allowing me enjoy moments like the one pictured above without fretting about what was happening in the office. xoxo #bestteamever\n\n239#Amazing WHLive Update!!!|Team, I was so proud and happy that today we got the opportunity to showcase the tremendous work, planning and thoughtfulness that has been happening behind the scenes on WHLive.  Each of you brought your ‘A’ game and collectively we were able to demonstrate the commitment to bringing this movement forward and harnessing its’ strength for the company!  I am so inspired by each of you every day!  Thank you!!!\n\n240#There's no \"I\" in this team|I am so proud to be a member of this team, everyone was so selfless during my paternity leave. I received so many nice texts to check in on my family and ensure that all of my projects stayed on track. The support didn't stop there, from travelling to Washington to help with TOWL and the West QBR, to shipping out crates, preparing for future events, and sending out communications. Pam, Amanda, Krista and Jill, thank you again for everything that you have done. I truly appreciate it, best team ever!!\n\n241#Quality personality!|Jill, You show up at the crack of dawn, are always running from meeting to meeting, but somehow  maintain a great attitude. Thank you for running some inspiring meetings this week for great work to be done In Q4. You’re continuously enhancing the way we work and what we’re marketing to the world. Your presence at work makes us all better humans because of the qualities you bring to the table, such as; Hard Working. Collaborative. Passionate. Sensible. Practical. Communicative. Funny. Caring. Knowledgeable. Charismatic. Responsible. Considerate. Diligent. Witty. Realistic. Honest. Grateful. Human.\n\n242#Teamwork makes the dream work|Jill and Diane, As our operations team has grown, both of you have demonstrated great communication and collaboration with our team to execute on programs effectively. Communication is the key to success, and both of you make it very easy for our team to be successful. Thanks for being supportive during this process, and we look forward to making big things happen with you guys in the months to come. Keep up the amazing work!\n\n243#Modernizing demand gen|Jill, Pam, and Matt - I wanted to commend all of your work, passion, and focus around modernizing our demand gen strategy and approach. The three of you have worked diligently over the past couple of months building out the strategy and the how we do it at Workhuman. The meeting with Chris was a great one and it's exactly the type of partnership and future-oriented discussion needed. The marketing world has changed. We have an enormous opportunity to modernize our approach to move from an inquiry model to one that not only targets the right future customers but also drives new demand (and wins at a higher rates due to it being the right opportunity with the right level of investment).  Your efforts make it quite clear how much each of you care about our business opportunity ahead and continuing to elevate how marketing can partner with sales. Thank you!\n\n244#Customer Social Surround Presentation|Kristen - Great job presenting at Monday's management meeting. You were confident, poised, and well-prepared. You have done a remarkable job partnering with the SCD team to further their efforts - and your care and passion was quite evident. Socially surrounding customers is a huge opportunity for the business and your early learnings will help us in many ways as we scale our marketing function.  And Jill - thank you for your leadership and support along the way. You're always mindful of the larger business opportunity and empowering your team to deliver on the key strategic initiatives.\n\n245#Creating Unparalleled Relationships and Impact|A huge shout out to this team for creating human connections with our customers and delivering excellence beyond compare.  When Takeda asked us to connect them with another customer in the Pharma industry that would have had experience with both Madison and Workhuman, we immediately thought of Merck. We knew that Madison had been the other finalist when Merck was making a decision on who would be their partner for their global recognition program. Merck team, due to the incredible relationship you all have built, we had a great advocate in Dave Watson! Jay, you reached out and aligned with Dave immediately to have a critical conversation with Takeda. Dave did an EXCELLENT job of talking to why they chose Workhuman and quickly identified the missing link for Takeda.  It was pure gold to have Dave talk to James about “Workhuman is the Cadillac and Madison is the Pinto…Madison can’t support you on a Global scale”.  This kind of endorsement, partnership and willingness to jump on a call at a moment’s notice doesn’t just happen.  Kudos to the Merck team who set the stage for this amazing relationship from moment one.  From a Takeda perspective, Tim, the work you do on a daily basis has truly built an incredible relationship on this side too. Takeda trusts you and values what the you and the team bring each day to make this program so successful.  Jill, the work you have been doing over the past couple of months to build up the social surrounding communications and bringing a microsite to life has been impeccable. These resources will bring Workhuman into the forefront for those that may not know us while delivering “why Workhuman” in an impactful way.  Greg, the quick work you have done to build out the impact that the Celebrate program is have is just the differentiator we need. Amazing humans, THANK YOU all for your unwavering support, swift action and blood sweat and tears you have put into these relationships.\n\n246#Truly Imagination at Work!|Let me start by saying how grateful I am for this entire team for the collaborative efforts that you all put forth to design & deliver the gorgeous GE demo prototype to 25+ leaders at GE this week.  The feedback that I got from GE was \"the custom demo really made the difference\" and from a senior healthcare leader, \"really interesting & exciting...how do we get started!!\"  That is amazing feedback!  Special thanks to the marketing team for all of your hard work and creativity put into the custom demo AND the custom micro-sites that we are building together. To Dan Fiore who we refused to allow to enjoy his vacation :), to Sarah Whitman for attending and presenting at the meeting even though we only gave you 5 min to speak!  And of course to my relentless team, Traci, Kara, and Meghan...you are simply amazing at what you do. One more hurdle at GE behind us. We are getting there, team!!\n\n247#Always a team player!|Jill, it doesn't sound like a crazy wild time-consuming thing to do but swapping around your scheduling so that I could snag a room was a life saver. We have no space to go but important meetings to have and when I could find no other solution you fixed my problem. I appreciate you being so responsive and flexible. You are always a team player. Apologies for the inconvenience but huge thanks!\n\n248#6 Major Rockstars|A huge thank you to this team for pulling together an engaging and informative webinar on the 6 major risks of homegrown recognition. Lynne, Sarah & Lisa - thanks for being involved at the beginning, as we brainstormed the topic and how it could align to the other content in this campaign. Lynne - I really appreciated your insight along the way. Thank you for being a sounding board throughout the process. Jill - Thanks for managing so many \"bits,\" keeping everyone informed throughout the process, setting us up for success and using your radio voice to kick us off on the right note. Lauren - Thanks for being such a great partner throughout this process. You brought so much valuable experience and many personal stories that brought this content to life. And you worked beautifully with our 6th rockstar, Madeline, to deliver a fantastic webinar. Thank you!\n\n249#For being a human|Jill - recently I reached out to you for some coaching advice. You are booked solid all days, but you found time to call me.  It was not about a project, or a task. You are amazing and I appreciate your help, but please don't quit your day job to be a coach (because we need you to lead the demand gen way!). Thank you for your time and supportive words.\n\n250#Intuitive People Manager|Jill, I’m grateful for your decision to bring me aboard the demand gen team.  I appreciate the time you take to explain the big picture and your continued patience with my never-ending questions.  You have a keen ability to manage and to balance ramp-up time with a flow of added responsibilities.  You are accessible (even on your heaviest of meetingpalooza days) to provide answers and the support needed to keep the demand gen engine humming.  I’m excited to learn more and truly feel like I’m bringing my best self to work as part of your team.  Thank you, Jill!\n\n251#Q3 Acceleration|Thanks to this team for another outstanding Acceleration Project quarterly mind meld. Every quarter we come together representing the expertise and perspective of many areas of the business. This quarter was special as we've 'accelerated' our thinking and really got the team thinking bigger and making connections and recommendations. This commitment and intense work for our top 5 customers is paying off as we have come away with a laundry list of opportunities and ideas to grow and protect the business. Thank you for your teamwork, intense listening skills, and outstanding impactful insights!!!\n\n252#Marketing Leadership|Jill – this award is long overdue, but I have to point out the leadership you have brought to the marketing team since your first day. You instilled a demand gen discipline that has helped keep our campaigns on track, demonstrating measurable results. You have taken on customer marketing – not an easy role – and given the SCDs confidence in our ability to partner on high-level deliverables. You lead your team with passion and precision, while fostering alignment and partnership with key stakeholders throughout the company. You established improved communication with sales, and continue to represent the “goodness” that the marketing team is bringing to the business. You challenge the status quo, ask great questions, and follow up on both high-level promises (inquiry goals) and granular deliverables (stepping in to provide operational support for webinars). You have done this through myriad changes within the team, providing assurance and stability for those who may not be used to change. You are also an amazing, friendly human – bringing your whole self to work (cars, dogs, beer, and hair metal) and living our values every day. Thank you for your leadership and commitment to Workhuman.\n\n253#Speaking of gratitude...|I'm grateful for you! Jill, thank you so much for ensuring everything ran smoothly during our second-go at the Gratitude webinar. When you came back from vacation, you connected with me immediately to ensure all of our bases were covered. You worked with IT to get the technology squared away (not something you want to worry about on live day), connected with the Haymarket team running the webinar, scheduled a space for our speakers, and made sure you were there to answer questions, get everything up and running, and review/vet audience questions. These details are huge - they put our speakers at ease, so they can focus on delivering an engaging session. You put my mind at ease while I was away on vacation. I really appreciate your teamwork and your commitment to delivering a positive webinar experience for everyone involved. Thank you!\n\n254#A sweet first day back|Thank you guys so much for keeping me abreast of all the happenings around here while I was out on maternity leave, and for a super sweet first day back in the office. Coming in today to donuts, Night Shift, and pretty flowers on my desk put a huge smile on my face and I really can’t say enough about how much it meant to get a surprise like that on my first day back. Jeff  - I am already so impressed with the great work you are doing and am looking forward to digging into it all with you! Thanks again for a great first day and your help with the transition!\n\n255#Bottling the Experience!|As a parent, I have heard (and used) the phrase “It takes a village.”  I believe that same idea applies to many of the business challenges we encounter.  Being asked to develop a marketing approach to Bottle Workhuman Live – I knew right away it would take a village.  And WOW – did you all step up.  Taking three hours out of your afternoon to participate in our first ever ‘Bottle Workhuman Live Hack-a-Thon’ was a big ask in the midst of so many competing priorities.  Yet, every one of you jumped at the change.  You even took the time to do some homework in advance and help formulate the direction of the workshop.  You changed schedules to be there.  You came focused and ready.  You gave it your all!  I now have a 20 page deck of ideas to leverage – to create some fun, exciting, bold and disruptive marketing from.  All thanks to you.  I have a deep appreciation for every one of you.  Thank you!\n\n256#Leading from the Front|Jill - over the past several weeks, there have been many new ideas, approaches, and discussions related to marketing and our priorities. Through it all, you stepped up to help in so many ways - whether it's guiding a new team member, taking an active role in key program elements, or being fully engaged in improving how we work as a team. There is little doubt how much you have on your plate. Yet, you continue to be that partner to many inside marketing and outside as you know the business opportunity (particularly in sales) is massive this quarter.  I have seen your positivity and commitment to the future ahead many times over.  Well done and thank you for your leadership!\n\n257#Flexible as Gumby...|Big thanks to all of you for your quick replies today, and your willingness to flex your schedules to accommodate an interview next week. Trying to book any interview is no easy feat, but especially when multiple calendars look really packed. You all replied to my call for help in a flash, and gave me the flexibility I needed to be able to get a schedule in place. Thank you so much for your commitment to recruiting efforts, and to adjusting to the currently market conditions. I appreciate you!\n\n258#Marketing brilliance!|Jill & Kristen, thank you for partnering with the SCD team on multiple projects to influence the thinking of our most strategic customers.  You've devoted a ton of your time to listen attentively to the messaging that we are trying to convey and turned those ideas into amazing deliverables, campaigns etc.  With your help, we are moving the needle to effectively \"reach the masses\" to re-shape the thinking of some of the most influential HR leaders in the business.  Your amazing work will undoubtedly contribute to our efforts to build credibility, foster relationships, recruit to the cause, and ultimately increase their investment.  You are GAME CHANGERS!!!\n\n259#Boot Camp Presentations|Thanks to all of you for your preparation and execution at this year's Boot Camp.  It can be a bit intimidating to present to over 100 people, but you all stepped up to participate when asked.  In addition, I appreciate your willingness to participate in content reviews and dry runs in preparation for the event.  The team benefited from your willingness to share your knowledge and expertise.\n\n260#The Percussion Section is on FIRE|Thanks to each of you for bringing your 'best beats' to Bootcamp! Every great band needs a percussion section that can offer confidence, a solid framework, and some sick solos. Each of you came to play in Newport! Thank you for sharing your success with our most significant customers, your confidence in our market leadership, and your learnings along the way. Not only did you share with the broader sales organization but also in our team meetings throughout the week.  It's always tough to get through our QBR session, even when we have twice the time, so this time was especially impactful as you shared your work and opportunities. Especially thankful for our teammates who are bringing the pain with some incredible marketing ideas and experience projects that should elevate our ability to play into our Mick Jagger years! Cheers!\n\n261#Finance Flow|Oh, hey Buddy, Global Programs Goddess, Co-Presenter Extraordinaire, and Sales Bootcamp Roadtrip Companion! Just wanted to say what a pleasure it was to present with you at bootcamp this year. When I approached you with the idea of co-presenting, you didn't hesitate and just went with the flow. You are always a joy to collaborate with and I couldn't think of a better person to share the stage with when it comes to talking about how we're going to leverage the Finance persona work to reach this critically important audience. I really appreciate so much that you and your team see the true value and potential behind the personas project. I'm excited to continue partnering with you and excited to see what we learn with all these upcoming tests. Thank you for being an amazing colleague on all fronts. #financeforthewin\n\n262#The Best Demand Gen Partners!|Matt and Jill, The last few months, we've spent a lot of time together talking about how to modernize demand generation at Workhuman, and developing a new, best-in-class framework that will drive growth for our business. These conversations have been simply awesome for so many reasons but mostly because of our partnership. We listen to each other, challenge each other, respect each other, and make each other laugh :); and the result is a smart, strategic proposal that we are proud of and excited about.  I love that we leave these meetings fired up and always say how much we love these discussions! I know this is early days of the journey, and I'm grateful to be working with you from start to finish on this. Thank you for being the best demand gen partners!\n\n263#One more thing to cover...|Jill - Thanks for covering for me while I was on PTO last week.  You were already balancing multiple important priorities, but proactively reached out and suggested that I use you as my out of office coverage.  I appreciate you acting as both player and coach.  Thank you!\n\n264#The Start of Something New|Jill!!!  I cannot yell this loudly enough - partnering with you was so much fun!  When we first kicked-off Marketing Programs Specialist, I embarrassingly admitted that I had no clue what your team did.  1 - thank you for not laughing at me 2 - thank you for teaching me in the kindest and most thoughtful way!  You painted a picture of exactly what your team needed, and the search was on.  From headhunting, sourcing, and an internal candidate approach - you were there with me every step of the way.  The way you care for your team and your function was so inspiring to me.  You want the best of the best, and you make it happen.  Thank you for your transparency and honesty though the process.  Thank you prioritizing your time, quick communication times, and trust in me.  This was a successful search full of learning along the way.  I really hope we get to partner together again in the near future!  Thanks for making this such a fun and successful experience!\n\n265#Agenda at a Glance|Or, agenda in a moment.  Thanks all for coming up with a great overview of the important projects happening in Marketing, with just a little notice.  It was not only great to hear about the wonderful work happening in Marketing, but to see you all present it all so beautifully.  I am grateful for the talented team of colleagues we have at the helm and in support of all of these initiatives.  Thank you!\n\n266#What a Brainstorm|There’s nothing like a three-hour meeting, sandwiched between the company meeting, a marketing vp meeting, and countless other commitments.  Yet, every one of you came with your A-Game – ready to brainstorm a whole new approach to the Workhuman Live website experience.  Thank you all for showing up focused, open-minded, and collectively in alignment on exceeding our audiences’ expectations through the site.  Reimagining a website is never easy, especially when trying to set aside what we already know to try new things.  Every one of you stepped up to share your areas of expertise and add value into the overall plan.  Your input was so valuable and is helping to frame out an exceptional site plan for 2020.\n\n267#Leading from the Front!|Six weeks in, and I feel like I’m family!  Jill, you have made my onboarding experience simply amazing.  From day 1, you have integrated me into everything happening.  You’ve be patient in listening to my many questions, shared your insights, and been available whenever I have needed some of your time (which we all know can be quite difficult to come by). The onboarding plan you prepared was so comprehensive – it connected me with the right people and simply set me up for success. You lead by example every day, and I am appreciative of you taking the time to help me start off on the right track.\n\n268#In it together|I'm grateful that I get to partner with such a rockstar webinar team. Whether it's brainstorming an upcoming topic/speaker, pulling together an abstract, figuring out the right timing, getting on calendars, iterating on content, or executing in dry-runs and live events - I can count on you to have all of the bases covered and to be true partners in the process. I have a lot of trust in this team, and genuinely enjoy working each of you. Thanks for being \"in it together\" time and again. Go team!\n\n269#She does it again|When everyone else goes quiet, here comes Jill swooping in to help projects get back on their feet and out the door just in time. You are the demand queen! We wouldn’t have things steadily pumping out into the world if it weren’t for all of your heroic efforts! This week you tackled demand for Eric’s keynote project and SHRM which turned out to be a beast with so many people’s involvement. Thank you for taking the reins and driving it forward. Although I know this is not ideal, I want to make sure you are recognized because I know these are only 2 of your 57 other projects in motion.\n\n"
"270#Let's talk data!|Thank you all for participating in this morning's data think tank (especially on a Friday before the long weekend!). This was an important first step in working collaboratively to unlock the power of the data each of us collect with our teams across Marketing. I was truly inspired by all of your ideas and perspectives, and there is so much potential for us to use these analytics to take the right actions to bring everything we do for Workhuman to the next level!\n\n271#I'm only human|Jill, I have been thinking so much about our very fortuitous pairing at the Marketing offsite, and I  have to tell you, you really blew me away. As I am continuing to improve my personal brand and perception within the Marketing org, your kind, supportive and unsolicited words truly took me by surprise. I really appreciate your insight and value your thoughts as I think you have incredible work values and a great leadership sense. I can certainly learn a lot from you, and as you said, I believe we really have more in common than we think. Thanks for recognizing that I am only human, and supporting me when you didn't even know how much I needed it. I'd love to spend more time with you and think we can do great things together.\n\n272#Thank you for the support|These days we are so busy.  Our time is so valuable.  You spent 30 minutes with this new guy.  Listening to questions you probably heard 100 times over and answered with grace and clarity.  Thank you for teaching me how valuable teamwork is here at Workhuman and making this a welcoming environment.   I know from past experiences this is not the norm!  Thank you and I can't wait to take up more of your time in the future.\n\n273#Conference room shuffle|Many thanks to you both for the quick shuffle of conference rooms so I could secure a few for full-day sessions in June. I really appreciate how accommodating you were and how quickly you made the shift. Thank you!\n\n274#We do what...|Team, I cannot thank you enough for spending half a day to help Customer Success document the current state of our process from future Customer (prospect) all the way through ongoing management of a customer. Without each of your help, insights and expertise we would not have been able to visualize the work that is being done today on a 10’ by 6’ flow chart. As you know, this is a critical step to ensure we do not break up or downstream processes across various organizations as we reimagined how work is done in Customer Success in the future. I think we all learned so much about each other and the functions we support. Thank you again for your time, attention to detail and helping set us on a course to drive more efficient and effective systems and processes for all to take advantage of in the future. Great work Team!!!!\n\n275#Minimally Viable Presentation|MVP TEAM! WOW! What an amazing feat pulling together one of the best narratives we ever had presented at the ELT meeting today! The information flowed, they were wowed, they laughed, it showed our strengths and highlighted our successes. You ALL were integral to making this come to life, especially during the last minute crunch hours (YAY BRUINS!!!) I was so honored to re-pre-sent all that Marketing has been working on what's to come. You are a fantastic group of humans, so grateful to work with you.\n\n276#All about logos.|Jill and Lynne- thank you SO much for leading the Marketing station at our annual Bring Your Kids to Work Day! You both brainstormed some great ideas, choosing logo design as the topic. Kids ages 8-11 (the really quiet group :) ) were invited to talk about logos, why they are important, and design their very own logo! You showed some great innovation here - coming up with an engaging and educational activity! I appreciate you!\n\n277#Call for Speakers - Emails|Jill and Laura, thank you for helping to project manage the call for speakers emails. You stepped up right away to help incorporate these emails into the larger campaign and post-event plan. From before Workhuman until now you've kept me in the loop, reminded me of upcoming deadlines, and have been a second set of eyes before each one goes out the door. Most importantly, you've both been a pleasure to collaborate with along the way.\n\n278#No more inquiries about inquiries|Thanks for leading a fantastic Lunch & Learn session for the marketing team.  Your presentation was engaging, well thought-out and very informative.  And, your conversational style made it easy to ask questions and get involved.   It's sessions like this - open, transparent, and clear -  that will help us work as one, cohesive unit rather than in small, disparate groups.   Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedules to put this together.\n\n279#Because you care|Today you refused to go to a kickoff. Not because you wanted to be a jerk, but because the brief lacked the detail it should have had and you care. What I want to recognize you for is the way you handled it. You offered your precious time to sit with the project owner to make sure she understood how to fill out a brief properly. You know going into that meeting today, not having that valuable information would have been a big miss and caused more meetings or for people to leave that meeting unsure if what they needed to do. We all need to support one another and get this Marketing team up and running smoothly. You are the best brief writer so that person should be thankful and will hopefully lean on you again in the future if she needs to, but I think you just taught someone a thing or two that will stick with them for a while. You just saved a lot of time and headache right there. I can’t wait to see her next brief. Thank you for getting others to do their best just as you do every single day!!!!\n\n280#Great partners for exploration!|Jill, Laura, Kristen - Sharing some gratitude with you all on your ongoing partnership. Jill, how you are able to manage the competing priorities and campaigns that have been put on your plate lately is OUTSTANDING. You are always looking for ways to up-level our work, and drive inquiry goals. As a team, you all approached me with some great ideas for emails and landing pages for Workhuman prospect/customer follow up. Thank you for being open to collaboration, and pushing to do something different. I'm really looking forward to learning how these perform, and working on a long-term approach as we go forward!\n\n281#Living our values|Appreciation and gratitude to both Kristen and Jill for pushing out an email send deadline which allowed me to participate fully in the Persona Training workshop.  We live and breathe our deadlines in marketing ops no matter what else is going on around us.  The decision to push out one deadline made a huge difference, allowing me to be fully present in valuable training today.  Thank you!\n\n282#Persona Workshop Warriors Unite!|I have such a grateful heart for this day, this entire team of Marketing mavens, and all the opportunities that sit within our reach. I have never felt more connected to our team than I do at this very moment. We just completed an all hands, all day persona workshop! Woohoo!!! Thank you for your investment. Thank you for being a kind audience that stayed engaged. Thank you for asking thoughtful questions. Thank you for your humor and your patience. Thank you for being real. Thank you for embracing the 7 1/2 hour marathon persona training session we shared today with gusto and heart! I truly believe that we will be a better team, and we will produce better marketing because of the time we spent together today. I can’t wait to hear your feedback about the agenda, the learning modules, the wiki….ALL the things! I can’t wait to apply this first body of persona work to our marketing efforts. Let’s GOOOOOOO!\n\n283#Excellent Exec Readout - WH Live 2019|Hey team, I am so grateful for your professionalism and expertise, so clearly demonstrated in today's WH Live readout to the Exec Team. In many cases, team members dove deep, and you had all the answers because YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF. BAM! Well done, you made me proud!\n\n284#Barn & Noble Rock stars!|To the bookstore team...Thank you! I can't begin to describe how awesome this year's team was at Workhuman. Anthony, Jess and Mike, your ability to help anyone that needed it along with managing daily email sends and data clean up was awesome. Janet, Colleen, Maggie, and Manan...the best, most reliable back up crew a team could ask for! You never missed a call for support or a shift to help, from supporting customers, to learning Square, right down to stocking shelves, you made it possible for us to take breaks to see sessions, eat lunch, or manage the book signings. And then my steady crew - Liz, Maureen, Stephen, Wendy, John, and Jill, and Sara - these were long days on our feet, moving heavy books, and keeping customers happy. We were able to breakdown and pack up in record time thanks to you as well. You were all a joy to work with! Thank you all for the support and I hope you enjoyed Workhuman!\n\n285#Post event survey support|Thank you team for being a clear set of eyes on the last day to proof read and update the final attendee survey. We wanted to ensure our survey went out while the event was still fresh and clear in people's minds. Even though you were all busy, you made time on your schedules to give the survey one last clean review to ensure we caught all the important details. I appreciate your willingness to jump in and support the team and help us produce quality work!\n\n286#You guys rock!|Thank you all for being such amazing team members to our marketing team. We appreciate all you do from campaign planning, communication, collaboration, (oxford comma) and execution. Our operations team is only as strong as the team members we have working with us and you guys go above and beyond with each campaign. Thank you all for your attention to detail and working with Mike and Diane through the busy months of Workhuman and Demand Gen activities. We love working with you guys and value how hard each of you work to execute campaigns with a purpose. We all share laughs, tears, and excitement for every project. (JK on the tears) (Sometimes) (JK again!). I look forward to our future programs this summer! Keep up the great work y'all!\n\n287#Hitting the Workhuman numbers!|Jill, well done in exceeding our revised Workhuman audience numbers. I know the team worked incredibly hard, and we have lots to learn from this year - thank you for bringing it home and getting us over the line. No matter what, our growth YOY is impressive, and it would not have happened without your leadership. Thank you!\n\n288#Lead the Way!|Woah, that was fast! From conception to roll out it was less than 2 weeks to get the new lead retrieval solution out the door. Each of you provided such valuable insight and feedback. I can't wait to see the data that comes in!\n\n289#There's life after Nashville?|Dan, Jill, and Laura - While everyone is heads down preparing for Nashville, you are working hard on what looks like a kick-ass follow-up plan! Thank you for taking me (and  many others) through it over the last week to talk through 'all the things' - How does this impact Workhuman Cloud for Teams? How should sales and CS follow-up? What's the ABM strategy? Is the timing aggressive enough? Will this plan help progress opps?  It's shaping up beautifully with quite a few \"new and improved\" elements over previous years that will be exciting to test and see how attendees respond. Thank you for bringing a fresh, smart perspective to this important, time-sensitive initiative!\n\n290#Vitamin C|Is the juice worth the squeeze. You bet! This recognition is for getting every ounce of juice for Nashville. Working tirelessly to get every last message to every potential attendee - local, agenda, celebrities - you targeted all the profiles. Sharpening and re-sharpening the budget pencil to make sure every dollar spent is impactful. 110% mindful of the attendee experience. Not giving up on a reg system that is maybe not perfect to make sure it will be just right for all our needs - bootstrapping is real. Here's a final boost of vitamin C - cheers to you!\n\n291#WH19 Video Planning|Team - thank you so much for rallying with us to plan a concentrated attack on all things video capture in Nashville.  It's been A LOT to dig through: logistics, technical requirements, and post-event video strategy.  With all that effort in mind, now we can go to Nashville and support your goals.  Thanks for your patience, willingness to collaborate, and ability to ingest a lot of information (that is not relevant to you on a daily basis) to ensure we execute.\n\n292#Nobody quite like you|Jill- I had a English teacher and coach- let’s call him “Kedski”, he used to coach girls softball and basketball. We read Monte Python in class...enough said. He wanted his teams be warrior princesses...not to give up, help out when needed, give 110%...were you in his class? Granted this was decades ago(ugh how is that possible), but you had to have been there! I can’t imagine the last 2 days without your help!! You’ve stepped up, helped with emails, research, communications, clarification and everything in between! Warrior Princess may not be the right term, but damn girl you are a warrior!\n\n293#You Get It|I want to acknowledge this tremendous group for being the ultimate partners.  I work with you each on a regular basis and always think how lucky I am.  Plain and simple... you girls just get it.  You get how to work with Sales; you get what needs to be done; you get how to think outside the box; you get how to work with data; you get how to be a class act.  I want you to know how much I appreciate working with each of you.  Thanks for your partnership; it never goes unnoticed.\n\n294#Recruiting with Zeal|Thank you for your continued efforts and undying attention to all that is related to the marketing of the event. While results have taken a disappointing turn you have kept the \"pedal to the metal\" and never wavered from making sure we are trying everything.  I am grateful to have you at the helm, ensuring that everyone is doing their utmost to make us as successful as possible.\n\n295#Fast, Accurate, Inspiring Hands|For all of you lasered focused on all of the varied communications going out to our customers, THANK YOU! It's a race to Nashville and I am SO happy to have you all on our team! Lots of details and first impressions to be made and you are all making every effort to knock them out of the park.  YOU ROCK!\n\n296#WorkHuman Wonder Woman|Jill, I can't say enough about how great of a business partner you have been over the past few months. You are juggling WorkHuman, Globoforce, and who knows how many other projects, and you tackle them all with grace and a willingness to pivot at the drop of the hat. For WorkHuman specifically, you are always willing to sit with me and answer questions or shoot over a slack so that things can keep moving along as fast as possible, and if you don't know an answer, you are able to get it within minutes. I really appreciate how committed and involved you have been in trying to develop a program that is both successful and sustainable for the future. Thank you!!\n\n297#Navigating the Winding Road of WorkHuman|Jill - I am grateful for your awesome work leading our Workhuman acquisition efforts. The captain of the ship!  The drive to Workhuman is far from easy.  Many twists and turns.  Many things out of our hands but you’ve managed our collective efforts in a collaborative and respectful way. You always keep the key objectives in mind and always display a determination and passion to getting us toward our goal. You also make sure to lighten the mood when needed during tense meetings. This element is hugely important. We are all humans working toward a common goal and this level of empathy for your teammates goes a long way – and drives better performance and teamwork.  Thank you.\n\n298#demand 2.0|It's really hard to find the time (never mind the head space) to think beyond the many looming deadlines we are juggling, so I want to thank you both for an invigorating discussion and a great working session this morning to reimagine how we manage demand gen as we grow and evolve. I think it was probably 9 months ago we really began to identify ways we can up our game and work toward a best practices model for demand, and while we have made some progress for sure, it's time to dig in. I love seeing the commitment to excellence combined with a pragmatic approach to improving how we engage with the market and support pipeline acceleration. We are early in the process but this work will help set the company and our team up for the next level of success. Let's keep going!\n\n299#Agile Awesome|Awesome work in coming together to announce Lisa Borders on our social channel. Process is extremely important - but there are sometimes occasions where we need to be agile and quick to take advantage of an opportunity. Agile thinking can also be a great opportunity to test and learn.  Many times the best learnings come from the untried. I look forward to seeing how the stagger approach works to announcing a speaker for WorkHuman.\n\n300#You Rock!|Hi Jill, Just a little note of thank you for our monthly Marketing Programs/BDR meetings. You are always honest and real with us, listen to us with an open mind,  keep us posted and have great ideas to move things forward. I so appreciate you! ~Allison\n\n301#Speakers, Data, Codes.....GO!|Thank you for coming together over the past week to review numbers, offer insights, provide support and develop and roll out a communication plan in 2 days time around our WH speakers and registration goals. Your efforts are vital to our company wide messaging and the success of WorkHuman registrations over the next few weeks. Thanks for making this all come together for our company-wide announcement and action plan!\n\n302#100% effort, 100% to goal!|Congrats on achieving the 20,000 inquiry goal for 2018 — a valuable and engaged universe of campaign respondents that will drive future value for Globoforce! What's more, over the past year we've worked together to become both smarter and more efficient in how we plan, execute and measure demand campaigns. The advent of Core campaigns for Recognition and Performance means we have a consistent presence using less team resources, the digital component is more thoughtful and effective and we are tuning up and optimizing wherever we can. 2019 is sure to be another big step up; thank you for the great work!\n\n303#Stellar Survey Promotions|Thanks to this talented team for successfully promoting the Customer Satisfaction (NPS) Survey.  Without your engaging content, accurate dashboards and timely execution we couldn’t have received the number of responses that we did (especially during such a noisy time of year for our customers).   The more responses we get, the better we understand our customers and the better we can meet their needs. Thank you!\n\n304#The little engine that could|I am not sure where we would be without you, but thank you for jumping in to do another job besides your own, and helping to organize and manage campaigns and special efforts for the marketing of WorkHuman. Your enthusiasm, organization and imagination have been so instrumental in helping us to reach 1400 registrants - and I know will help us to reach the finish line. Thank you for your long hours and extra efforts for the team, and for keeping everyone and everything on track.\n\n305#Q4 2018 North America Social Media Champions|Congrats all of you on being the top sharers of our social media posts on Dynamic Signal for Q4! Your added boost to our content gets our thought leadership in front of more potential customers and employees. Thank you for your help!\n\n306#Just because...you're so amazing!|Jill, I've been meaning to give you this award for a while now. You've taken on so much of the WorkHuman load this year. You lead meetings with a purpose and have helped to streamline many lengthy processes. All of us notice your tremendous efforts and you've been a wonderful teammate to collaborate with on content and speaker highlights. This is a \"respect for all\" award because you always have respect for quality, urgency, and teamwork.\n\n307#You nailed it!|Jill, congratulations on the terrific job you did in this weeks' Exec meeting. You were calm, cool and collected,  even when delivering an important update on one of our biggest challenges - WH05 audience acquisition! I just love your wonderful combination of pleasant disposition, humour and high standards - it's been delightful to watch you take on more responsibilities and whip us all into shape. Keep on keeping on!\n\n308#Working Human, Working Smart = Big Results!|Hey team, I wanted to acknowledge the great progress you have all made in just a few short weeks. From getting more data to better understanding registration sources and drivers, to launching an incredibly successful Cyber Monday campaign, it feels like every week the team gets savvier, more disciplined and more effective. You are a living demonstration of the power of \"working smart\" vs. just \"working hard\". I can't wait to see even more insights and intelligence as we continue to learn and optimize!\n\n309#Journeymapping Stars!|A sincere thank you on behalf of the CX Team for participating in our first ever journeymapping aimed at the buyers experience. Each of you represented core areas of our business and stepped into the shoes of our customers to provide deep insights to create a picture in time of our current state. Journeymapping is an extensive project that requires many! Every single phase of the journey is critical to our business, from first awareness to contracting… from launch to even potential shut downs. Thank you so much for your passionate participation and honest candor. It's a pretty amazing thing that we have to remind folks to table brainstorming or solutions so that we can first nail down the current state. To me, this shows how eager our people are to learn from our past, dip into research and data, to push the boundaries on innovation and to challenge the status quo so that Globoforce can be way above the pack. These sessions and your input will propel us forward in every single corner of the business to be more aware and aligned with each other and with our customers. That is powerful - THANK YOU!\n\n310#At the helm!|It's the eve of THANKSgiving and you Jill are top of mind. I wanted to pause before the rush and send my appreciation for you and all you have done for the customer side of the house. It feels like you have been working for Globoforce for many years. The amount of things you have joined Alice and I on as it relates to customers and then impacted greatly is something others were not able to do in a much longer period of time. You have \"graceful grit\" and such a huge heart. I am so so very happy that we snagged you for Globoforce because you have been phenomenal to work with and have helped us to align projects and actions where they belong. I know the sky is the limit now because we have you at the helm. THANK YOU for being you and delivering A+ to our team and our customers. We have felt the impact in so many ways and this is just the beginning. :)\n\n311#Superwoman|Jill, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge just how amazing you are. You are managing so many things right now, are being pulled in so many directions, are advising on so many initiatives – I don’t know how you manage to keep it all straight! And what’s more, everything you touch seems to turn to gold. Your insights are invaluable and the impact you’ve had on our team, department and company are truly impressive. And what’s more, you’re extremely responsive, and always make time to check-in with me which I appreciate more than you know. Thanks for being a superwoman boss!\n\n312#We're getting better - since you've been ours!|Jill - Your hard work and dedication to understanding and revamping the WorkHuman audience acquisition team's approach to planning and execution has been paramount as of late. These past few weeks, as we inch closer and closer to the \"double down\" zone have been a whirlwind. Updates, pulling reports, analyzing promotions for the past 4 WorkHumans, rethinking existing campaigns, strategizing news ones, and optimizing.optimizing.optimizing. I KNOW it hasn't been easy. And I know that you are surprisingly still fairly new to all of this but, I can say, we're certainly getting better all the time thanks to your leadership. You've taken the time to get to know each team member's roles and responsibilities, workloads, strengths and weaknesses and you're using all that information (and more) to steer us towards our goals without burning out. And without forgetting your \"day job\" ;) Thank you for everything. Especially for still being able to make us laugh when we need it!\n\n313#Together we have achieved greatness!|Thank you all so much for your incredible partnership delivering the NPS customer close the loop communication. It was definitely a tough project at times as we navigated the options available to us in order to ensure the first piece was delivered correctly to maximize the impact on the customers. The content was obviously a key ingredient. We had to take a huge amount of very detailed content from across many departments and massage it into impactful, meaningful and valuable nuggets that the clients would value and would allow the customer to be inspired about how well we are listening to them and acting upon their feedback with the net result being their decision to participate in the next survey and rate us with a higher NPS score!  No small feat!  Yes, we learned a lot to bring to the next phase and throughout the journey you guys were the perfect partners – passionate, creative, patient and determined to deliver upon my vision!  Thank you!  Already we are at nearly at 50% open rate with almost as high click through without the awareness efforts from the CS team realized as yet!  Remarkable!  Thank you and I am excited to see the results grow over the next few weeks!\n\n314#Lucid dreaming|Jill and Holly - thank you SO much for all of your recent efforts around streamlining effective promotions for WorkHuman 2019. Your lucid chart is the stuff dreams are made of, and the two of you are already proving to be a dynamic team. I think these new tools will help us to think more strategically about WorkHuman promo going forward instead of constantly being in survival mode. Great work!!\n\n315#Commitment to Personas Project|Jill - thank you for all the time and energy you put into getting Darcy up to speed on our campaign framework this week. We all know how busy you are but you somehow managed to find what I am sure was multiple hours of work to pull together a TON of valuable content examples for our all our campaign as well as a solid overview of results. Yes AND all in a very short window of time so that we could sprint toward finishing the first draft for Phase 1. You also jumped on the phone with me for a good 90 minute discussion to explain everything to Darcy which was immensely helpful to her grasping our approach and vision going forward. Your commitment to the Personas project helps ensures what we deliver is useful and actionable and I am genuinely grateful for your partnership.\n\n316#Most flexible award goes to....|Jill - thank you SO much for filling in last minute on an interview earlier this week. I gave you less than 24 hours notice, but you jumped right in without blinking an eye and moved your schedule around to accommodate. I so appreciate how willing you are (always!) to lend a hand. You are such a great partner and I'm so glad we get to work together!\n\n317#WorkHuman Wonder Women|Ladies, I just want to acknowledge all the work you're doing to make sure the marketing/creative side of WH 2019 continues to run smoothly. It's not an easy job, but the three of you are managing it with efficiency, grace, thoughtfulness, creativity, and humor - as always. You rock!\n\n318#Marketing Leadership at Work!|Big Team - thank you for all the hard work and homework you put into preparing for the Marketing Offsite. It took weeks of prep, but we plowed through the entire organizational plan AND gave ourselves space for some extraordinarily creative and transformational thinking (who doesn't love THAT? ;-) Thank you for bringing your whole selves and giving your colleagues the gift of your undivided attention. Thank you for your leadership, candor and trust, and thank you for your DECADES AND DECADES of experience, put to work! :-)  As we all know, the real hard work starts now to get us to coherent and aligned 2019 plans, executing against those plans and tackling the big projects we identified. I am so proud to be a part of this team, and I meant what I said: I have NEVER worked with a more engaged group of people in my entire career. I am so excited about what we will accomplish together, and how we will contribute to accelerating Eric's thrilling vision for our company!\n\n319#Bringing out the Inner Peace!|Thank you for making the exercise of taping my very first video shoot a great experience!  You were so kind, sensitive and helpful in ensuring I felt comfortable and could do the best to deliver in the moment!  Thank you!  You are such pro's and you made it way more fun than I expected, even though doing it in the kitchen was super scary with all the activity and humans roaming around in there!  Great work and thank you!  PS - love the teleprompter! :-)\n\n320#Newsletter take 2!|Awesome work on the quarterly \"low touch\" customer newsletter. Thank you all for the different roles that you played, from helping with the verbiage, to the creative, to the sending, and to the overall vision and completion of this once again. I appreciate all of the help, and it wouldn't have come to be without all of you!\n\n321#Excellent September All Hands!|Team, thank you so much for your individual and collective efforts to deliver yet another technically flawless, engaging and informative Marketing All Hands. These times we get together to share our progress and connect with one another are so important to our strength as a team. Thank you for bringing your best selves and taking the time to communicate with your colleagues!\n\n322#Great Partners|Thank you each for sharing part of your busy week with the SCD team for our Q3/2019 ideation and planning sessions. Each of you make a huge impact on our work with customers every day and each of you truly understand what it means to partner. We’re so lucky to have partners who share our optimism, vision for growth, and impatience for all of the opportunities we want to close in on! Many thanks for sharing you time and talent in person (!) this week. Sincerely appreciated!\n\n323#Analyze This!|Jill – Since you’ve started at Globoforce, you’ve been a dynamo.  You’ve quickly become such a trusted and reliable leader on so many fronts.  I also wanted to highlight your work  with our industry analysts.  These are important people to us – relationships that have long-term significance. Collaborating with us and them on lead gen programs is incredibly useful toward showing Globoforce's commitment to them and leveraging our relationship on the sales side. Thank you for making programs happen with these folks (it began with Brandon Hall but upcoming plans are set too!).  It’s a pleasure working with you on these projects and strategies!\n\n324#Pivot to present in hours|Taking a minute to recognize my teammates on the Agency Workflow priority. Monday afternoon we had to pivot and rework our presentation with a tight deadline. This team jumped on Slack to sort out how to divide and conquer and put our best message together. I doubt anyone in the room felt it wasn't a presentation that had weeks of time against it. It was simple yet complete, and elicited solid feedback. Way to be responsive, team!\n\n325#Bringing your best game!|Pam, Jill and AMC, I know that a ton of prep went into getting ready for the 2H review earlier this week, and it showed. I am so glad we had the time to prepare and take a hard look at all the good work that has been done and (will be done) for the rest of the year. Your diligence has provided us with clarity, focus and a terrific foundation to build on for 2019 planning. Each of you made a massive contribution in the meeting itself, and you made me very, very proud. Such a strong team - I am so pleased to be a part of it. Well done!\n\n326#A core team helping rethink demand gen!|Laura and Jill, I want to recognize all the effort, energy and creative thinking you have you have put into demand gen planning this summer, creating a framework around different campaign types that will help us support a broader set of important business goals -- while also getting better at how the work gets done. I've so appreciated all the positive collaboration, exploration and evolution of ideas around always-on \"core campaigns\" that will allow us to have a more constant and consistent presence in the market. We're also testing new themes and personas, approaching customer marketing in a more cohesive way and getting a ton of stuff done. It's been a big push into labor day but so worth it as it sets us up for a strong end to the year! Thank you for the thoughtful commitment to pushing us forward, (always with a sense of humor!) -- look forward to building on this progress with the team!\n\n327#My Trojan horse!|Since you’ve started at Globoforce, I have loved our frank, hilarious and candid conversations. In the midst of our workflow process project, you and I couldn’t be more aligned than we are and YOU are the poster child (or Trojan horse) for how we can improve. With your help and leadership, we can be quite a powerhouse team and I am loving where we are headed. Together, we can make this a [globo]force to reckon with!\n\n328#Lost without you|Jill, I cannot thank you enough for all the guidance and support you provide to me, especially over the past few weeks! Things have been in a constant shifting pattern, forcing us to stop, backtrack, weave and pivot on the core campaigns, our messaging, our quarterly plans etc. It’s been challenging at times, but through it all you’ve been a voice of reason. I have so enjoyed our impromptu brainstorming sessions, and appreciate your open communication, your positivity, regular check-ins and delightful sense of humor. Thank you for helping to keep me sane!!!\n\n329#Great Second half Marketing Review!|Well done team on the second half Marketing review meeting and presentation. What a great meeting and what a great team! There was obviously a huge amount of work that went into the preparation for that presentation and it turned out fantastic. How energizing to see how over the next few quarters we are going to execute on great campaigns, yet keep building new tools and approaches to make us better and better. The future looks modern and agile, yet with a sense of urgency and speed. And we’re upping our game in all things data and attribution related. Great work, looking forward to seeing the fruits of all this work for many quarters to come. Thank you!\n\n330#recruiting partnership|Jill - thank you so much for taking time out of your busy week to sit down with me to review resume submittals for your open position. Your specific feedback on why you did and did not like the backgrounds we looked through was really helpful for me in my sourcing going forward. Partnerships like this are truly necessary for us to hire the best talent for Globoforce!\n\n331#In a league of your own!|Ladies – great collaboration this afternoon to level set on the Core Campaigns and discuss the best way to move forward with organizing them in Workfront. I know these past few weeks have been chaotic and Jill and I appreciate your patience as we sort everything out. We may not always hit a grand slam our first time up at bat, but we improve each time! Angela, a special thanks to you for getting everyone in the same room to discuss the pains and how to move forward. Coming out of the meeting, I feel really good about where we’re headed, and so fortunate to work with such positive and collaborative teammates! You really all are in a league of your own :)\n\n332#Plan & Team - Check!|Thank you guys for demonstrating your commitment to Customer Marketing!  You have assembled a great cast of characters to take on a variety of roles to focus and drive our customer marketing efforts!  The very first step was to create a workable plan with associated resources allocated!  Thank you for sharing the plan and team with us this week.  You clearly have been listening to all the feedback we have provided crafted a thoughtful first step!  Now that we have a plan and a team in place, the excitement can begin executing upon that plan.  I am looking forward to all that we can achieve together for the remainder of this year and 2019!  Thank you!\n\n333#Two steps back, one step forward|Ladies - I feel a bit spoiled for all the quality time I was able to spend with you last week! We still have a ways to go, but it was invigorating to partner with you two on the framework and messaging for our core recognition and performance marketing programs. What we thought would be a relatively quick and simple exercise turned into something bigger - much needed foundational work to synthesize all the new messaging we've rolled out this year with the launch of the new website and WHC, and boil it down into what we believe matters. Articulating in a clear and succinct manner why we exist, how we do it, and what we offer is exactly what needs to come through in the campaigns you are building! Every time I had another version to share with you, no matter how busy you were, you jumped in to suggest different ways of saying or structuring something. Your feedback was extremely useful and I'm excited to continue our collaboration. Thank you for being awesome teammates with great attitudes and ideas.\n\n334#5th dimension beyond that which is known to man...|... it is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity...  it's called TOP OF FUNNEL.  Tactics, types, segments, strategies, nurturing, goals, inquiries, conversions... as I was thinking of these words, admittedly the twilight zone spiral came to mind.  Demand Gen and top of funnel marketing is a world of it's own; a delicate partnership between Sales, Operations and ABM.  You four foxes have played a pivotal role in ensuring our programs are designed and executed flawlessly.  The dynamic and communication among this group is untouchable; and I'm so proud to roll with such an intelligent pack of women.  Hey!  ... that's the signpost up ahead - your next stop, OPPORTUNITY!   :)\n\n335#A focus on Conversations|While a number of important marketing initiatives have supported Conversations since launch, until recent weeks we haven't had the opportunity or the bandwidth to come together as a team with a cohesive plan to increase awareness, drive demand and better supports the sales and customer success teams. The plan we presented this week is a framework we can build on to better reach the market with a compelling message, and to communicate across marketing and with sales. The planning process got us moving and shines a light on where we need to focus. Thank you all for making the time to contribute with already very full schedules --  a special shout out to Eric B for shepherding the team to get this done!\n\n336#The heart of Globoforce|Jill and Laura, Can we please take a second to recognize all of your efforts to keep Globoforce pumping through everyone’s veins? We have a steady heartbeat of beautifully designed assets being worked on between multiple programs at a constant rate. The results you share keep our hearts full. The number of webinar registrants you pull in are amazing! Thank you for all of your planning, organization and updates as things move and change to ensure everyone stays on track. Your hearts are truly in it!\n\n337#Inspiring our Customers!|Thank you all for helping put together what was THE BEST customer webinar we've held to date!  It took a lot of herding cats, a lot of follow up, some technical skills, and a lot of creative editing and each of you pitched in with joyful hearts!  The UHG team knocked it out of the park and it could not have happened without all of you tee'ing them up for success!  Bravo!!!!!!!!\n\n338#the perfect pairing|You guys go together like peanut butter and chocolate–and you just make everything better! I wanted to give you both a shout out for all the work, the organizing and planning, putting up with me constantly poking everything with a stick, last minute edits and approvals–it's been a project to say the least! But you two have handled it with grace and determination. I feel like we're set up for success because of all the hard work you two have been doing and I know it's going to get us to a better place. I cannot wait to see how these new campaigns perform, but I know it's only the beginning and it will set the benchmark for all of us. Thank you for all the value that you add, your partnership and your patience!!!!\n\n339#Thanks for the chatter!|Jill- Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy day- before vacation no less to walk me through the marketing plan for conversations. Matt reached out to me and on the fly I created a plan that made no sense. After sitting with you I realized that there is a solid plan already in place. I was able to give you his T10/S25 to help with some digital and social targeting done by our third parties and will regroup with him to discuss a creative foot opening approach- possible some chatter teeth? (I hear Pam cringing lol) Thank you for helping a fellow teammate out!\n\n340#A commitment to getting it right|In typical Globoforce fashion the launch of the RAP campaign was a great team effort, but I want to call out your leadership of the project and the quality of the result. It is such a good step forward to see a coordinated effort with a series of related messages against different personas and a cohesive experience through the campaign journey. You've done a terrific job of communicating across the team -- and making sure the issues were well understood and that we kept on moving forward! Your responsiveness, focus and great sense of humor all made a big difference (and do every day)! Look forward to seeing the results in market and learning from the effort!\n\n341#Bootcamp Prep!|Hey team, thank you so much for all your time and effort in prepping me to speak to our demand gen/lead gen/social selling/campaign attribution efforts at last weeks' Sales Bootcamp. Feedback was very positive, and it's so great to see the ongoing tight relationship between Marketing and Sales. Looking forward to more great results in 2H and beyond!\n\n342#Carrier Pigeons|Thank you both for all your help in getting me the links I needed to send a prospect. She had lost the information and really wanted to be able to experience all the speakers again from WorkHuman and you made it happen. Thank you.\n\n343#Q2 Social Media sharing champions!|Joyce and Jill - Congrats on your 1st and 2nd place finish in the VoiceStorm social media sharing standings. You've both embraced our content and set a great example in amplifying it to your networks. Thanks and congrats!\n\n344#Ready for your close up!|In true Globoforce fashion, when I put the call out for photoshoot models, so many people jumped at the chance to help. A photoshoot like the one we held this week takes true teamwork and the work of many to be successful. I am truly appreciative for all of you who made time and were patient/flexible/available throughout the process. Thank you to those in scheduled shoots and for those I grabbed last minute who were willing to jump right in. The careers website is going to look AMAZING because of so many of you! We are going to have an incredible photo library of our incredible people doing incredible things. Thank you to all of you - I am truly grateful!\n\n345#Respect for Conversations Marketing|Team, you got it done! Thank you for your dedication to the Conversations marketing plan.  We had a tight deadline to from project start to check-in to executive review.  It was easy for each of you to deliver your information because you're so organized.  I appreciate your ability to turn around my requests quickly and provide the necessary detail to build the marketing team's Conversation marketing plan.  Thank you for your quick input and positive response to this project and for living our value of 'Respect for Urgency.'  Great job everyone.\n\n346#Employee Experience report ready in record time|Thank you so much for coming together as a team to get the Employee Experience Index ready in time for SHRM. Angela, you spent hours on the phone with Fedex to figure out the most efficient and cost-effective way to print it. Dianne, you quickly mobilized a team, set up kick-off meetings to get the project completed in time. Anthony, Matt and Diane, thank you for your expertise and finding a solution to create a vanity URL on Marketo landing page. Lisa, thanks for your input and for joining the call at such short notice. Alana, thanks for making the slides look pretty. So many slides and so little time. Truly appreciate all your help. Jill, what can I say about you? You are a pleasure to work with. On top of every project, every single time. Thanks, everyone.\n\n347#Campaign briefs team training|Thank you both for taking the time to lead the team through best practices on completing campaign and event briefs. It was great to talk through examples, discuss where there are challenges, and think about solutions to help streamline the process while also providing our colleagues with the information they need to create and launch programs. Your commitment to helping us all be better at this is much appreciated!\n\n348#Webinar Fire Drill|Thank you all so much for your help with the webinar fire drill on Friday! Jay, we could never have gotten the follow-up emails out if you hadn’t come to the rescue. Thank you for putting the breaks on everything so you could get the video up online. And thank you for all the troubleshooting! Diane, as always, you pulled out all the stops to get the thing done! You have the patience of a saint, and so much fortitude. Thanks to you we were able to get the webinar follow-up emails, and tasks assigned by EOD. And Jill, thank you for all your help with the reporting. It was a jumbled mess, and I’m so grateful for your help in sorting it all out. Nothing about this situation was ideal but everyone pulled together to make what could have been a much worse situation, so much better. Thank you all!\n\n349#Keeping it real!|Jill, just wanted to thank you for giving me some great feedback on a work-in-progress 'video / animation' project brief we've been working on. You've set aside time from your busy schedule to collaborate with our team on this, sitting down with me and emailing me your valuable opinions from a non-video perspective, and some really thoughtful suggestions along the way. User testing and refinement based on first impressions and open feedback is a major key to what we do every day, thanks for keeping it real and being so helpful!\n\n350#Teamwork makes the dreamwork|Thank you both for finding the time on such short notice, to record the extra 15 minutes of Q&A for our webinar replay with HR.com! I’m sure we’ll get MANY more registrations now that we meet the minimum time criteria for SHRM and HRCI credits. Jen, thank you for proposing to record the session – it was definitely the best solution! And you did a fabulous job handling all the questions that came your way. Each of your responses was well thought-out and enlightening. You are a wonderful speaker. Jill, if Good Morning America hears this segment, they may recruit you as a moderator. You’re commentary was the added cherry on top! Thank you both.\n\n351#Totally awesome Total Rewards teammate|Jill, I wanted to recognize you for your leadership and partnership related to our Total Rewards presence. It’s the end of Day 1 and our booth was hopping with engagement! I genuinely appreciate your strategic marketing expertise that shines bright with every project or campaign you lead. The presentation loop, the strategy around drawing attendees in to answer our survey questions and spin the wheel, the pre-show and post-show emails....your thoughtful approach to every single thing and thorough attention to the finer details is paying off. I enjoyed partnering with you on all things Total Rewards and look forward to working together on future projects!\n\n352#Weekend Warrior|Jill! Thank you so much for lending a hand on preparation of Total Rewards! You are the pro when it comes to pre-show marketing and messaging for the booth! I can't thank you enough for helping over the weekend and taking a look at PowerPoint to make sure we had everything covered! I look forward to next week and experiencing the tradeshow together! Thanks again for everything! You are a true asset to our team!\n\n353#a thousand little things|OMG you are SUCH a Globostar. We have a recurring meeting, and you just sent an agenda. On a Monday. And it made my morning. But this is such a you thing, taking care to make sure everything is organized, makes sense and it presented to the team in the way that feels most relevant. I think you are proof that great people make great coworkers. Your sense of empathy and thoughtfulness clearly drive the way you build your projects, your AMAZING briefs and your super productive meetings. You are ALL THE THINGS. Thank you so much for just being you!\n\n354#Demand Gen Geniuses|Jill and Laura, this is way overdue, but I just wanted to thank you for being such rockstars and so on top of your game with all things Demand Gen. From your absolutely gorgeous briefs and lucid charts to keeping on top of multiple campaigns and the zillion WorkHuman follow-up communications, you’re a dynamic duo to be reckoned with when jt comes to organization, planning, and thinking things through. I love working with both of you - not just because you’re super delightful peeps - but because I know that there will always be clarity of intent articulated in Jill’s eloquent way in the kick-off, that I will have more than enough context, and that two incredibly responsive people will be at the ready for questions. This makes my job that much easier. Thank you! You guys rock!\n\n355#The Beast That is WorkHuman Follow Up|Jill, you and I have been in the same boat trying to navigate our first WorkHuman. You've done a wonderful job communicating with all the people that are involved in the follow up process. When I came to you with a request to have session videos sent to all attendees by 4/30 you made the necessary adjustments. When it came to the meet & greets and whose photos we needed to send out you again adjusted when there were even more people and groups who received this benefit then you expected. I don't know how you get it all done but then again I also notice you're here at 7am everyday to make it happen. Thanks for being a great teammate!\n\n356#Every day is a new adventure in demand gen!|Jill, I wanted to thank you for your excellent work on all things demand gen. As priorities shift, new products and messaging are introduced, we have new audiences to target, and new tactics are suggested, it is a cycle of testing, trying and optimization that never ends. Your ability to take all of these variables, pull them into a plan, and work with the broader team to execute is super impressive. I truly appreciate all of your efforts and your dedication! Keep up the great work!\n\n357#Q1 Social Champions|Congrats on being one of the top social sharers for Q1 through VoiceStorm! Thank you for embracing this technology and helping us spread the word about our great activities!\n\n358#Resources for Resources|This is a bit overdue, but thank you all for the various critical roles you all played in getting our new online Resource Center launched.  When we kicked off, the vendor told us it was generally a 8-12 week launch period.  They hadn't met THIS marketing department yet!  From integrating with existing systems to troubleshooting forms to creating, organizing, and entering content, you all took this project to heart and helped get us online in 3 weeks!  It was truly a mad dash and you all pulled out all the stops.  Great work and thank you!\n\n359#Action Plans in Action|WorkHuman generates a buzz that gives us an enormous opportunity to follow up with prospects and customers. Each of you went above and beyond to create the Action Plans and breakout session PDFs that were emailed today. Timing was extremely important as we needed to get these out this week for optimal impact. Lauren B and Aaron – thanks for your smart copy. Lauren C, Brian, and Matt – thanks for scrambling to get the session PDFs uploaded in a timely fashion. Amanda – thanks for your wonderful eye for design. Carrie – thanks for providing photos so quickly. Alice and Kevin – thanks for your input and edits. Anthony – thanks for your Marketo expertise to get the emails properly targeted. Jill – thanks for your sales communication. And Lauren C and Amanda – double thanks for scrambling to correct the multiple PDFs that had to be resized at the 11th hour. Crazy week, crazy day – excellent result. Thank you.\n\n360#Agile Follow Up Team|S/O to all of you for your hard work and flexibility around the WorkHuman 2018 follow up plan. Lauren - You have written endless amounts of copy for the different audiences and pivoted seamlessly when plans changed due to deliverables and timing. You've been extremely calm and approachable throughout the copy/plan changes and make navigating through all of it a breeze! Laura - Thank you for keeping the Lucid chart beautifully updated with each and every \"regroup\" we have, a new version is circulated and you're on top of communicating those updates clearly to the larger team. That really has been our \"follow up bible\"! I also love our little pow-wows reviewing email copy at your desk, as this really has proven to be the best way to collaborate on managing multiple CTA's without making the message feel muddled. Finally, Jill - I can't say enough about how happy I am to have your leadership, creativity, foresight, sense of humor, and amazing attention to detail on this project. With little prior knowledge about WorkHuman (until last week), you took this program and ran with it. You saw where we needed to adjust some of the things that worked in the past and have kept your cool through all the sped up deadlines and speaker approvals etc. So happy to be working with you on this! Thank you all for being great partners and looking forward to making an impact together.\n\n361#For Customers... and teamwork|You've stepped up to help us rethink customer marketing at a pivotal time as we expand to new markets and targets with WorkHuman Cloud and look to reframe how the market thinks about their total rewards strategy. We are also facing this little task we call WorkHuman followup to gain the most from our investment with customers in Austin. Thank you for your ideas, energy, and initiative —and taking on the challenge in the midst of some of the busiest weeks ever. I'm confident that your experience, leadership, and team orientation will provide tremendous value as we go forward. Most of all I really appreciate your positive attitude! Thank you!\n\n362#Demand is in Good Hands!|Jill, it has been a pleasure to have you on board! Immediately, you have owned the budget given to you and already allocated for the quarter. Whenever we meet, you have great questions, you work to own the Allocadia tool, and you follow-up on our takeaways. I look forward to what you have in store for Q2. It is great having you as a budget manager partner!\n\n363#Captain Jill|Jill, I’ve only worked with you for a short amount of time and have already learned so much! You have an endless supply of great ideas and your attention to detail is exceptional. I’m so impressed with how quickly you’ve “captained” the demand gen ship and gotten us up and running. I feel like this is long overdue but I just want you to know that I really appreciate all the guidance you provide, your strong work ethic and the sense of humor you bring to the table. I’m so happy to be working with you!\n\n364#Webinar Masters|Thanks to all of you for taking a webinar concept to successful execution!  When our SHRM report came out, the idea of doing a webinar made total sense - but I think we were all fuzzy on the details.  Each of you (Amanda recognized separately) helped take it from a idea to a webinar with over 400 registrations.  From getting the word out, to handling the sign-ups, to handling the logistics, to the last minute slide changes 5 minutes before we went live, it was a success in the end! Well done!!\n\n365#You listened!|Jill-- A Big Huge Thank You to you for listening to us!!! You sat through our QBR's and heard us talk about the reinvesting the $$ from the Tax Break into recognition, and we had an \"ask\" for help with Marketing to push out the message to a broader audience. You heard us and got the ball rolling immediately after the QBR!! There is now a campaign and blog post around what companies can do with the tax break $$$ and can't wait to see if it makes companies think differently! Thank you very much for taking such quick action on this time sensitive \"extra money\". Can't wait to see what else you can do!! Well done! ~Allison\n\n366#CRUSHING IT!!!|Jill, you have only been here for a short time, but your impact has already been tremendous and felt all over the sales organization.  Your command of the demand gen programs and the level of detail in which you deliver them is outstanding.  Everyone knows exactly what it is and what it MEANS, and gives clear direction on where to find it and how to use it.  Thanks so much!\n\n367#You just get it!|Jill- You hit the ground running and are handling multiple Globoforce campaigns with ease. Your briefs have been super thorough! Your kickoffs have been great. You have a good grasp on what needs to be done and are on top of it all. I’m so glad we have you! Thanks for taking everything you learned so far over the past few weeks and putting it all into action! You’re a superstar!\n\n368#\"Now that you're here...\"|Jill and Laura - I've lost count of how many times I've said \"Now that you're here\" over the last 30 days. It is incredible to see how quickly you have come up to speed, plugged in to the team, and kicked-off or took over many demand generation programs. You jumped right in with both feet to GDPR, Tax Cut, webinar planning, demos for new tools we need, launching our Q1 top of funnel campaign and so much more. I'm honestly blown away! As you know we've had a gap in this area for what feels like forever, but it was 100% worth the wait! Thank you for making the decision to join Globoforce and our team.\n\n369#Onboarding with a Big Impact|Jill, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for hitting the ground running. You have been onboard for just about a month, and it feels like you've always been part of the team. You bring excellent questions to the team, help us push forward to tackle nagging little projects and really give us an outside the box perspective to drive innovation for both sales and marketing. Simple things from campaign layouts in SFDC to major ideas like resource management centers for the website wouldn't be happening without you driving the projects forward. I can't wait to see what the next few months hold for us, because you are already upping the game in all the things you've touched. Thanks for being awesome! Anne Marie\n\n370#Such an incredible first few weeks!|Jill it has been such a pleasure to work with you on the SHRM campaign these past few weeks. You're communicative, transparent and just great to work with overall! You've helped make the work for this campaign flow effortlessly. So happy to have you on the team and I can't wait to take on more projects with you in the future!\n\n371#The show must go on!|Team - Thank you all for keeping our campaigns on track this week, even while we were away at Ignite. With everyone busy and away from the office, and our laptops, you were determined to launch our SHRM Report and Top Reasons to attend WH campaigns. Thank you for going above and beyond during a very hectic few days!\n\n372#the other Dave...|Jill, thank you for introducing me to Dave, your husband.  We had a great chat about his company and some of their goals. This was a great opening conversation for me and I learned a lot about what is important there.  I appreciate you thinking of me and remembering that \"everyone is in sales\" at Globoforce.\n\n"
