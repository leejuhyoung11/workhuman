To date, you have collectively launched a whopping 114 clients! This is no small feat for a myriad of reasons, acknowledging the ~200 clients we have under our management AND all the moving parts associated with getting our clients live - from the kick-off to the mock-up to sandbox review, as well as answering all of your clients' AI-related questions from their respective AI councils. It's not an easy job, and you are each dedicating yourselves to doing a stellar job completing it. Just to tally the number of clients each of you have pushed live: Allison (13), Kate (13), Morgan (13), Steve (16) and Judith (59). Amazing, amazing effort and results. Thank you for your continued dedication to this important company milestone!\n\n2#Leader. Mentor. Motivator. Ally.|Judith, I wanted to take a moment to shine a light on all that you have accomplished over the last few months. First and foremost, you have had an immediately positive impact via your leadership role within the Evolve team - providing guidance, reassurance and ongoing learning opportunities for our Customer Success Specialists. Instituting your daily office hours with the team has proven to be a major win. Your efforts are a key ingredient in our goal to help these team members develop in their Customer Success careers here at Workhuman.  Additionally, you have:  - Played a key role in shaping Workhuman's Mid-Market GTM strategy, working with a cross-functional team (Sales, Product, Launch & CS Leadership) to build the foundation of the strategy and offering your valuable insights along the way. - Launched HI across the vast majority of the Mid-Market client base - with only a handful remaining. Along the way you've ensured that the value of HI was effectively conveyed to each client and each launch was project-managed successfully - Collaborating with me on successfully integrating Mid Market client support into the Evolve team, developing a shared support model with our 5 Customer Success Specialists and providing regular guidance/oversight to them in your new capacity as manager to these CSSs.  I am truly grateful to have you on our team, and look forward to our continued collaboration as we transform Evolve and Mid-Market!\n\n3#A Successful Return to Mid-Market!|Thank you all so much for your teamwork and support as we navigated the first Mid-Market launch since the return of Mid-Market! Caroline and Will, thank you for being so responsive and helping with the API addendum and providing context and additional details around my many questions as I started with Mortgage Connect. It was clear from Day 1 that you built an incredible foundation with Jaclyn and these additional pieces helped me keep that going. Matt and Rich, thank you for being there to brainstorm with me and offer suggestions around the current and future state of Mid-Market. The process Mortgage Connect experienced benefited from our discussions, and I know our learnings will improve key components of the launch experience for Mid-Market clients as we move forward. Judith, thank you for being my sounding board and talking through past and current experiences for Mid-Market clients. In many ways we started over with the Mid-Market process, and I'm grateful for your tribal knowledge and advice.

Evolve and Mid-Markets have been leading the way here in the early days of HI launches, and your work is helping to excite and delight customers while also delivering key learnings for our internal teams on what works/what needs refinement in the launch process. Judith, you've now launched 40+ of your Mid Market clients and are hitting the home stretch with the remainder - a massive accomplishment. Steve, all 7 of your launched clients (including Arkansas Children's, Nixon Peabody & Kentech) have sung the praises of HI's impact on their employee experience, and you've done a great job of nurturing that excitement. Allison - Apollo Global Management, Datavant, Daimler Trucking and Westfield Insurance are all now on the cutting edge of the recognition experience under your guidance. Kate - Iron Mountain, PTW and Saia are all now benefitting from HI, and it couldn't have been accomplished without you building strong relationships with the PMs and effectively illustrating the positive impacts of our innovations. Morgan - all of your clients are poised to launch over the next month and I've borne witness to your impactful HI overviews/demos. I sincerely thank each of you for helping drive our company forward with this initiative!\n\n9#Midmarket Account Rockstar! ⭐⭐⭐|Congratulations Judith, you are our category winner for most registered members in Connect across our MidMarket portfolio!

Across every workshop, what stood out was not just the quality of the ideas and actions, but the values and behaviours consistently demonstrated. There was a genuine, holistic care for the customer journey from beginning to end, exceptional cross-functional collaboration, and a clear passion for improving our customer experience.

Our conversation turned into a gold mine of story ideas, and I am so appreciative of your insights into which accounts you'd recommend for a case study with Workhuman. You provided several great leads, and I was already able to link up with Anna Maria from Bank of Princeton at the Gratitude Bar to hear firsthand what an impact Human Intelligence is having on her recognition program. Wow - thank you for planting the seed there!! I am looking forward to collaborating with you as we write and scale more mid-market customer stories this year. Thank you, Judith!\n\n17#Heart & Hustle|To everyone who traveled to Denver and rolled up their sleeves to support our flagship event—thank you.

Appreciate you!\n\n20#CS & WHiQ Feedback = Better iQ Experience for All|I'm incredibly thankful to this team—especially for your thoughtful engagement in surfacing nuanced edge cases within the Workhuman iQ user experience.  Your collaboration was especially impactful in two key areas: (1) Helping refine how we count awards in DEI for Inclusion Advisor, ensuring we represent data in a way that’s both accurate and meaningful and (2) troubleshooting and providing context around 'No Data' screens within Team Patterns and Grid, which helped clarify the experience for end users.  These observations—and your collaborative, solution-oriented mindset—are what make scaling to all clients possible. Your efforts ensure we’re considering every user persona, from individual contributors to people managers, HRX, and even the C-suite.

Thanks again!\n\n24#Wave 1 Customer Champion|Judith, I want to take a moment to actively acknowledge the incredible work you are doing to onboard our Wave 1 customers to Culture Hub, Recognition Advisor, Reward Stories, and Workhuman iQ Snapshots. You have scheduled all the kick-off calls to date, and your customers are actively submitting assets, which speaks volumes about the strong relationships you have built with them. I also appreciate the valuable insights you have been sharing with me about Mid-Market customers. Your idea to roll out Culture Hub and other HI features to standard branded customers has saved us an estimated 14+ hours of meetings. I also want to call out the constructive feedback along the way you have been prioviding to the product, marketing and GTM team, these feedback is helping us tweak our approach for roll-out. Your willingness to test and trial methods to communicate the role of these features has been extremely helpful and is helping us scale effectively.

Wave 1 Customer Kickoff Call|Today marks a significant milestone in our company’s history with the Human Intelligence 2025 Release moving from Workhuman as Customer Zero to the first Wave 1 Customer Kickoff Meeting with Silfex. As T.S. Eliot once said, “The end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” This first step is just the beginning of an exciting journey ahead. A journey it has been, together!! Hitting key milestone days need to be celebrated!   This is a monumental achievement, especially as Silfex and all Wave 1 customers prepare to launch new features that will significantly elevate the end-user experience through the Culture Hub, Reward Stories, Recognition Advisor, and iQ Snapshots. It takes a village and very detailed project plan. From creating the Human Intelligence video, to finalizing the customer kickoff deck, to solidifying roles, to writing the customer pre-meeting and post-meeting communications, to developing the communications package, to scheduling the customer meetings, to executing on the day, such collaboration and innovation in action!   The initial customer feedback to the new experience was phenomenal. Stephanie was quick to say how much she liked Reward Stories and the ability for employees to have a full-circle moment and the show the meaningful way recognition impacted the recipient. Jesse loved how intuitive the home page and experience will be, along with gathering clarity on iQ Snapshots. His eyes lit up when he realized these will be available to individual contributors and managers alike providing key insights in the flow of work. Let’s continue to ride the wave, make a splash with all of our upcoming kickoff meetings and achieve great things together! YOU are a force for GOOD!!\n\n26#The Hartford Helpers!|I wanted to give a GIANT thank you to the amazing humans here for their incredible help this last week or so in supporting the needs of my newest customer, The Hartford.

This was a tough project, but a necessary one, as ICON was the last remaining client who still had a legacy YOS program. Working together, we successfully re-launched them today with our modern Timelines/Service Milestones experience. Tracey, you did a phenomenal job preparing the client to take this big step, and leveraged your great relationship throughout the launch to navigate some choppy waters along the way!

You’ve all show great willingness and ability to both dive into details AND lead our teams to success.  Sometimes this means tracking down a billing issue, a product adjustment or issue, or working through a technical deployment and many times it means making sure that the teams see the big picture of our messaging, our value and our strategy.  It’s a tricky balance and you all have shown great leadership in your respective areas.  You done it all, leading some of our biggest customers like Cisco, Merck, Rio Tinto (Claire, Mark & Jose), to making sure those Growth customers like Cognizant, Kraft Heinz, Lincoln Financial, Circet, and Autodesk (Mike, Guil, Melissa and Robyn)  really continue to grow and see our partnership to our Evolve and MidMarket customers like Santander, Agco, LegalZoom and Sabra (Patrick and Judith) where we’ve shown that we will support all of our customers with care and concern with creativity.  You all manage so much and deliver every day for our customers and the team.  Thank you for all you do.  I hope you enjoy the holidays and can relax, reflect and refresh as we get ready for more Customer Successes in 2025.\n\n30#Question Queen|Judith, I wanted to thank you for being an incredible resource to me.

Gavin- without you they would still not be live, as my control panel push did not work, and I am sure you and your team would help Kel in the early days with the development of the program. Kel- Thank you for setting me up for success to get Aldon launched so smoothly. This project I know you have been working on for many years and I hope (when you are back from your leave) we can celebrate together!

This mitigated confusion and stress, which cannot be taken lightly going into a holiday weekend!

Cheers to the entire team behind WorkhumanLive Austin!\n\n50#Luminary Hub Hosts  - to infinity & beyond!|Melanie, Judith, Allie, Lauren, Erin & Kat: Huge kudos for being our Luminary Hub Hosts at WHL in Austin. This was a new \"space\" for us this year (of course pun intended!), to highlight & celebrate our customers' achievements and milestones, and invite all attendees into this \"space\" to connect, relax, re-fuel and experience Workhuman customer hospitality. You were the best welcoming committee around - not too intrusive but there to offer a warm smile, answer a question, or just observe. I appreciate you staying \"grounded\" in Workhuman Central to play this host role and am excited to gather your ideas on how we can make it even more of a destination area for next year. You all represent Workhuman so well (you were chosen for a reason ya know!) and am grateful for your support. I bet you have some fun people-watching stories to share from this adventure too!\n\n51#Workhuman Live Excellence|Judith, thanks for your fantastic efforts at Workhuman Live.  You personally had 15 customers in attendance and took the time to meet with them, connect and drive actions forward.  You built connections at your hosted customer dinner and allowed customers to interact with each other and were there from beginning to end.  Thanks for your energy and focus on our customers.\n\n52#Microsoft Teams Integration Gets to 100K Users!|Today we crossed a new milestone for our Microsoft Teams integration. Across all deployments we’ve now been used by 100K users in a production environment. That number comes from just 40 clients. It also represents a tremendous amount of diligence, persistence and collaboration led by you in our customer and launch success teams.   You’ve helped bring your customers thru the deployment journey, helped in test cycles and prepared and created messaging with your key stakeholders. This milestone is the first marker in meeting our clients where their users spend the bulk of their working day. And the feedback you bring out way is going into our roadmap. We’ll add approvals, media and inclusion advisor all guided by the collaboration you have enabled with our accounts.   Thanks from all of the integration team (dev, product, launch and product marketing) on getting us to this milestone. It is great working with you on this and seeing the delight in extending the Workhuman experience for our clients into Teams.  And so I have just one question ...   Who’s in for the next 400K users? 😁💪  (PS This award created via the Microsoft Teams integration, because, well of course it had to be 😊)\n\n53#Printed Award Genius!|A big thanks goes to Judith for all of the help she offers on the launch team channels! This time around, she was able to assist on a unique request my client had regarding their printed award. Judith knows the system in and out and was able to offer a workaround that solved for this ask within an hour of the request from the client. Thank you, Judith for allowing me to gain additional trust and relationship capital with my PM!\n\n54#Season of Giving Shout Out!|Shout out to the Season of Giving taskforce for yet another successful customer marketing holiday campaign (and debrief session)! Thank you to all who collaborated well in advance of the campaign kickoff and throughout the season to plan and monitor this campaign. With this cross-functional partnership these campaigns continue to improve as we drive more engagement with our customers & unlock new opportunities to encourage recognition during these important national & global holidays. Thank YOU!\n\n55#Thank you for sharing your wealth of knowledge!|Judith, thank you SO much for taking time out of your busy afternoon (amidst 75+ account reviews!) to walk me through all things YOS in Config and explain processes. I learned so much from you during our time together that will help me greatly in Arch's YOS program launch and others in the future. Appreciate you!\n\n56#Thanks for all your support!|Judith, thank you so much for the tremendous support you provided to my post-launch customers while I was away in Japan. I am truly grateful for your assistance in handling various requests, including point orders, demos, and a wide range of questions. Thanks to your dedication and expertise, I had complete peace of mind knowing that my post launch clients were well taken care of while I indulged in all the sushi Japan has to offer. Your support has been invaluable, along with the fantastic sushi recommendation you've shared with me!\n\n57#Creative solutioning!|After nearly a year in the works with some stops and starts, we're finally able to offer curated communications packages, while also providing the full Customer Central experience, to our mid-market customers. From identifying an expanded set of templates to verifying products enabled/access codes and creatively packaging and delivering content on Customer Central, you came together with your creative thinking caps on to create a scalable, customer-centric solution!  Thank you for your respect for customers!\n\n58#Launch 101|Rich & Judith – As we were working through plans for a phased launch of a new digital tool we thought, \"You know what would be great, is to hear from someone who's done this before.\" And we are so grateful to have Launch Success colleagues who were willing to share their time, resources, and expertise to help another department with some Launch 101! We took tons of notes on all the tips you shared that will positively impact the success of our project, and we are so thankful for your collaborative spirit. Thank you!\n\n59#Question Queen!|Judith - I just wanted to give a quick thank you for helping with all of the relatively complex questions and confirmations that I've been throwing out there to the greater team! You are not only happily able to provide an answer, but you even go the extra mile to schedule some time to make sure I fully understand all the complexities of the request as well as provide any addition insight or suggestions. Honestly, I have no idea what I'd do without you and your vast knowledge! Thank you thank you!\n\n60#World Gratitude Day Customer Task Force|Following our WGD reporting debrief, I wanted to take moment to recognize this amazing team of cross-functional superstars who planned, collaborated, and ideated week after week in the months leading up to WGD. Cheers to executing our most successful campaign yet: double and triple digit YOY % increases, 1M awards sent, 1M+ end users reached….and the list goes on! This was an incredible team effort from day one and the results are a testament to the dedication put forth by this team to continually enhance and support these campaigns on behalf of our customers. Well done!\n\n61#Knowledge-sharing is caring!|Judith-  thank you again for your knowledge-sharing session and being so generous with your time and educating me about the automated birthday awards. I cherish these moments and grateful for your help!\n\n62#Q3 Review|Team, I can't thank you all enough for coming to our Q3 review meeting with such amazing energy!  The participation was great and I hope everyone enjoyed playing our \"Please let me in ...\" game.  From impersonating a plumber, throwing rocks at the windows, teleporting or riding a horse through a field.  You all thought creatively when it came to solving the problem.  I'm also excited to see everyone taking on the new enhanced huddle postings with such enthusiasm.  This team is ever present and constantly striving for improvement.  Thank you for being authentic selves in our meetings and everyday.\n\n63#Holiday Cover|Thank you both for covering for me while I was off.  Judith, not only did you cover the Mid Market queue. Not only did you cover it, you also had it almost completely cleared when I came back on Monday. Usually I would be expecting to come back to several emails but this time there were only 2 outstanding that had come in over the weekend. And this week you have still been involved in it which has made coming back so much less stressful.  And Jason, when I was going on leave the ticket queue had was pushing 50 queries. When I came back we had 29. I could not have imagined such a turnaround. You personally closed 20 tickets last week and I know you were checking others tickets in the queue and from peoples feedback that you also assisted them with their tickets as well so who knows how many tickets you played apart in closing. and possibly most significantly, you spotted a potential data breach and took action on it, removing the offending file and spoke to Infosec.\n\n64#Pre-pay to Post-pay Success|I wanted to pause and recognize both of you on switching 2 MidMarket customers, FIB and SSOE, from pre-pay to post-pay. There were many moving parts, coordination among multiple teams as our system touches many departments and a few nuances learned along the way. You were working seamlessly together once the change was made to work through pending awards that snuck in pre-change, setting up spend management in this new concept and mysterious award amounts showing/unshowing. Overall, both were as smooth as possible thanks to all your prep work and collaboration. Congratulations!\n\n65#BP Datafile|Judith, Thanks for helping us in product in providing details on the BP datafile. I appreciate the urgency and teamwork in giving us the insights we needed to follow up on some product discovery. Thank You!\n\n66#Gratitude for you all|Happy World Gratitude Day!  Amy, Jose, Danielle, Christa, Rich, Michelle & Judith. What a fantastic set of leaders you all are.  From leading your teams to working through issues to making sure all the pieces fit together for our customers, you are all wonderfully talented and driven.  I appreciate you every day (yes even weekends and holidays!) and am so grateful that I get to work with you.\n\n67#Grateful for the Config Program Setup Walkthrough|Judith, thank you for walking me through the config process for setting up a program. We are truly grateful for your expertise; the recording of that process has really helped PMs and folks in engineering understand our product more. Your thorough explanations and patience made it easy for everyone to grasp the concepts and feel confident moving forward. Thank you for your tremendous support!\n\n68#Help with SMB Client Setup|This award is long overdue guys...  I just wanted to say a big thanks for all your assistance last month with the setup of the SMB client which be a great help to the business when validating the onboarding of new merchandise suppliers.  With the imminent sunset of WH Cloud For Teams,  the business needed an alternative option for validating the fulfilment and invoicing capabilities of new merchandise suppliers and so the setup of the SMB client was absolutely critical in ensuring there was no break in service to this vital business process.  Thanks once again for all your support here.\n\n69#Bearing with Barings!|Hi Folks! Just wanted to express my appreciation for all your help with Barings. There was a few moving parts and awards with near identical names but between all of us, we figured it out! Thank you all again and enjoy the award!\n\n70#Brother call|Thank you for coming on the call today with Brother. Your help and advice especially with the account level, branding and financial factors that come into merging programs and/or adding users to each others file was invaluable.  I would not have been able to do the call without you.  Enjoy the award :)\n\n71#Launch Team Q2 Review Meeting|I want to thank everyone for coming prepared and fully invested into our launch team Q2 review meeting.  These meetings are successful because of everyone's participation.  Whether you attended in person, remotely, or by providing email feedback in advance due to being on site for a customer launch!  This team is dedicated to delivering an exceptional experience for our customers and it shows during these meetings where we laugh, learn and reflect.  The best part was learning that one LSM has never had ice cream on top of their cake.\n\n72#Exceptional Teammate|Thank you for your help on Friday, and a lot of other days, but mainly on Friday. You took a call from me which I thought would be relatively short but you took so much time to go through a couple of client issues I had and helped me on the path to resolution. You were also able to identify another potential issue which needed attention and again explained what is needed for that.  To be even more helpful, you even reached out today to offer more assistance if necessary. I depend on you so much for help and just generally for support so an award is the least you deserve\n\n73#Bringing Out the Magic!|Judith, thank you so much for making magic happen during my client call! I appreciate your support, as we needed you, our fairy god mother to help with some special requests! By the end of the call we came up with a specialized solution that brings Community Health Center one step closer to launching! Thanks for always having a glass slipper ready when we need it!\n\n74#Brain Trust|This is long overdue as I wanted to thank each of you for your support you’ve provided me over the last little while, including last week. The support varies from crafting training materials, backend testing, demos, project support, managing customer responses and calls, validation on configuration/data files/my knowledge and escalation coverage. Your combined support has provided confidence in the support Workhuman is providing to our customers and continuing their trust in us. Thank you for allowing me to tap into this brain trust and I appreciate each of you!\n\n75#Expressing Gratitude for Support and Collaboration|I would like to extend my sincere gratitude for the invaluable support and collaboration that has been generously provided. Your efforts are instrumental in achieving our research objectives and I am truly grateful for your partnership. Let us continue to work hand in hand towards our shared goals with the same level of passion, commitment, and enthusiasm. Thank you!\n\n76#Helping Hands|Robert & Judith, just wanted to show my appreciation for your efforts yesterday regarding the datafiles for Frequency. My shift was coming to an end and there was a huge delay with the datafiles queue but you both stepped up to lend a helping hand. In the end, we got it done!  Thank you both so much.\n\n77#Humantheoners on fire (in a good way of course)!|To this amazing group of Humantheoners at WHL - THANK YOU! You were placed in the inner sanctum of Workhuman Central, drawing people in, piquing their curiosity, engaging them in conversation, encouraging them in all sorts of creative ways to touch the screens, AND for customers to leave us G2 reviews... I think this could make a great episode for Mike Rowe's \"dirty jobs\" show! And yes, I think for next year, we need to have signs like the image on this award so you don't lose your voice repeating it all day long. I loved popping in to this area and seeing  the interactions taking place and appreciate all of your efforts - being \"on\" as a resource for any & all attendees and never quite knowing what might get asked of you truly is one tough role to be in, and you all crushed it!  I'm so grateful -  you getting a huge \"WHOO HOO\" from me...and I don't give those out lightly :)\n\n78#Thank you|I just wanted to say many thanks for all your time and help with the recent review of the Customer Request Management process.

Your efforts created an unforgettable experience for over 1,500 attendees and reconfirmed our event as the world's leading HR conference.  Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention. Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n80#Employee Appreciation Day Task Force|The numbers speak for themselves! Thank you to each and every member of the Employee Appreciation Day weekly customer task force! From precise planning leading up to March 3…to troubleshooting setbacks and planning for future success….the partnership surrounding this campaign was incredible! The contributions of every individual were invaluable and many of you came to the table during our debrief to offer compelling suggestions to enhance our holiday campaigns going forward. We walked away with new ideas to improve internal & external communication, recommendations that will help us uncover deeper billings & redemption insights, and suggestions to ensure these celebrations continue to result in a great experience for our customers. Looking forward to applying these learnings and knocking the upcoming national & global celebrations out of the park!  World Gratitude Day---here we come!

I had many new items cross my desk for the first time and this team stepped up to share there expertise. Things like Crosswalks, Workday API Integrations, Birthday awards, and country specific years of service programs.  I have also recieved support with data file retrieval when my jump box wasn't working  and  new  data file review. Weeks like these I am so grateful for my team.\n\n82#WHL Registration Contest Winner!|Judith, Great work on securing two groups of customer registrations for Workhuman Live, taking the top spot for the customer contest.  Thanks to your advocacy for the event and your account relationships, a team of twelve (!) from Delaware Supermarkets and three from Aldon will be onsite in San Diego.  As you know, building upon our customer relationships is critical to Workhuman’s long term business success and Workhuman Live is the ideal place to cultivate those affiliations.  Thank you for the effort and congratulations!\n\n83#Wearing multiple hats|Judith -  I wanted to pause to acknowledge all that you’ve been doing. You’ve done an amazing job with bringing the team up to speed to lead launches so you can focus on other areas. You’ve been pulled into managing MM escalations, helping define a short term point order form to alleviate internal concerns and most recently you’ve been working through some difficult conversations. It’s not easy and you’ve approached the situation with kindness and compassion while being firm. I believe in all that you do to better the team (and the extended team), and I see you and all your efforts, Judith!\n\n84#Awesome Leaders|As we wrap up Employee Appreciation Day, I wanted to take a minute to thank this awesome team of leaders for your support.  While today’s events were a great an example of how you all come together to work around and through issues for our customers.  And you do this every day. You bring yourselves fully to ensure we are there for our customers and you all lead your teams with strength, professionalism, and humanity.  I appreciate you all every day and am honored to work with you.  Thanks.\n\n85#The \"Madonna\" of Workhuman|Judith! Our call today with Apex and Medikeeper was a huge success thanks to your proactivity to collaborate and share your expertise as we navigate uncommon territory. This deal has been a little tricky to navigate but I think you nailed it with everything you shared an talked about. The 2 main things I learned today were 1. What great care our prospects will be in once they become customers and 2. How to say your last name (Colan-twahno). Cheers to many more wins and many more Louis!\n\n86#Happy Employee Appreciation Day!|Thank you for all that you do, but more importantly all that you uniquely bring to this team. With gratitude, AP\n\n87#Always Supportive ✨|Judith, thank you for always taking time out of your day to help the Mid-Market team. In the past few weeks, you've been in many back-to-back meetings, yet you still make time for us! You even jumped on a call with me to review a few project plans at the end of your day on Friday! Thank you for all the never ending support you give to the Mid-Market team!\n\n88#A moment that mattered ❤ LSM|Leaving our team sessions yesterday, I felt inspired, supported, and proud to be part of the launch team. Thank you to this leadership team that put the event together and thinking through the whole day to even the smallest details (the dots). Judith and Rich there was great care in putting together an impactful agenda that seamlessly combine both Mid-Market and larger launches together. Amy the appreciation exercise was like nothing I have ever experiences and was extremely motivational! We do have an amazing team! Thank you!\n\n89#2023 Launch Team Offsite|Team, I can not thank you enough for bringing your wholeself to our Launch Team Offsite, coming right off the heels of Activate.  Everyone did such a great job participating and leaning into each and every topic.  As a group we were able to launch 66 brand new customers, averaging 172 days from contract to launch in 2022.  We had great guest speakers and every one of you ensured your voice was heard in each session.  I'm very excited to see what 2023 bring to this team.  Thank you for being authentic, thoughtful and involved!\n\n90#Thank you :)|Hi Judith,  Thanks for advising me on the encoding issue for Cynosure.

Thank you :)\n\n91#You are a big part of why week 1 was great for me|Judith! It was a total pleasure meeting you at Activate. If you couldn't tell early on, you made a great impression when we first met. You were warm, inviting, and you really took the time to help orient me to what I was a part of on-site.  That's why I kept finding you in the days that followed!  In our time together, I learned you have a strong ability to clearly explain the business, the teams and players within and some of the nuances of how we work and why we operate the way we do. You played a big role in helping me leave Activate feeling like I'd gained the knowledge of weeks of 'in-office' time.... in just two days at the event. Thank you for being so selfless and helpful despite the busy schedule you had on-site.\n\n92#Presentation Moral Support|Gang, I wanted to call out some amazing kind messages I received midweek when I presented GIFs to the customer success group. You all reached out directly on slack with some kind words and messages. Honestly it meant so much!!! Its the first major product release my squad have done and it was amazing to see the excitement for this. Thank you all for your kindness and awesome messages of support and excitement for the new feature!!! You are all the best!!! 😄\n\n93#Always the answer|Judith, thanks very much for dealing with a query for one of our Mid-Market Clients. I received the query, but I was at a loose end for a resolve. I reached out to you and got your usual response \"of course I'll help\"  you responded to the client providing the data needed. Its great to know that your only a keyboard click away. Super helpful. Thanks Judith. Enjoy\n\n94#Great 2022!|Hey Everyone, as we approach 2023 I wanted to take a moment and thank the people who helped me throughout 2022. All of you have been extremely responsive if I reach out with a question or a last minute ask that needs to be prioritized, ensuring that our customers have a smooth launch, and knowing I have that support goes a long way while trying to execute as a sales rep. Selling truly is a team sport, and Workhuman (and more specifically the Mid-Market Team) wouldn't be able to do what we do without you all! Thanks!\n\n95#Mid-Market Superstars|Judith and Alex, I wanted to thank you both so much for being so helpful and supportive with the Mid-Market clientele and for helping me along the way this year. You have both been there whenever I have had questions regarding topics of Mid-Market whether it was new deals or existing deals. The Mid-Market branch is so lucky to have you both as team players! You are both extremely knowledgeable; I look forward to continue working with you to grow and further my knowledge of Mid-Market services and nuances! I hope you have a wonderful new year and can't wait for 2023!\n\n96#2022 Wrap Up - Mid Market|Another year has ended and not a day has gone by where I haven't learned something from you once again.  We have done an extraordinary job with mid-market clients in terms of spending (8 digits figures in points purchase are an amazing result) and minimizing the risk that some of them will run out of points or have their contract expired  This has had a big impact in terms of customer satisfaction.  Personally, I thank you because, from day one, you have always taken my work and ideas into consideration, even in those rare times that they haven't been brilliant :D\n\n97#Great leaders in 2022|Rich, Amy, Jose, Danielle, Cam, Michelle, Christa, Judith you are fantastic leaders for the team.  On today’s all hands’ call you highlighted the successes of your team members and many of them provided quotes that we added to the attached video (thank you Amanda Salvas!).    You all bring such drive, compassion, knowledge and strategy to our customers and teams’ needs.  You bring your whole selves to the work at hand and ensure your teams have the opportunity to thrive.  As you can see from their comments, they appreciate you all (as do I).  Thank you for all for everything you’ve done in 2022 and I’m looking forward to continued success in 2023.\n\n98#My incredible leadership team|In today’s All Hands meeting, you all spoke about the incredible accomplishments each of your team’s have accomplished. I wanted to take a moment for you. Your biggest accomplishment as a leader goes beyond the customer work. That's expected to jump in on an escalation and problem solve for customer satisfaction. The accomplishment I want to highlight are the type of leaders you are for your teams. Rich, Michelle and Judith - you support each person on your respective team, listening, coaching and encouraging them to be their best. If you have a team that feels at their best, that carries over into the amazing customer work they do. Couple that with your courage, passion, confidence and ambition to keep pushing yourself and us forward. The teams of Launch, Technical Services and Mid-Market absolutely crushed it this year under your leadership. Thank you for all you do!\n\n99#The Mobile Solutions|Team, thank you all for your expertise, advise guidance and readiness to help figure out a path forward for Patterson's mobile experience. As we are getting ready to launch next week some concerns about how the mobile experience works with a YOS plateau program only. This group pulled together with creative solutions, a strong understanding of how things have worked in the past and the flexibility to help with testing. I am so grateful for this village that I work with every day and each of you! Thanks!\n\n100#Make Everyday Account!|Judith, the Mid-Market team wanted to wish you a HUGE congratulations on Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Launch!  You made every day account (I hope you like puns!). All of your hard work on this launch truly shines through.

We know this launch was a labor of love!\n\n101#Thank You|Thanks Judith for all your help with my many SMB queries whether recently or in months gone by. Your knowledge is second to none and your collaboration is much appreciated, thanks and enjoy the award, Sean\n\n102#\"Judith will know!\"|This is a sentence that comes out of my mouth just about every week! I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge and thank you. I so often look to you not only to answer questions, but also confirm, support and creative solution, anything I bring your way. So thank you for being you. I don't think I say it enough!! Your commitment to our customers and more importantly the team is beyond compare.\n\n103#Post Launch Survey Re-imagined|Thank you to this team for re-imagining the Post Launch Survey for Corporate/Enterprise and in the same process, we have also introduced the PLS for MidMarket! The expertise from the Customer Experience/Data Insights team allowed us to evolve our question curation to maximize impact. Added on top of that our new tool, Qualtrics, for greater flexibility for conditional questioning – targeting survey recipients to ask questions specific to the role they played. The trickiest part was our testing of the SFDC integration to automate the process for efficiency. I appreciate each of you as we worked through this process, testing and more testing for a successful outcome! I’m so excited to have this live.\n\n104#Thank you|Judith I just want to thank you for all of the support you have given me since I started. So many of our weekly calls have involved me asking you random questions or you sharing some knowledge about a particular client or process.  Even though we have geographically miles apart I always know you are there to help me when I need it and allow me to talk through some scenarios\n\n105#Dream Team|Thank you all for support recently bringing on new clients! Implementation is a huge value add throughout the process and these new clients are definitely seeing why we talk it up so much - again, thanks to you!

You all are the best!\n\n106#MM next generation|Thank you all for investing your time this week to help us understand the lay of the land in our current mid-market GTM.

Thank you for your ideas, feedback, data and spirit of teamwork and collaboration.  Onward and upward!\n\n107#BOD meeting support - ASAP!|Judith, Danielle - Thank you for your superior responsiveness and unyielding team work and support for some last minute BOD meeting prep requests.

I admire your expertise and willingness to help your fellow human!  It means a lot to me! Thank you!\n\n109#This Team is on Fire! 🔥|Congratulations to you both for launching Apollo Fire Detectors! Judith, you have done an amazing job partnering with Robin to support this launch. Your knowledge has paved the way for both of us to learn so much in just a short amount of time. Robin, you did a fantastic job leading this launch! Thank you for sharing all of your new found knowledge about our API! I appreciate you both so much for sharing your insights during this process. This team is on fire!\n\n110#Celebrating Bravery & Unfiltered Feedback|Launch team, I wanted to thank you all for your courage and authenticity during our recent round of project management process interviews, in preparation for the upcoming Asana rollout. Having dedicated time to talk through each of your feelings and ideas for the next generation of launch individually was such a gift. While it may have felt uncomfortable for some, the feedback from every single person was unique and valuable. You all understood the assignment and came ready with fantastic insights. My hope is that at the end of this month, you each see yourself reflected in the initial Asana rollout; it wouldn't have happened without you!\n\n111#Sorting things out...|Thank you so much Judith for helping me with a question about awards and excel. Not only did you reach out last night on slack, but you met up with me at 8:30 this morning over zoom to figure out how I was doing things. You rock!\n\n112#Guiding Hand|I just want to thank you for the support you gave me last week when we were short staffed and some things were coming up that perhaps I hadnt seen before or was unsure of. Your support which is constant but more needed last week especially with Alnylam took a huge amount of pressure off of me and in this case allowed for a positive ending considering the reason for the call in the first place\n\n113#Grateful to be part of an amazing team|What an amazing group of humans that I am grateful to call my team! Over the last few months, I have been challenged in new ways personally and professionally. This group without missing a beat has been there to support me as a whole human. Helping my clients move forward, being a friendly ear or answering an SOS for help through Slack. In my career, I have never worked on a team that had each other’s back as much as this group of humans. Thank you and Go Launch!\n\n114#The best support!|Cam, Jamie, and Judith - Thank you all for gathering for an internal regroup and then a client-facing discussion with BMS.  Due to a recent acquisition of another WH client, there are some internal moving parts to decide and finalize.  We were able to help the team understand the current state of Turning Point's agreement and what the future state could look like.  As BMS is one of our more strategic clients, I truly appreciate the partnership in ensuring a smooth transition.  We are their trusted advisor and they value us for certain.  Thank you for all that you do!\n\n115#Grateful for your leadership & support|Since day one, each of you has been unwavering in your support of me, and our efforts to help this team and this market segment grow in every possible definition of the word.  Our people, processes, thinking, and our culture. I'm grateful every day to have such a great team that I can laugh with, learn from, and grow with, and I know our best work is yet to come. THANK YOU!\n\n116#Legacy vs Timelines Crash Course|I can’t thank you enough for taking time out of your busy day to collaborate on a ticket that only someone with your experience could decipher. It was great working with you in person in the office!!\n\n117#Leaders who Get Stuff Done!|On this World Gratitude Day, I want to this fantastic group of leaders to know how much you are appreciated and how much impact you have for the team, our customers, and our business. You lead team members, you work through issues, you guide and coach, you recruit talented humans, you motivate customers and make sure that customers’ voices are heard by the rest of the company.  Thank you for being you, bringing your talent every day, and getting “stuff” done.  With gratitude....\n\n118#Grateful for you!|Judith! I just wanted to take a moment to say how grateful the Mid-Market team is to have you. You are the guiding light to us each of us every day. You have the utmost patience when it comes to supporting the team. We are so so so grateful for your support and knowledge.\n\n119#Launch and CL&S Meet and Greet|We have many new faces on the Launch side and on the CL&S side. We interact on tickets and calls so it was wonderful to put faces to names and get to know each other a little more. Fun facts we learned include our love of cats and dogs, painting miniature figurines, a drummer in a band, basketball coach, love of travel, sharing childhood video games with your son, amateur photographer, bartender extraordinaire, previous life in the TV world, hitting every baseball stadium, getting married at a living history museum, meeting your spouse at work and speaking Arabic, but we will still be after you Stephen for the fun fact that will only be shared over drinks. We look forward to our work together and continuing to meet the rest of our team members!\n\n120#Midmarket Insights|Judith, Thank you for spending time with me today to walk through the specifics of our model around mid market.  You were patient in answering my questions on how to take care of our customers and drive growth for the business.  It was also inspiring and impressive to hear about your journey of creating a new opportunity for the company!  Thank you again!\n\n121#High-Five for Huntsman!|Judith, you are an inspiration! As Huntsman is preparing for their launch day Monday, you have successfully handled many tough situations. Not only did you handle them with grace, but also speed!

Thank you for everything you have done to get them ready for launch!\n\n122#Know It All's and I LOVE It !|Girls , I can't thank you enough for your teamwork yesterday getting me over the swag material and making sure it was ok for me to send to a prospect without having NDA's in place. You both are lifesavers for me. I can literally go to you for everything and anything and you will have the answers and material I need or know where to get it! Thank you for everything you do!\n\n123#Customer stories make the journey real|Folks, Thanks for sharing your stories at the all hands meeting yesterday.  Judith, it's great to hear about Alphabest and how this small, but mighty customer is impacting their culture and their community.  Kate, your examples of using 1 year program anniversaries for Conga and KraftHeinz showed us a how your using these milestone to engage the participants AND the program owners. Suzanne,  your description of getting Citizens live showed your tenacity at working with the customer and around issues to get them live.  Kristine, your walk through of how you showed Veritas how Inclusion Advisor could be used was a creative idea and very compelling.  Jamie, your walkthrough of Westfield's launch showed how we can move beyond \"lift and shift\" and your celebration of the customers' 45th anniversary was inspirational.  All of you showed great creativity with these customers and I truly appreciate you sharing these.  This is how we learn.  Thank you!\n\n124#Spark Leadership Graduation!|Congratulations to you all for graduating from the Spark Leadership program.  To get to this point you had to commit a significant amount of time, 6 sessions over the past few months.  In addition, there was pre-work and follow-up for each session.  Somehow you managed to join the sessions with energy and enthusiasm to learn.  Donna, Mallory and I enjoyed working with you over the past few months and wish you luck on the continuation of your leadership journey.  Thank you and congratulations!\n\n125#Workday Alignment|Judith, and Rob thank you both for your recent support in a Workday alignment meeting we had earlier this week with a strategic account we are getting deeper in the process with. Thanks to both of your outstanding expertise, and support we now have some additional relationships built, and are now one step closer to earning their partner of choice. It takes a village on both sides of the buying process, and I greatly appreciate the knowledge you provided for the conversation.\n\n126#Demo Practice Appreciation!|Thank you so much for taking the time to practice my demo with me! Your feedback was so helpful, and I feel far more confident heading into the certification now.  I’m so grateful to have your support and to have you as my manager!\n\n127#Demos, Demos, Demos!|Judith, I am so grateful to have you has my manager. Thank you for all the time you have dedicated to me to excel my learning and be my guide for success. Not only did you run through a practice demo with our team, but our one-on-one practice was crucial for my success. Thank you for teaching me all the tips and tricks when it comes to the Mid-Market demo site!\n\n128#Teamwork makes the dream work!|THANK YOU, Judith, for all of your help to make sure the customer lounge was a wonderful space for everyone. From making customers feel welcome, giving me a break to run to the restroom, sharing a laugh and a snack, all the way to helping us pack up the boxes at the end of WHL (I am still feeling so bad about your forehead!) you were such a huge help and support throughout. After all that, somehow we still didn't manage to get a photo together! I hope you know how much I appreciate you.\n\n129#Above and Beyond!|A MASSIVE Thank You to each of you for your support at WH Live. There are probably not enough or the perfect words to describe how effortlessly helpful and instrumental each of you were for me in seamlessly navigating and conducting research with attendees at the event. From a beautiful slide introduced into the rotating deck in the customer lounge, shout out to Meghan & Amanda, great idea and execution! Introducing me to many clients in your perfected professional manners opened the floor to many fruitful discussions, shout out to Judith, Melissa, and Jose! I feel very fortunate to know such amazing humans as you. I was given the grand tour from Judith as soon as I stepped into the main area and the rest was a researcher's dream. Thank you each for all you did as there is SO much more, and for ensuring I always had a place in the oasis that was the customer lounge 🤩 It was great to see you all in person and lovely to chat and catch up, with those of you whom I've not seen in person in a long time and for those, I was meeting for the first time. Thanks for being you!\n\n130#Wining and Dining|Team! Thank you all for making our prospect dinners run smoothly throughout WHL. From the planning, to the scheduling, to the execution, we succeeded in treating our prospects to a great time and building valuable relationships. We handed off talking points and supported each other balancing personal and business. But something to note: never order crab legs at a prospect dinner!\n\n131#Thank you|I just wanted to recognize you for taking time out of your busy days to meet with me to help me have a greater understanding of WH and the roles you and your teams fulfill.  It made such a difference to my learning process and initial experience of WH\n\n132#100 MidMarket Launches!|You’ve hit a new milestone, Judith - 100 MidMarket Launches!

I know the MidMarket internal team will raise a glass with us in your honor on your leadership and launch efforts! Congratulations!!\n\n133#CAA Superstar|Judith, thank you so much for all of your help during the CAA rebrand and Echelon merger. You were instrumental in getting us to the finish line and sharing so much amazing knowledge with me throughout the process. You were an amazing parter and continue to be as we iron out the final issues. Thank you so much!\n\n134#Thanks for being an awesome leader!|Thanks for making me feel so welcome and supported during my first few days! I'm so excited to be a part of your team, and to have the opportunity to learn from you\n\n135#Launch Team - Continuous Improvement Team Meeting|Team, thank you for coming together for the 2nd time this year to celebrate Q1 wins and collaborate on launch process improvements.  I was inspired by Nick's segment on trust and found another great Michael Jordan quote, \"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.\"  We have such a talented group of individuals, all coming together ensuring that we are always delivering the best launch experience for our customers!\n\n136#The Best Leader! (●'◡'●)|Judith,  Thank you for being such an amazing leader and manager. I am grateful for your guidance during my first week at Workhuman.\n\n137#Launch Q&A for Mid Market|JUDITH! Thank you for making time for the mid market sales team to go over some common themes with launching a new recognition program for clients. It was extremely helpful and we loved getting your insight into ways too make the process, not only seamless for the customer, but a breeze for our departments.\n\n138#Mid-Market Crash Course + 1M questions|Judith - this is a very overdue thank you for helping me get up to speed in mid-market. I went to you to ask for a MM crash course to understand the differences and nuances that exist. I wanted to know all the things. And you delivered with 3 hour long sessions that were massively helpful. I also try very hard to only ask you 1-2 questions a day, but that doesn't always happen. You are responsive and so helpful every time. I appreciate you very much and I'm so glad that we get to work together. Cheers!\n\n139#Mia says Thank You!!!|Some women say going through the Maternity Leave transition is hard. Glad to speak for me; you all made it easy from taking on new launches to post launches. You dedicated time answering loads of customer questions, hosting weekly calls, and configuration work. While handling your existing launches. Thanks to you, I was able to care for Mia with ease. Thanks for living out our “Respect for teamwork.”\n\n140#Launch Team Offsite|Team, I want to thank each and every one of you for a great Team Offsite!  All of you participated fully, sharing your experiences, tips and words of encouragement.  From sharing your fun facts to leaning in how to show empathy to customers during a launch, I could not be prouder of the amount of \"yes and's\" that were used along with thoughtful discussions focused on Moments That Matter during a launch.  We celebrated 2021, highlighted the achievements of each other, and recognized our collective accomplishments.  I'm so excited to see what 2022 brings to each of you individually and as a team!  Remember, we are not just launching a program, we are helping our customers launch a culture!\n\n141#Testing 1, 2, 3...|Judith - I cannot thank you enough for all of your help and guidance on our latest quest to better the budgeting and recognition experience for Exact Sciences. You have lead the charge on working with all the necessary parties to see if we can make this a seamless transition for Exact to switch from their current way of doing things into something completely new for them. Your dedication to ensuring this is tested thoroughly so it's perfect for Exact does not go unnoticed. I am always learning new things from you and am really lucky to have you as a partner on this project!!\n\n142#A Bird? A Plane?...No it's Judith with a cape !|After spending countless time frantically searching for an image I needed for an urgent task, Judith within seconds of my SOS call swooped in with her cape and saved the day by directing me to the correct folder and dropping the image via slack. Thank you again for quickly sending this over so that I could have this task ready for the client!\n\n143#Brainstorming for  a better approach|I would like to thank you for the work you are doing to provide Exact Sciences with a better approach to recognition.  They signed as a SMB customer but have grown and now need an alternative approach. Judith thank you for leading the way on this with conversations with folks in finance, billing & technology. Your knowledge of the current landscape and considerations that are required to move to a new approach are critical in moving this forward. Kristine, your partnership with this customer allows us the time to explore the best options. Thank you for being so thoughtful in the updates you are providing, keeping the customer informed without overpromising & focusing on the end result. Rachel thank you for being involved in these internal discussions and supporting the team as we progress.  This is a team effort & I appreciate the role each of you is playing!\n\n144#Launch Team Champions!!!|Dear Launch Team, I wanted to send this recognition in light of what was definitely the busiest ever year for the launch team. There has been some super significant and biggest ever launches(YET!!) with Accenture, IBM/Kyndryl and more. Looking back on the launch notes of Jan 2021, seeing launches like Edgewell, RGP, Cree, LogMeIn, Organon and much more,  reminds me of all the incredible hard work and dedication that was done in the year. I am so glad that I have the privilege of hosting our weekly Launch Meetings and interacting and collaborating with all of you wonderful humans. RingTheGong is now one of my favorite slack channels to celebrate all the successes we have together. It's incredible to see how much is achieved. Over the year you have had new hires and its clear with all the new additions, the launch team is going from strength to strength. Amy you are outstanding at leading this team. Rich, You are the champion of the launch processes. Liz, you have just gone and launched our biggest ever client (#legend), Judith you know everything there is to know about launch and the true leader of SMB's), Shawn you are continuously knocking it out of the park and my go to with any launch question, Matt C, every launch of yours I see goes so smoothly. Matt G, every launch we work on I am reminded of your dedication to delivering the best product and success to our clients. Kat,  seeing your 1 YOS recently reminds me of how much work you have gone through that year, incredible. Kel, working with you on Kyndryl showed me how awesome you truly are and how much great things there are to come. Nick, seeing Hess pop up on Ring the Gong just reminds be of the amazing work your doing. Jen, Rahul and Jamie, I have enjoyed collaborating with you so far and you have all been a joy to work with. Looking forward to all the future launches and I am so excited to see what is to come. It is truly an honor working with you all and I am excited to see what 2022 brings for you.\n\n145#It's just a link......|It's just a link.....or is it? I want to thank you all for your assistance in getting a customer's production link to me. You all responded quickly and helped me understand the error code. While it may just seem like a link, the turnaround time was critical and I appreciate you all.\n\n146#Standing Ovation|As the last of our launches in 2021 now live, I have to pause and acknowledge all of your efforts this year.  You had a combined 76 net new and post launch projects – take a bow!  It’s a grind of patience, consulting, leading, managing and of course rinse and repeat on the same customer.  You all have incredible talent to bring work human to our customers. The  passion for their success and giving them the best program possible is clear across this team. I hope you all pause and reflect on your own journey this year, how you’ve done individually and as a team. And Rich…You lead from the front with confident, conviction and courage. You push the boundaries for more for each team member to be their best, for our processes and for yourself. Thank you all for an incredible year!\n\n147#SMB Spend Migrations|We Did It!! Finally we have got to the endpoint where remaining SMB clients that were on the old iteration of spend management have been migrated over to v2. There was a long road to getting this across the line and each of you helped along the way. Fiona, thanks for all the detail and documentation on how the migration should be handled. Meghan and Judith, thanks for all the assistance, planning and management of the launch. Leading us to such success! Finally Liz, Thanks for being on hand when we migrated yo check the newly migrated client on Finance MD App to ensure all was good. Without you all these migrations wouldn’t have been a success. Thank You All!!\n\n148#General Dynamics Has Launched!|Team, this has been a long time coming! We started the General Dynamics launch way back in March of 2022, and today's the day - they launched their GD Excellence program! This launch team has stuck with the client the whole way. Judith, I'm totally blown away and grateful for your support - in 9 months you showed me what it means to be an amazing co-lead. With your help and careful guidance, we turned a super-conservative, nervous client into one who buys into more of the Workhuman philosophy than we thought they ever would, and they're launching a well thought-out program. You also spearheaded early conversations about physical YOS packs, and while that didn't end up becoming part of the final program, the client really appreciated your partnership there. Maggie, the client took so long on this project that you sometimes had to duck out for other priorities, but when you came back into the fold, I was amazed to see you pick up right from where you left off. This was a tricky client, but you demonstrated the best of Workhuman's flexibility and respect for customers in all of your meetings with them. Cliona... the branding. Oh, my, gosh, the branding. You were super generous with your time and patient during the MANY iterations of the branding that they threw our way. And Laura, when you came in right at the end to support Cliona while she was out of office, the client appreciated the continuity of style and responsiveness! Kelsey, you delivered an amazing and beautiful set of internal campaign assets, which is a huge help to a client whose main contacts are not super design- or creative-focused. Bryar, you were a huge help during the launch, especially right at the very end when the client was extremely concerned about their production data file; you validated at least 5 times! Last but not least - Steen, I appreciated how well you kept up with this project even though it was off-hours meetings for you. Congratulations to the whole team!\n\n149#First new hire in the books|Congratulations on your first new hire as a manager, Judith! I’m excited to have Tucker onboard as you build out the MidMarket team. You did your due diligence meeting with a few other candidates to ensure your first hire was a great fit. With the interview team, topics and internal process under your belt, you are ready to repeat the process for your other open reqs! Congrats again!\n\n150#Launch Process Improvements|Team, I want to thank everyone for coming to our Process Improvement Meeting with open minds and positive attitudes.  Everyone was engaged while we discussed the \"Sales to Launch Handover Process\", \"Client Introduction Call setup and execution\", \"Agenda Management\" and \"Launch to Customer Success Handover Process\". Having a mindset for constant incremental improvement is the key.  Our goal was progress, not perfection.  Although with this team I'm confident perfection is around the corner!  I'm so proud of the team and how everyone has leaned in as we tackled each improving each process.  Thank you all for being present, participating, and doing your part to ensure the very best launch experience for our customers!\n\n151#Conversations says hello to IBM!|Congratulations, team, on delivering the last significant piece of functionality for IBM - Annual Reflections!  This experience, along with all of the other milestones delivered for IBM, is a moment worth celebrating.    IBMers have been front of mind for this team for over a year.  You have all consistently gone above and beyond to deliver for the customer and Workhuman.  Your product and support experiences touch the entire IBM organization, making the employee experience at IBM exceptional and more human.   Be proud of the work you have done to reach this massive milestone - we are!  Cheers, The Chris' (French & Campbell)\n\n152#Champion of Launch|Judith, I dont think I am exaggerating saying you are the champion of launch. With over 100+ launches and counting. I still get blown away everytime we are on the launch review call that there is like 5 or more upcoming launches in the space of about a month. You always manage to stay on top of everything and get them to a successful launch. The detail in the launch review meetings always is always great and you make it look so easy. This is when I know from working on tickets how challenging the launches can be, the blockers we may hit. There has been a lot of these we have collaborated on. When I look back through each of them, at the steps that the launch process goes through. For example, All the requests that come in as SR's for instance SSO, have all the documentation and metadata ready to go and this just makes the whole process far easier for us all configuring these changes. I personally don't know what we would do without your launch skills and I know this is only benefiting others on the launch team. I know when I have a question, your one of the first I go to. As well as the occasional time check... lol I would add to all of the above. Concurrently we have jointly be proceeding with the SMB spend management migration from v1 to v2 which we now have had 2 successful migrations!! This was something no one ever did before and its a huge win for these clients.  Thanks for everything!!!\n\n153#Bring in 1M deal in Mid-Market!|Thank you to this entire group for helping us close our largest Mid-Market client to date!   It all started thanks to you Eileen! Your relationship with Susan while she was a Bechtel, had her call you directly to kick off this discussion.  You and Dave rocked that first meeting with their CHRO and that foundational relationship paved the way for us to have tough discussions w/ Realtor, understand the competition and what it took for us to win the deal!    Dave your expertise and tools helped us secure the 1% of payroll and drive towards such a healthy IPE ( $555).  You also helped along the way with strategy and critical discussions.   Jenna and Chris, one of the critical pieces of this deal was a partnership with their SWAG vendor.  Although you had built a relationship with 2 new partners you were willing to evaluate and ultimately successfully agreed to partner w/ Brand Fuel (their selected vendor).   Michael and Orlagh, their IT security review was multifaceted and no easy task, piled onto MULTIPLE other deals/assessments you were running and believe deadlines were in the midst of PTO.    Emily and Julia, surprisingly even with the size of this deal it wasn't our most painful negotiation, but it required some creative work and the use of our new OF.  Lastly Chris and Tom, thank you!  This was a unique approach to bookings and having a MM client commit to an upfront purchase and annual investment to allow us to extend discounts and capture the bookings.   I am grateful for all of your help in bringing in this deal.  It's a great win for the Mid-Market team and an amazing logo for Workhuman. As well as bringing former clients back to the Workhuman family.   THANK YOU\n\n154#Hiring@Workhuman|Thanks to a great group of gals for a great Hiring@Workhuman training session! I so appreciate your willingness to take the time out of your day to learn the best practices for interviewing at Workhuman. You were engaged, asked great questions, and made the session fun. I commend you for making the effort to ensure that any interviews you partake in will be effective and will provide a great experience to our candidates.\n\n155#Mapping the journey for Mapaex|Judith - Thank you for joining me on an extra early call this morning with Mapaex! This deal has been a difficult deal to navigate for a few different reasons, but you expertly commanded the launch call and ensured that we are doing everything we can to meet their ambitious goals for launching. You fielded questions like an absolute pro, and set up clear concrete expectations as to what needs to be done next in order to launch asap. Thanks for your help as always!\n\n156#Excellent Overview of Mid-Market|Judith, what an excellent job you did today briefing the executive team on our mid-market launch strategy.  The knowledge and expertise gained from 104 (104!!) launches clearly showed and your presentation and delivery were spot on.  We've been lucky to have you leading this effort the past few years and today was another clear reminder.  Some of the quotes from other executives included: \"You are the guru!\"; \"Fantastic work\"; and \"Amazing work!! And such a great update - thank you!\".  Well earned praise.  As our standard mid-market branding would say...Bravo!\n\n157#Prepare for launch|As I reflect upon the last 4 months and the start of my journey here at Workhuman, I am truly grateful to be part of such a supportive team.  During this time, I have been working on learning the process of launch and the philosophies of Workhuman while every person has welcomed me onto the team, answered all my questions and has been more than happy to share their expertise and friendship with me. This makes me feel truly humbled to be part of such an amazing group of people. Looking into next week our team will continue to grow and I can’t wait to help welcome them with open arms as you did me. Thank you for all you do!\n\n158#Viasat is Live!|The Stars program went live this week! After months of effort from everyone on this team, it feels like we're lifting off into space now that this launch is complete. Judith, thank you for watching my back on this one throughout all of the ups and downs on the project; your insights and strategies were invaluable. Brenda, just wow. All of the amazing suggestions that you made and experience you brought to the table helped these overthinkers to simplify their comms for a smooth roll-out. Sarah, your work on the branding was top-notch. The client actually teared up the first time they saw it, that's how much they love it! Robyn, thank you for sticking with us for the entirety of the launch and for speaking up about post-launch Stars life! Kelsey, your marketing campaign is gorgeous and well-thought out. This client can be demanding with their collateral requests, but you worked with Brenda to satisfy them! Last but not least, Maura and Dan, your support during this launch was incredible. From some initial scrambling to a long-tail launch, you've both helped us bring this one home.\n\n159#Stellar Internal & External Partnership|Congratulations on the launch of Viasat, Kat and Judith! This was my first launch in years and it was such a pleasure to partner back up with some LSM friends and do our thing together. So fun!!! From the start, I was thoroughly impressed, Kat, with how seasoned in the role you seemed. You managed this implementation like it was your 100th here. You had the messaging and tech down and it was obvious you were drawing on years of prior experience and good, old-fashioned work habits to manage the customer brilliantly. You were confident, decisive, professional, attentive, fun and a creative problem solver. And you managed the shadowing nuance adeptly, too. Shadowing scenarios can be tough for everyone involved, including the customer. They’re so hard to get right! Judith, you were masterful in your role! You and Kat seemed like a well-oiled machine. You respected her lead spot on the project while carving out a value-add role for yourself. The advice and wisdom you shared from your many years of recognition and WH-specific experience supplemented, not overshadowed, and progressed the work forward. No egos, no role confusion, no credibility eroded, just a symbiotic partnership, all in service to the customer…who fully respected (and liked - a critical factor!) you both.  This was most obvious to me during a budget conversation we had with Viasat a few months ago. You each contributed in different, and equally powerful, ways to get the customer headed in the right direction. I remember getting off that call thinking “Wow, these guys are GOOD!”  Lots of things went right with this launch, but for me the highlight was having a front row seat to all the partner-y goodness you delivered. It was a blast! Thank you for inspiring me with what great looks like!\n\n160#Amazing insights and knowledge sharing|Huge thank you Judith,  This week you were involved in several discovery sessions for me to understand the SMB/MM client base/segment. You were nothing short of amazing 😎. Your helpful insights and honesty really painted the picture about this Workhuman offering. My understand of the intricate pieces involved in launch and maintenance of these clients has improved a 1000 times over.  This was just world class knowledge sharing and I now have a huge appreciation for all that you and your colleagues do for Workhuman. I look forward to tackling some of the things we stand to improve upon for this segment.\n\n161#Introducing Kyndryl Checkpoint!!!|IBM has a new spin-off company, Kyndryl Inc. Kyndryl Checkpoint is the first of its kind.  We performed an entirely new customer setup, cloned conversations for the first time, migrated over 400K pieces of content from IBM to Kyndryl Checkpoint, updated branding and dynamic guidance in several languages. In addition, we guided the project team on best practices, new practices, turned on the help center guide, and coordinated the timing for Performance Improvement Plans and Year-End Reflections product initiatives. Your work was crucial in ensuring this launch was successful and that the new project team maintained confidence in Workhuman and our deliverability. A HUGE thank you for all the support and hard work completed these past six months. Congratulations, team, we did it!!!\n\n162#Q3 Mid-Market Success - breaking $1M|In July MM forecasted 600K (representing 60% of the value SMB closed 2020 and 2019)... Yesterday we had closed 700K, 9 New clients. 2 FULL WH Cloud deals. 3 Investing 1% of Payroll.  Then late last night we closed 1 more deal, 300K breaking the 1M barrier!   The list is long, please bear with me;  Judith, you are ALWAYS there when we need you!   Answering urgent questions, hoping on client calls, even helping us start design and program structure discussions while we worked through closing.  Let's not forget you bring all these clients to life!!!  Dave, the larger investments are all thanks to YOU! You relationship w/ Adriene heavily influenced our last win to close & invest 300K (for 300ee)!   Over the last year you've been a partner, challenge us to be better and grow.   Michael & Orlagh, we are continually coming to you as MANY of these customers require security assessments, risk questionnaires etc.   Julia and Emily, you've been patient and helped us win. We aim to minimize redlines to contracts, yet when needed you've been crucial to our success.     Julia last night you worked past 10pm to help us get this last deal done, which meant a lot to Lauren & I, as well as the whole team to hit this major milestone.   Jen your connections continue to pay off.  You are TRULY a fabric of the community.  Making intros, taking calls/meetings & setting us up for success.   Chris, Tom & Jason your continual support to our growth. At times there's tension as we negotiate these deals, securing pricing &terms we haven't historically extended.  That flexibility is giving us room to grow!  Dan there have been sandboxes, tech discussions and your help with our new demo site.   Ro demos and videos have helped us grow our CONV client base and differentiate us from the competition.   Andrew, Bash, Jamie & Erik you work every day has led to this success. Lauren you worked till the final hour pushing to bring deals in!  THANK YOU ALL!\n\n163#Selling is a team sport!|I wanted to thank the three of you for helping me bring Silfex on as a new member of the Workhuman family! You were instrumental in making this happen. Judith - you were willing to share as much as possible with our main contact to ensure we could move as quickly as possible. I appreciate you being flexible with this! Julia - you hopped on many calls with Sylvain and I to brainstorm, as well as calls with the Silfex legal and purchasing teams to ensure that we were all on the same page. Thank you! Sylvain - thank you for guiding me through one of my more complex sales cycles. Your ability to answer tough questions at a moments notice, as well as bring a confident and calm energy to every call is amazing, and helped me and the Silfex team feel confident navigating this process.\n\n164#So many little moments that matter|Judith - this past quarter has been a whole lot of fun and we aren't done yet! You've been amazing (per usual) at answering all my weird questions that may pop in a call to make sure I'm not selling something that isn't \"real.\" :) You helped me brainstorm ideas on how to integrate core values for one of my prospective customers and they've selected us as VOC! WOOO! You also stepped in to help out with MegaFoods to answer some of their implementation questions, so they can kickstart the process! I love our day-to-day chats about anything and everything. Most recently, that apple crisp recipe! Thanks for being an amazing support system and being so willing to lend a helping hand (even on Wednesdays... hehehe)\n\n165#The Ladies of Configapp - Umuc Elegibility issue|Thank you Simona and Judith for your amazing help to resolve the umuc elegibility issue  The client is claiming that people not eligible is receiving awards, after several try and many revert to production (there were a lot of other changes cannot be pushed live yet)  in config the issue was still present. You helped me to identify the issue despite you was in holidays (Simona) and your daily shift was finished (Judith) Your help has helped to avoid another waiting day to the client (was just waiting for a week) and you have demonstrate that \"making  work human\" is something absolutely real!!\n\n166#Reference Queen!|Judith - You are a wealth of knowledge when reference requests come through and are so thoughtful in your approach, carefully selecting the right customer based on the criteria. You never cease to amaze me with all the incredible relationships you've developed with customers. The quick response times and the common \"of course I would do a call for you!\" responses from customers are a testament to you delivering consistently incredible experiences. Thank you for your partnership and all you do for our customers!\n\n167#Mentorship|Judith, thanks for joining me on the Kyndryl journey. The winding roads of this launch have made me lean on your experience with complex customer issues. We had discussions on wording, meeting strategy, and test scenarios. Not to mention that it was your idea to have the Kyndryl team test in PRE PROD since they needed to validate the scalability of the migration. In addition, you hopped on several Kyndryl calls and helped me rethink and revise the launch project plan. Having you on my mentor during this launch is a precious gift. The lessons you've taught me thus far will remain with me forever.  Thank you!\n\n168#Always taking the time to answer a question|Hi Guys,  Thank you for taking the time to steer me in the right direction when I encounter something I have not done before.   It's never easy starting a new role and starting one remotely really is a challenge but you always make sure I have the right information I need before reaching out to a customer.  Thanks again folks your help is always very much appreciated.\n\n169#The Spotlight's on You!|Judith, where do I even begin? I'll start almost 14 months ago when we kicked off with the MassMutual team for their program expansion from a pilot group to a company-wide rollout including the Celebrations bundle! Given their pilot was live for several years, we probably should have known then it was going to be a long-haul effort to get them live. Fast forward many months, calls, integrations, email edits, test scripts, go-live date changes, several program names, SSO challenges, multiple icons & images and everything in between that you were managing behind the scenes, and Spotlight finally went live this week! Judith, you remained patient and pleasant throughout the entire launch, never letting the delays or changes distract you from the end goal. The MassMutual team was incredibly lucky to have you as their implementation partner during this time. Although my role was untraditional during this launch, I also consider myself lucky to have been a fly on the wall and learn about their business and their methodical approach to launch. Mostly though, I was lucky to witness once again what a genuinely wonderful human you are, and how much you care about helping customers make good decisions that set them up for long-term success. Katie’s (one of MM's two project managers) email on launch day says it all “Thank you for your guidance, flexibility and patience as we navigated the twists and turns of this project!  May Judith never have to edit another social recognition email alert message!” Congrats on another fantastic launch , Judith, and thank you for letting me tag along!\n\n170#Valuable Feedback|I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for taking the time to join my Roundtable session to introduce yourselves and spend sometime providing me with helpful context and feedback about your time at Workhuman - everything you shared was very helpful for me learning the business and looking for areas to quickly add value. I so look forward to our continued partnership!\n\n171#Kyndryl/IBM Migration Gut Check Time|Sometimes along the journey to the top of the mountain, we hit a challenge all need to do a gut check and confirm that we can make it.  This was that week on Kyndryl and IBM.  We needed to work through planning, testing issues and customer concerns.  It was challenging, no doubt about it.  You all rose to the occasion! Patrick, you are the human in the front and your mettle is being tested.  You've kept your calm, pivoted and have kept us all moving forward.  Kel, you've shown that you can go deep on the planning, working with many internal stakeholders and shown accountability to the customer.  And Judith, you've been keeping an eye on the technical aspects of our test plan and are making sure we are indeed on the right path.  There are more steps needed to get us to the top of the mountain, but we WILL get there with all of your support.  We recognize and appreciate it.  Keep on!\n\n172#Information Sharing  - impromptu trainings|Judith has been a great partner proactively reaching out when she was working on processes that I need more exposure to. During these impromptu training sessions, we reviewed configuration and data files. She was able to share tips and best practices of things that caused delays in the past.  This week she also reached out when the team was asked about a new software program that I was unfamiliar with. During this quick check in demonstrated how the software was used and best practices on how it fits into the Launch workflow. Thank you for being a great partner and sharing your expertise.\n\n173#Above and Beyond!|Judith! I can't begin to thank you enough for all of the help and kindness you have shown me lately. You have gone out of your way to help show me how to do specific things for customers that are no longer yours to work with as well as help me with questions I have just in general. You are always willing to jump on a quick call or help out and I am so thankful for that!! I really appreciate it!\n\n174#Points Balance Help!|Thank You Liz and Judith  for helping me keep up to date the points balance for CSM's Mid-Market clients.  I was covering Mick during his holidays for this task, your help with the clients for whom I haven't the balance visibility was an incredible help to keep the CSM team updated.  Thank you so much!\n\n175#Going for the Gold!|Team, I want to thank each of you for participating in today's quick lunch time brainstorming session.  We know the amount of hard work, dedication, and finesse that is required of our team day in and day out.  Everyone shows up to win everyday and it is evident with the recent stellar feedback we have been getting directly from customers.  I really appreciate everyone's time and focus in our meeting today.  This session was just one of many, as we look to constantly fine tune and improve the launch process. I truly value everyone's input and I look forward to future productive sessions.\n\n176#Knowledge Sharing|Thank you for presenting at this weeks Customer Success All Hands meeting! Kylie, Sophia and Rachel - the stories you shared about how you are each working with your customers on DEI initiatives brought helpful insight that allows the broader team to think about DEI opportunities at other customers. Nick, Matt and Judith - Congrats to each of you on your recent launches and thank you for sharing your learnings with the broader team!\n\n177#Kemper Insurance Ready to Roll|Judith thanks for your outstanding work on the getting Kemper Insurance program live.  What a journey it has been since they signed back in Sept 2019.  COVID hit so that was the first delay, new CHRO meant another delay to evaluate and then one by one the HR team that were involved with the project from the beginning left the organization then lastly min-commit challenges.  But through all this you kept the project moving along, communicated with me where they were in the process and finally this week they went live.  I knew they were in great hands with you.  I appreciate your great work and patience of getting them live. Great work!\n\n178#Kemper is live after 627 days|Judith, I really enjoy working with you. But 627 days on a launch is a bit much. LOL. Kemper's Exec Sponsor was a previous WH customer and super excited to launch within 6 weeks! That was back in 2019. Unfortunately, they had to re-convene on budget which took us offline for 6 months. When we re-engaged, we had a new team. We'd end up having 4 (or 5?) Exec Sponsors, 6 Program Managers, and 5 Communications teams during these 20 months. We'd have to restart with each new team and bring them up to speed. But amazingly, they are live because you hung in there and got them to test and even get us a production data file. They've had 180 awards and had over 1,100 managers attend training sessions. Congrats on another launch!\n\n179#A Well-Deserved Thank You from Douglas Elementary!|Kevin and Judith, thank you for your tremendous leadership partnering with Douglas Elementary to deliver our very first schools pilot!  Jenna at Douglas asked me to share the following thank you with you both:  \"Kevin, thank you for working with Chris and I through the roll out and initial phases.  We really appreciate Workhuman reaching out to the public-school sector.\"  and \"Judith, Thank you for your patience and assistance with the technical glitches.  You are always so nice and accommodating when I ask for help.\"  This is such an exciting first step into a new and very meaningful category of customer!  I am beyond excited to see this area of our business evolve and grow in the weeks, months, and years to come!  Well done!\n\n180#Awesome Teamwork!!!|I just wanted to give a big shout to Judith for being so helpful and kind on a troubleshooting event with a new launch!  Thank you for being an awesome human!\n\n181#Fountain of knowledge|Judith, thanks very much for fielding many questions in relation to YoS physical packs last week, we are in the middle of launching physical packs for a new client. You were looped into a random teams discussion on this topic, thanks for taking the time to come back on that. I am new to physical packs, so I really appreciate the information share and the insight you provided me from the CSM side. You're a great team mate.\n\n182#There when we needed you|Judith, I wanted to thank you for stepping in on an email chain with answers to a query we were having - I truly appreciate the knowledge you were able to provide and the insight on the situation. Thank you so much for your help and immediate responsiveness.\n\n183#Quite the *learning* journey!|Team, I can't thank you all enough for your efforts throughout this deal! Thank you, Orlagh and Michael, for a speedy response with the security assessment, really made the process easy for our new customer. Sylvain, I can't thank you enough for the endless hours you put in, from sending contract emails at 9 pm to contract and pricing negotiations. Coursera came back with a mediocre investment level after discussing best practices. You provided instant value by shifting their thought about what a healthy investment looked like and doubled the deal size!! Thank you, Chris, for helping out with the financial side of the deal by providing us with a strong incentive that helped us push this through the finish line. Judith, thank you for scheduling times with us to discuss customer handoff as we waited for the contract. The Coursera team is excited to get the ball rolling and get their new recognition program live! Legal... I don't even know where to begin. I must say, Coursera was a tough cookie to crack, but you stayed persistent and adamant about holding the line on our MSA. Every time we thought we agreed on terms, they would come back with yet, another red line. You were instrumental in this whole process. Without you, we wouldn't be here celebrating this amazing win! I learned so much from this sales process, and it took me through a rollercoaster of emotions. Coursera wasn't lying when they say they are in the business of teaching others. I'm incredibly grateful for all of you, and I look forward to many more wins as a team!\n\n184#Less than a week...|It wasn't ideal when Premier Research gave us less than a week (5 business days) to turn around their very lengthy and thorough RFI. But with this team, we were able to get it done and submitted! Michael, we knew the RFI was coming but weren't privy to how extensive the questions were going to be, but you jumped right in and started working on it! You worked quickly and efficiently to answer all their questions, so you could return a rough draft to me on Friday afternoon!  Judith, thank you for taking a look at the RFI and pointing out Mid Market differentiators (Client services, Award amounts, etc.)! Sylvain, thanks for moving calls, helping me craft an executive summary, list out our pricing (with the help of Bruno), and answering all my one-off questions (can we do this? can I delete that?)! Last but not least, Anna thanks for helping put this together and preparing it to send off to Premier Research! It takes a village to get these requests done and I'm so thankful for all of your support at the last minute!\n\n185#We know that WE know!|Team, thank you so much for your participation and knowledge sharing at our training this week. There is so much that we can learn together as we grow as a team to create solid process, resources and guidance on the way we interact with our customers. Special thanks to those in the group that lent their voices and expertise to the training to further refine and enhance the experience for all. Now we can say that WE know!!\n\n186#Teamwork on General Dynamics!|Judith, thank you so much for your help today during our General Dynamics call. We started out in a tough place with their pre-existing expectations around physical Years of Service awards. You jumped right in to help explain some of the options, and shared some anecdotes based on your experiences with other clients. This helped them to understand the universe of what's possible, and could help shift their thinking to a more modern and employee-centric approach. I very much appreciate you bringing your expertise to this meeting!\n\n187#Midmarket reference rockstar|Judith - I want to say thank you for being an incredible partner on Midmarket references. You've developed such fantastic, long-lasting relationships with these customers and have a command of their challenges and successes. These customers respond so quickly and with enthusiasm to share their experience working with us, it's clear you deliver white-glove service each time you're launching a new customer and continue to cultivate your relationship with them over time. Thank you for being such a great partner to me and to the customers you work with - you rock!\n\n188#Showcasing Workhuman for P&G|Thank you so much for jumping into the P&G cloned site project for P&G’s RFP. Becky came up with a creative idea to create a cloned POY site to showcase the power of the WH Cloud and have the P&G team fully emerged in the experience we provide. This team jumped into action to set the foundation for P&G to experience the next generation of the Power of You. Judith – thank you for being my partner in crime on this project. We created multiple programs, 20+ new awards and 20+ new award reasons, streamlining Timelines approach, enabling new functionality, did our own QA testing and troubleshooting. Our collaboration allowed us to get through the multiple layers of the site set up. Lucas - part of the project included a refresh of the branding on the home page and inner pages.  You made it really hard to choose which mockup version to go with. Once we finalized the choice, we reused your mockup work for the inner page images. You really captured a fresh, updated look for P&G. Ihar – great job executing on the implementation of Lucas’ vision, and our tweaks along the way. You both were instrumental with your quick turnaround times to keep to the timeline. Claire – thank you for helping Judith and I QA the site. Your review with an eye on the existing program was very helpful, along with pointing out production only configurations. Kate, Paul, Maxsim, Stephen – your attention to the Jira tickets and understanding the urgency was key in the project and so appreciated. Thank you for your partnership in this project … to put Workhuman in the best light to showcase who we are and to support a long time customer, P&G!\n\n189#Thank you!|Colleagues, thank you so much for your time. I wish to recognize your contribution to help us improve on our understanding of the different processes and tool navigation (Spend management) in your areas of expertise. This has enhanced our knowledge in areas like billing, Invoicing etc. something we're really grateful for. You're the true champions of quality improvement in as far as we're concerned.\n\n190#You ARE the Brains of our Operation!!!|Judith this is LONG overdue!   The MEME may be funny, but it's true!  We've had an incredibly busy 9 months in Mid Market.  Just this past quarter we've signed 5 new customers and had over 100 meetings!   I'm continually pinging you with questions of \"can we do this\"... \"what if we approach it this way\"....   You've also been incredibly helpful in how we improve our presentations to prospects, the functionality on our demo site and are now leading me through the motions of having our demo site rebranded (which will mean a fresh modern look for all our new Mid Market customers who opt out of custom branding).   Over all this leads to our success in Mid Market, I truly appreciate all you do, your continued partnership and your responsiveness!\n\n191#It's more than a crystal ball|You are doing more over there than just reading a crystal ball. Your knowledge of the config app and tools are b-e-y-o-n-d amazing. Sometimes I just call and ask you to explain something to me or can this be done...type of thing and your wealth of knowledge immediately kicks in. Today, Western Digital thanks you for a legacy setting that complicated notifications. Thanks for always being there for my questions and 'why's' (that have been around since I was 2 years old).\n\n192#Appreciate your help!|Judith!   Thank you so much for helping me with the questions I have had the past couple of days. You are always one of the first to respond in the CS Questions slack channel and went out of your way to walk me through the issues I had at the end of the day yesterday and into this morning! Thanks for being a team player and helping me navigate and find the right resources!!\n\n193#Western Digital Assist|Judith - I wanted to take a moment to say a huge thank you for all your help testing Western Digital last week. We were down to the wire with testing, with approval rules and eligibility rules not working as expected. You volunteered to help navigate the test scenarios I had created and sanity check all the work we'd done to make sure the client was ready to put into UAT that night. It may not have seemed like that much, but the small issues we caught made such a big difference from a first impression perspective and having a second set of eyes to review the work helped me so much!! Thank you for jumping in!!!\n\n194#Douglas Elementary School Pilot - Time to Learn!|We're about to embark on an exciting journey for our Beyond the Workplace ambitions.  Thank you to all of you for your efforts in getting us here and your future efforts in making this a successful test pilot.  This opportunity with Douglas Elementary School began due to incredible heart and passion of you Alice.  You saw a school system in need of appreciation and inclusion and opened the doors given your personal connections into it. From there, we started to assemble the dream team, Cam, Lynette, and Judith who will undoubtedly make this pilot a success (of learnings, strategic insight, and infused positivity).  And Hillary - masterful job on streamlining the contract, as this is quite new for both parties and the aim was to make the agreement as frictionless as possible. Thank you also to Lauren, Amy, and Jim for their leadership and support along the way.  Now it's time to get in the classroom and start our learnings!\n\n195#Appreciating You!|Customer Success Teams thank you for the amazing work that you do for our customers everyday! We wanted to take a moment on Employee Appreciation Day to appreciate all of you for your truly impactful work. Even in the remote world that we’ve all been in over the past year you haven’t missed a beat and continue to change the world through how you engage with our customers and other internal colleagues. As we strive to bring recognition to the global workplace you are all making an impact through your efforts, activities and thoughtful interactions. From, Jay, Jose, Danielle, Michelle and Amy\n\n196#Great feedback from LogMeIn|Judith, You have done a great job on the LogMeIn launch. They were a mid-market (previously known as SMB) customer who wanted to launch to the rest of their enterprise. You guided their existing program managers and new program managers through this transition so smoothly. I love this customer and will miss working with you on it. Here is feedback directly from Christine at LogMeIn who asked me to recognize you through Spark:  \"Judith, thank you for an incredibly successful launch of our new Bravo program! You were absolutely fantastic to work with on this project and faced challenges head on with a smile – even right up on launch day with changes to our logic 😊 We could not have made it over the finish line without you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! \"\n\n197#LLA is Launched!|Judith - I think the launch with Liberty Latin America has taken well over a year at this point. In fact, I think our conversations with them have been at least for 2+ years. You were able to leverage your trusted advisor status with some of their legacy programs like Liberty PR and guide them through their many, many branding challenges. I've never witnessed a client go through so many homepage designs or focus so specifically on the award certificate. Regardless of the challenge or how many times you were asked the same question, you confidently guided and focused their attention on what needed to get down. And you maintained your patience regardless of the scenario or problem, which can be tough with so many different voices chiming in on their calls. I know it took a long time coming, but cheers to getting this important global telecomms client live! They are interested in bringing in adding more budget and turning on points down the line, and I know it's great to have a client with such a strong LatAm presence in our portfolio.\n\n198#Zoom around Tues night|Thanks everyone for showing up and contributing to a warm, fun and insightful zoom-around on Tuesday.  Not the same as an in-person conversation, of course but i really enjoyed spending some work-free time with you.  I hope you enjoyed listening and contributing to the 2 lies and 1 truth game we played .... never ceases to amaze me what stories we all have to tell and share.\n\n199#LogMeIn star|Judith - I wanted to recognize the great job you have done on the launch/expansion for LogMeIn! You were tasked with taking a very well used sales program and successfully incorporating that into a global Recognition expansion. After months of back and forth between the sales program PM, the new PMs, every HRIS and SSO resource they had to offer, we were able to create an amazing program that satisfied all their needs. Of course like any great launch they dropped a bomb right before go live, letting us know the company values were changing and in turn so were the award reasons. You quickly got to work on a solution to provide access back to the sales program - working internally and externally to hit an important deadline. You also had the added complexity of merging accounts and getting previous awards over to the new program. Through it all you were a confident and positive resource for LMI. Although it has had its challenges, this launch has been a ton of fun and I am looking forward to seeing your hard work come to life in a few weeks!\n\n200#Natgasoline SOLI Table|Hi Judith!  Thank you very much for taking time to help us today with the SOLI table for this client. We had a big issue to solve since some employees have not received their YOS and we needed to fix the problem in config, push it live and do a Wbau as soon as possible for them. We could do it all in time because you have helped us to figure out how to solve the problem with their SOLI table that was failing.   Thank you very much for that!  Tay\n\n201#Ready, Steady and Launch!!!!|To Amy, Rich, Shawn, Dan, Liz, Nick, Judith, Matt Carroll and Matt Gillen.  I wanted to recognise each and everyone of you for all the work that you all have put into the Weekly Launch Meetings with our team each Wednesday. I have been hosting these for a few weeks now and have been supremely impressed at the level of quality you deliver and excellent updates you provide each week. You all take the time each week to keep us informed on any urgent request, upcoming QA/UAT weeks, any autobau or wbaus on launch. I can go on and on!! Dan you provide the weekly spreadsheet each week to help us navigate the upcoming launches. Amy as every you offer such great leadership and guidance on launches. There has been so many clients this year we have all worked on. Even in the last number of weeks. Shawn you have managed Christiana Care,NCR and the exciting IBM project. Rich with the recent launch of Cytiva, State Street and Aviva. Judith you had Resource REIT, LLA, Moderna. Liz you have Manulife, Takeda and the new project for J&J. Nick with Nordson, Bobcat and now Cree. Matt C with 3D Systems, Amadeus and Snyopys. Matt G with P&G earlier in the year and now Health First and Edgewell. You all do such an amazing job in leading these launches. Congrats to each of you on every success this year and to many more perfect launches. Awesome work everyone :D if ever a team deserved a Workhuman Ring The Gong Trophy it is the launch team!!!!\n\n202#\"Any Time!\"|Judith - thank you so much for all your help these past few weeks, especially around Nordson! You've truly gone above and beyond in helping me with my questions, as we've chatted on Friday nights, a Saturday on Slack, and in the early mornings. Thank you for your calm and knowledgeable approach, where you truly dive deep into the problems and investigate every angle. Even though you've been so busy, you've made time to help me and hop on the phone. It is much appreciated!\n\n203#Holding the MidMarket Fort Down|I want to thank you all very much for the support and assistance while I have been on paternity leave with existing & future customers.  My life has been flipped upside down (in a good way!) but I know my team has my back on the work side if things.  Thanks a ton!!!\n\n204#We did it!!!!|It takes a village and I have to say.... MY VILLAGE IS THE BEST!! Thanks to all of you, we're able to bring on our newest Mid Market customer, CROMA! Jamie thank you so much for fielding the initial demo request, asking great questions on the discovery and setting me up for success to demo to Andreas! Hari, you have been my rock all along. Helping answer difficult questions, making CROMA feel at ease implementing our solution, hopping on a call late at night with their IT Resource to field his concerns, and overall providing your unwavering support. Judith - the amount of times I've slacked you RIDICULOUS questions is too many to count. Thank you for always being there to answer my questions and also help me speak to how our partnership transitions once they become a customer. Last but definitely not least... Sylvain, you were a HUGE part of bringing CROMA on board as a customer.  Your guidance truly helped me win this deal. We strategized on how to win this deal by diving deeper into the logistics of the SHIRE program that they previously used and loved, bringing in the right resources at the right time, deciding when I should take calls 1:1 to build rapport, negotiating contract terms with ease, and most importantly always being there when I needed advice (or a good laugh)! Thanks to this team we brought on another Workhuman Customer! Let's go get another :)\n\n205#Super Team|Thanks to all of you for working incredible dedicated towards resolving an delayed/last minute subscription payment submitted by client Alnylam. Client program was once again switched Live today due to all of you doing what needed to be done by communicating & working together as a team after we received an urgent call from client Tuesday afternoon. Also in addition an order of USD 1,600,000 was requested by client and has been submitted for client attention , You All Rock, SJ\n\n206#CAA and Echelon success|Judith and Sylvain, thank you for your help ensuring Echelon had enough points to recognize all of their employees. I received an email on short notice from the PM at CAA & Echelon that they wanted to recognize all of their employees and you both quickly jumped in to help. Thanks for contributing to the 'Season of Giving' , Workhuman style!\n\n207#Helping hand w/ Echelon Insurance|Christie and Judith, thank you both for your help on Echelon insurances recent order of points.  It was URGENT for them to get these purchased and into their system ASAP for WBAU coming from their CEO.   With Mike out on Paternity leave this was my first point purchase and we had to work quickly.   You both stepped up to help me out, guiding me and responding quickly to my requests!   Thanks for making this a success for Echelon!\n\n208#Success at RTI!|Judith & Michael - it's been a pleasure working with you to launch RTI. Judith - this hasn't been an easy one! This truly global launch presented many challenges, from unique CIL countries to intense graduated pricing conversations. You handled it all like the pro you are - calm and collected. Your deep knowledge of the site capabilities was evident all the way through. You also built strong relationships with the team, even though it was hard at times. They felt supported and heard. Thanks for being such a great partner! Michael - the team is in great hands! You've stepped in to ensure a smooth transition and it's clear that the program manager and exec sponsor are comfortable and excited to hit their goals, with your support. Cheers to another successful launch!\n\n209#Mid-Market Demo Success!|Thank you team for making today's Mid-Market Demo the most successful demo to date!  We doubled the registrations from last event (69) and almost doubled the attendance of the last two events combined(29)!!!!  Hence the Mighty Mouse reference, we may be a smaller team but we are mighty!  It was no easy feat to accomplish in a short matter of time and you all played a vital role!  Securing a customer to speak,  updating landing pages, creating Linked In Elevate Posts, pushing out invites, following up on said invites, driving attendance and so many more steps I am most likely forgetting!!!    THANK YOU!\n\n210#The 1-2 Life Events Punch|What a week you’ve had! A double Life Events launch for 2 SMB customers. First, was SECU, who is the first SMB to launch recognition and the free Life Events version.  But wait there’s more! They plan to move to paying LE after the free period is up and when redoing the Order Form for LE, they also extended the contract for a third year!  And the second instance for adding LE was for Tracelink, who just launched a month ago. They too plan to move to being a paying LE customer next year. Talk about selling skills on the benefits of Life Events! Congrats on both big moments!\n\n211#Securing a reference-able customer|Judith I was actively working to secure a customer to join our Oct 15th webinar.  No easy feat as we haven't always maintained the best relationships with our Mid-Market customers.  After I reached out to two customers you offered to provide some air coverage and reach out.  You jokingly shared they would respond faster to you... well you were RIGHT!  They did and it helped us secure Jennifer for our meeting next week.   Your relationships with our customers matter,  THANK YOU!\n\n212#Hey, I have another question.....|Judith, you have been a lifesaver!!! Over the past month, you have dedicated time to help me get up to speed on all things Mid-Market! We've spent countless hours on 1:1's, doing demos together, too many slacks to count, and that one phone call you took while on your way out the door to help me complete an RFP due in an hour :)! Learning the ins and outs of Mid Market vs. Corporate has been a huge learning curve but you have made it that much easier! I also appreciate how supportive you have been on the days where I'm feeling like I haven't progressed fast enough. Always offering words of encouragement and putting the journey into perspective. Thank you for all of the insights, knowledge, experience, and passion you have for the Mid Market Team!

Thanks a million and I look forward to our continued partnership!\n\n213#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt in the first week of go-live to make sure we have all your important information correct!\n\n214#Lattice Work|Judith, thank you very much for helping prepare the sandbox for Lattice Semiconductor.  This was a first for mid market, and certainly helped their confidence level with our delivery in China.  Michael, thank you very much for quickly supplying our global populations to once again ensure to the prospect we have them covered globally.  Thanks again!\n\n215#VP of HR Request After Hours Friday|Judith I was in a panic as I get an email from a client of mine at 4:45 cst Friday afternoon late (which is 5:45 your time) asking for help as their CFO was having issues trying to reward some of their staff. I was like who can I reach out to that late on a Friday that will respond and help me get some support.... Judith!   Within 15 minutes you had responded back to me after a few phone calls that our Customer Service team will be reaching out to her via email with help.  You made me and Workhuman look good as I was going back and forth with her till 8:30 that night letting her know we are working on getting it solved.  I appreciate your effort and responsiveness even though it was not your responsibility....I knew you would help if you could.   Thanks for being you!\n\n216#You understood my \"points of view\"(see what I did)|Judith,  Thank you so much for your help yesterday in ensuring one of our clients had the Points View functionality added to their program.  It will be extremely beneficial to them and the quick turn around will be much appreciated.  Appreciate the support on this one!\n\n217#Launch after Launch, Success after Success|Everyone, I want to thank you all so much for the incredible hard work, determination, sometimes long hours and fantastic success you constantly bring to every launch you all work on to make these all a huge success.  Amy, I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing leadership you show with your team. Anytime we have worked together on launches. You are instrumental in the phenomenal success that we have with each of our launches.  Liz, You had one of the biggest launches of the year with Pepsi. I know first hand how much brilliant work that you put into getting clients to launch. It was inspiring and you set the standards for dedication and hard work. There were other launches this year in Santander, Corteva and Plantronics.  Rich, With one of the other major launch success stories this year in Astrazeneca. In particular, noting the incredibly complex drools rules. Not only AZ but you were key to some other great launches with State Street, Aviva, LAM Research and Sabre. Shawn, The experience you show on launches is mind blowing. We worked on a few success stories in Stepan Company and EMC Insurance, NCR Corporation. As well as upcoming launches like Day & Ross.  Matt Gillen, I can note the incredible work you did on Manulife and UCB. You managed these so well and I am sure the upcoming launch of Avangrid will be another success story.  Matt Carroll, We have worked together on some great launches. Omnitracs & Emerson were both fantastic launches. There are also some exciting upcoming launches that you are involved with like Teknor Apex. Judith, Working together on launches, you always stun me with the unbelievable level of quality you put into these launches.  There are so many launches with your name on it: Liberty Latin America and so many upcoming launches like LivaNova, RTI and Tracelink.   Nicholas, I have been so impressed to see the great work you are doing with both the launches of PTC and Gundersen. I'm sure these will be great client launches.\n\n218#Mid Market Growth Mindset|In Carol Dweck's GROWTH MINDSET, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.  People who embrace growth mindsets—the belief that they can become smarter if they work hard and persevere—may learn more and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve and grow.  Over the last 8 weeks you've ALL demonstrated a Growth Mindset.  The ability for us to succeed in the Mid Market territory is directly related to us adapting and improving on our approaches.   Jamie, I've asked more of you, creating meetings in real time, improving discovery discussions and proactively targeting specific prospects.  Every time we've asked or changed something you rise to the occasion with a positive mindset and deliver!  Thank you!  Mike,  I shared that with \"great power comes great responsibility\", as the company invests in us, they will also look to see the results.  We've increased the number of meetings and our pipeline. We're adapting the territories, workload and ways we engage with prospects to better suit a proactive hunter approach.  You've rolled with the punches, I promise you that continuing to do so will deliver results!  Dave, I've leaned on you quite a bit!  You're engaged in many more meetings,  at times with less info and background than we're accustomed to.   You've taken it in good stride and always work to deliver the best outcomes.  During my PTO you took the lead on our POD call, as well as on several customer facing opportunities.  Love the partnership and your desire to help us grow this business.   Erik & Judith, your experience here at Workhuman has been vital to my learning curve in this new segment.  Working with us on new ideas to approach the market, sharing your insights with the team.   Thank you!\n\n219#Thanks for helping me move the furniture (images)|Judith, thank you so much for helping me with OTIS' site branding yesterday. Their site is from the SMB model of sites and in need of some updates to say the least.  I messaged you with some questions about the branding for their My Team page and mentioned I noticed their old parent company's logo on their printable certificate. In true Judith fashion you jumped in to config and found where that logo lives, worked your magic and updated it within minutes. What could have taken a couple of days for the branding team to fix you were innovative and MacGyver'd your way through it in minutes. Thank you for jumping in to help me!\n\n220#Teaching us the ways of the LSM Jedi!|Judith, thank you so much for your time this week on the customer marketing team call. It was so eye opening to hear the 'not so day in the life' of an LSM. You are all Jedi masters! Hearing about the process of launch, peaks and sometimes pits and how you folks partner together with other team members was so fascinating! We all feel so much more educated because of the time. Thanks for begins so generous with your schedule and we hope to have you on another call again soon. Really appreciate you being such a great teammate!\n\n221#MASSively grateful for getting this started|Melissa and Judith, I am so impressed each time we have a call with MassMutual! I am really grateful that you were both assigned to this exciting launch! MassMutual knows what they want and have more questions than most of my clients and you both address their questions and concerns with ease. You both came prepared for their kick off call with little time between the call and when their contract was signed. I know Mass Mutual is equally impressed and value  both of you for your knowledge, insight, and ability to connect. I am excited to continue with this project with you two!\n\n222#RTI - IM rule change|Thanks Judith for all your help and information on a recent issue for one of our clients RTI with a recent dataload issue with the isle of man country. You are always on hand to help out and give assistance when needed 🙂 Thank You 😁\n\n223#Always present, Always Great!|I would like to say thank you Judith because You are always present to help me when I am looking for your help (you have been extremely kind to organize a call only for me to explain me the Point purchasing process)  and even when I made a mistake and you proactively helped me to understand (the YOS email notification issue).  Thank you so much Judith, you rock!\n\n224#LogMeWin Team|What a team! I want to thank each of you for the fantastic role you played in winning the new LogMeIn business. LogMeIn started with Workhuman in early 2017 as a spiff tool for a small group of sales reps and is now signed on to launch a full peer to peer recognition program for all 4000+ employees in 13 countries. There were many small wins along the way that ultimately gave the CEO at LogMeIn the confidence to execute this new contract earlier this week.   John, you were a guiding force during the last two months, and we couldn’t have won this business without your leadership.  Hillary, you showed tremendous knowledge, speed, and creativity working the order forms and MSA. You were able to convert the first SMB to corporate using an “amendment.”  Corinne, your ROI investment discussions with Beth Salamida back in the summer of 2017 were vital in building the foundation of our relationship with the LogMeIn HR team. Beth was able to answer the CEO’s final questions this week.  Orlagh and Michael, you lifted and completed that SIG heavy like it was nothing!  Jamie, you were able to continually make Beth feel special over the last three years with holiday gift baskets, cookies, and tremendous follow up.  Bashir, you were essential in reviving this opportunity earlier this Spring.  Judith, Rachel, and Amy thank you for helping us think through all of the nuances that are involved with going from SMB to corporate. I have a feeling we will be having more conversations about this going forward.  Chris, thank you and your Sam Adams bottle for giving us a transaction fee that worked for both sides!   Mike, you pushed for an executive alignment call and executed it perfectly, which lead to us closing the deal with time to spare!  Thank you all so much!\n\n225#Thanks|Judith, thanks for hopping on the call with me yesterday when I needed your assistance with one of our clients. I had no idea you had a day off when I initiated the chat, and yet despite my insistence that you enjoy your day off, you would not take no for an answer. That was a high-level exhibition of the 'urgency' value, thanks so much.  Talk about feeding the good wolf! this award is well deserved.\n\n226#Queens of Cool|Judith and Cliona,  I have to call-out your collective cool and patience with the longest branding process that I've ever experienced (to remain unnamed but you know who I'm talking about!) We're dealing with a lot of cooks in the kitchen, they're not shy about sharing their opinions and it takes them a long time to understand the limitations of what they're able to change. Judith, no matter how many times they repeated the same question and asked for the impossible, you politely addressed their concerns, and re-focused them on the possible, while providing clear explanations along the way. Cliona - you've gone above and beyond to have phone calls with this client to receive feedback, and you stay on top of their slow responses to things. I also appreciate how patient you were in the minute changes they were fixated on (such as button size), making them feel that their branding requests were being heard. This client clearly values their brand identity, and I wanted to acknowledge your herculean and professional efforts in satisfying them. Thank you for being the Queens of Cool in all your client interactions!\n\n227#SpendMeIn|Thank you all for your help and guidance navigating the spend management system that LogMeIn has today versus what they could do in our corporate platform. The sales and care team at LogMeIn were concerned that they would not be able to replicate what they are doing today. Each of you was able to add different insights that made them feel comfortable that they would not be losing any functionality. Thanks again, and I appreciate the speed and effort you put into this.\n\n228#Thanks for Sandbox help!|Judith, Several of us on my team have been having trouble accessing Sandbox and it's been a big pain point because we often need to grab screenshots, check something for a customer, etc. You gave us several tips to have helped you and they have already helped 2 of my team members successfully access Sandbox today. Thank you for thinking of us.\n\n229#Reply is always: HAPPY TO HELP!!|JUDITH!!! #Happytohelp #Callme #Skypeme #Zoomwithme. It's Friday afternoon and I'm in search of some technical expertise. Who's immediately available and can be pestered to help? Who will know the answers? Who has done with more than most - yes, Judith!! I ping you out of the blue with a 'do you have 10 minutes for me today?' You immediately came back with yes, free now and happy to help!! You jumped right in, dropped your own work, helped me think through how to articulate to Pepsi's comms team, in a visual way, what a Service Milestones program with a 'legacy program blackout period' could look like, July 1st - August 3rd and then August 4th - 25th various gap times and then full experience. It was a lot to understand on a Friday afternoon. You helped me with the dates, visual diagram, even reviewed a communications piece! If that wasn't enough for one day, an hour later found myself again needing some assistance when attempting to get into sandbox and only getting error messages. You graciously grabbed a screen shot of P&G's Power of You home page to be inserted into a deck for Kevin Dalton to hopefully win senior leaders over and turn on Life Events! A critical screen shot to show what the experience will look/feel like at P&G. I truly appreciated the above and beyond effort, sense of urgency and your expertise to advance some of our largest customer initiatives! It's not often we get to work together and when we do it reminds me of how lucky we are to have you as a colleague and friend! You rock!!\n\n230#Resource America WBAU Issue|Thank you Judith for all you efforts, knowledge and Help, of course, to solve this very complicated issue with client's points balance at my first time facing with WBAU process I learned a lot from you! Thank you again!\n\n231#Grateful for Partnership|Judith and Shawn - I am lucky to be working on 2 launches with each of you. You have been the ultimate partners during this time and I am so appreciative. Judith - from difficult conversations about fair market value to deeply personal conversations, you've made our clients (and myself) feel so supported during this time. Your friendly voice coupled with your wealth of knowledge put our clients at ease. Shawn - thank you for being a solid cheerleader for me through this crazy time. You called me a \"boss mom\" out of the blue the other day when I needed to hear that more than anything. You are such a wonderful partner for me and our clients. It's clear how much clients both like and respect you, which is not always the easiest thing to achieve. Ladies - cheers to you and THANK YOU for everything.\n\n232#Thank You Healthcare Images - Weekend Worriors|Thank you all for jumping in to take part in the logo and image sourcing and uploading for hospitals into the Thank You Healthcare site!  Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring! Thank you also to each of you who dedicated an hour, several hours and in some cases most of the weekend to sourcing and uploading!  We so appreciate your efforts!  Many hands make light work, my mother used to say! I do want to call out a few of you who really made an incredible dent in the project uploading and sourcing between 70 and 230 images each and in many cases hitting both uploading and sourcing!  WOW!  Brian Moore, Matt Durgin, John Wamback, Jon Bizeur, Amanda Salvas, Rich Sorrentino, Jillian Gregoriou and Dan Fiore, you guys are complete rock stars and your contributions were mammoth! This was a true team effort and to see it in action makes me so proud to be a part of our Workhuman family!  Amazing job! Let’s share some gratitude with the world now!\n\n233#Resilience all around|This team never ceases to amaze me. Your usual day-to-day launch lives have been completely turned upside down and then sideways, and in some cases upside down again. With a mix of customers still moving forward with on target launches and some delaying due to COVID19, you’ve been learning to adapt and adjust. You’ve gone from sprinting to learning how to jog and in the world of LSMs, that simply is not close to being easy. I wanted to acknowledge your resilience over the past month. The weeks ahead will bring the next launch challenges no doubt, but I know you will succeed again, because we are a team and we are in this together!\n\n234#Teamwork!|Hey Judith, just wanted to thank you for all the great teamwork on our projects recently. In particular when some clients wanted to give feedback and critiques over calls with me you stepped in and gathered feedback for me. With time difference and trying to find hours in the day that suits everyone, this could lead to a lot of delays and halt progress on the designs. So thanks a mil for your great teamwork!\n\n235#Thanks!!|Judith, it's comforting to always know that we have a back-up colleague whose knowledge is unmatched when it comes to SMB business. You're always on call when duty calls and ready to roll up your sleeves on the spot or later. There have been times when I've talked to you not sure you'd know the answer to a complex question, but alas! you never see the forest for the trees. You always have the answer ready. I'm sure many would agree especially now that we're working from home. Thanks again.\n\n236#Terrific for Tysers|In a recent email I received from the CHRO at Tysers, she could not speak more highly of the support she received during launch, saying you are a \"really fantastic partner\" and \"My team is using you as the barometer for all other system implementations…someone literally said to me today “I’m looking for WorkHuman level support on this.”  Amazing!\"  Congrats on, not only a hugely successful launch, but for making this customer a fan of WH for life and thank you for your respect for customers!\n\n237#Datafile Grabber|Judith, thanks for grabbing a couple datafiles for me this morning. What seems like should be a quick and easy task was like climbing Mt. Everest this morning between wrangling two screaming kids and two barking dogs and trying to enter in my RSA token (not to mention it was before I had coffee). I think I got bumped out 3 or 4 times before I actually got locked out. You grabbing the files helped me move along some datafile changes for two of my clients, so I really appreciate it!!\n\n238#Launch Success!|Judith & Lisa, Congratulations & THANK YOU for your hard work over these past few months. Integro launched successfully this week and I'm delighted to hear from their CHRO that she had so many great things to say about the launch process. Not only that, but Michelle really feels like we have really ramped up the whole customer experience since her days at Ghiradelli. On top of that, she's excited about Workhuman Europe and has signed up to join us in Dublin! Let's just say that Michelle is one very happy customer and that's down to the both of you. Thanks a mill'!!\n\n239#Customers Belong at WHLive!|Dear Dream Team,   I am thankful for the opportunity to have worked with each of you this past quarter. All of you provided great insight into the Workhuman Live conference culture, shared past experiences, and areas we (Customer Success) could use to level set on our approach to pitching Workhuman Live to customers. Patrick, you shot it out the park with the WHLive Elevator Pitch Builder. This great exercise will help verbalize our thoughts regarding the importance of this conference. With that said, Tim, you absolutely captured the audience with your honesty and brought the facts to back up why Customers no matter the level or location should join in the WH movement. Judith, you are right! There is no wrong time to introduce WHLive and we should use our excitement from past conferences fuel customers to register. Dan, you took the time to review all the PowerPoints, documents, created a presentation timeline, lead meetings, and kept us on our toes. Furthermore, you didn’t mind answering my million questions on the presentation deck.   Jill and Jeff, thank you for creating the WHLive playbook deck. This resource which includes customer testimonials will truly help us with recruitment.   Couldn’t leave out our leaders, Danielle and Liz. You both prioritized our team meetings, listened to us gather our thoughts, and boldly asked us to reconsider our approaches for a centralized recruitment method. Without your guidance, this wouldn’t have been possible.   What I learned from working with this team is that we truly live and are fueled by the Workhuman experience with the common goal of inspiring other companies to reconsider the future of work. Excited to hear all the Moments that Matter at this years WHLive!   Sincerely, Kel\n\n240#Thank You!!|Thank you for taking the time to meet with me on my recent visit to Framingham. It was a very productive session with good wins achieved.   I appreciate it!\n\n241#Launching into 2020|Thanks to each of you for bringing your best selves to our offsite. We came together to be vulnerable, share experiences and strategies to move our team and processes forward for efficiencies.  Thank you for your commitment to excellence for ourselves and our customers!\n\n242#Amazing Job Handling SJI|Judith, fabulous job today, handling the 4th SJI launch call. This group of individuals came in with no knowledge of Workhuman, and you were able to level set and put everyone back on track. Great work!\n\n243#Yes and has come to life...|Team, I know it is difficult to take two mornings out of your week while you have Customer calls, emails and launches happening to attend a knowledge share workshop on some of our trickiest topics.  I must say it was impressive to see everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge building upon each other thoughts.  The collaboration among such a diverse group of people and roles  was simply amazing to be a part of and witness among a group of 40 strong.  If you were wondering what Respect for All looks like...you were just a part of it and each of you made it happen!  I would be remiss without calling out your contribution to moments that matter by agreeing to be present in our workshop and any other meeting moving forward.  We all know how it feels when someone/s is multi-tasks and I was so pleased to see laptops closed and true focus and attention on the subject and task at hand.  Thank you all for a great two days, I cannot wait to see what this Team does next.\n\n244#Tool Requirements|I wanted to thank you all for your thoughtful contributions for our implementation tool requirements, not only from the requirement aspects but from the approach on how to weight, evaluate the solutions and for embracing any mindset changes. I love how we are aligned on the needs of our team to continue to make us better and for a better customer experience!\n\n245#All types of launches|You’ve done a great job, Judith, balancing your 8 SMB launches while solely focused on leading your other initial launches and post launch projects. This time of year is extra busy so the juggling act takes extra finesse! You put your customers needs first no matter how big or small they are and it shows! Well done!\n\n246#Great partners!|Hello everyone. I wanted to take a minute and thank all of you for your great team work in 2019. I see our teams as very much a partnership and I think I can speak for all of Branding when I say that as partners go - you guys are fantastic. It’s been a very busy year - with a few challenging moments - but through our collective passion, drive and determination we have delivered excellence for all our customers. I wanted to thank you all for the hard work and to wish you all happy holidays. I look forward to continuing our partnership and collaboration in 2020! Cheers!\n\n247#All together we succeed|Everyone, I wanted to recognise each of you for all you do when helping out the production support team. It has been another busy year, I for one cannot thank you all enough for everything you do to help out team out. There are countless small things that you all do that really make working here easier. There are countless things that are greatly appreciated and for those things I want to recognise you all. I still find it amazing how despite working across an ocean we have such a great comradery, friendship and can share laughs. I find it phenomenal just how much work we get through and the things we can achieve working side by side are incredible. No matter what we get the support we need and I know that together our team can give our customers a truly world class experience. Thank you all for being you and the teamwork you have displayed over the year. You are all the best :D\n\n248#Exceptional SMB Team|Guys, what can I say. We’re at the final hurdle of another year and I would like to  take the time to thank each of you for your continuous support throughout the year. Our SMB clientele is steadily growing and I’m extremely happy that I get to work alongside such a dedicated team. Each of you present and array of knowledge on our SMB  clientele. Should  any issues arise, I know I can count on you all. You make my job, and my day so much easier because I know that the information I’m given is accurate. Here’s to whatever 2020 brings for us, but I’ve no doubt that whatever comes our way will be handled in a dedicated, meticulous and professional manner. Thank you all for been there. Enjoy!!!\n\n249#When in need reach for Judith|Judith I so much appreciate your time and efforts the past couple of months as I worked on closing up a couple of accounts and getting them launched.  Several times I have come to you for information on if we could do something and what that might look like and your responses/follow up have been terrific.  We get stuck sometimes in the field on if we can offer something that a prospect is requesting and hate to commit to anything before checking.  You experience and guidance is very much appreciated.  Great work!\n\n250#Daily Wisdom|J, this is a long overdue award! I have reached out to you multiple times seeking for advice in both day-to-day and urgent matters, and you have ALWAYS taken the time to patiently help me, either through regular calls or detailed video conference calls and presentations. You taught me and the team everything about the SMB’s, you showed me the details deeply hidden within config app, you shared all information needed about every single client you transitioned, you constantly make sure SMB’s have enough balance to keep their programs running, and you are always available for any problem that arise. Thank you very much for ongoing hard work and assistance. YOU ROCK!\n\n251#Eye for efficiency|The launch team is known for constantly tweaking our processes or updating the basesite settings to make our work be more efficient. You’ve been a part of the launch team for almost 5 months where you learned our project plans and processes, and put them to practice with a few launches under your belt. You took those practices and brought your suggestions for the folder structure, basesite settings and UAT scripts that will benefit the team. Thank you for your keen eye to help with efficiencies!\n\n252#Driving success at Trimac!|Judith, congratulations on the launch of Trimac! You handled all aspects of this launch like a true pro – especially their very direct and no frills program team. With your infamous calm nature, you took it all in stride, remained patient and shared thoughtful and smart ideas along the way to help them make informed decisions. You have a reputation for being an expert on our platform, but with this being our first launch together, getting the opportunity to hear/see you in action was impressive! Thank you for helping Trimac understand not just how things work technically but also the why behind their decisions and ultimately earning their trust in you. From the regular project activities (data files, SSO, UAT, the list goes on) to more complex requests coming from their executive team five days before launch, you always offered creative solutions to keep their launch on time and in scope. I particularly loved your suggestion to send a bulk award from their CEO post-launch rather than on launch day. This would give their workforce time to download the mobile app and turn on notifications. Being a population of 80% truck drivers, e-mails are not always effective, but with notifications turned on, they might be more apt to see their award sooner. Great idea for this unique group, and Jeanine loved it too! Thank you for your true partnership on this, answering my many questions along the way, and most importantly, keeping the best interests of our customer in mind! I know you’re an ‘All Star’ in their book and definitely in mine!\n\n253#Excellence at its best|Judith, I wanted to recognise you for everything you do we work together. No matter what the task is whether its one of an infinite amount of SSO cases that we get to work on or the multiple other cases we work on. It's great to know that when you get a ticket that everything is just going to run so smoothly and is made so much easier by the wealth of information that you give to us :D Not only that but the promptness in responses to get tickets resolved as quickly as possible. It really makes working with you to be such a pleasure. You always have such a great spirit and are always so kind and funny that it makes the difficult seems so much more easy. It really proves that when both our teams work together, we really can make the impossible seem possible :D Thanks so much for everything :D\n\n254#Thank You - Framingham Visit|Thank you all for your help and support during my recent visit to the Framingham office.  The support, time, attention and friendliness I received was very much appreciated and helped me settle in quickly once I arrived.   I look forward traveling over again and also hopefully reciprocating the next time you visit the Dublin office.   Thanks again!!\n\n255#SMB Clients for Pendo|Judith thank you so much for working with us to get this over the line. You are always so super responsive and willing to go that extra mile. Much appreciated xx\n\n256#Shining in Denso's Spotlight|Judith, a huge thank you for your support on Denso over the past 3 months. Quickly establishing a trusted relationship with the customer, guiding them through their YOS design and throwing in a full, fabulous rebrand. I hugely appreciate your support and partnership. Thank you!\n\n257#Unileverage your expertise|Thank you to you both for your assistance during the Unilever launch.  Given the timeline, there needed to be quick turnaround on questions on capabilities and requests.  You both were always open to questions or quick brainstorming sessions on what we could accomplish.  Your genuine interest in the launch and your support offered has helped with learning more about how the product works and what we are capable of.  Thank you!\n\n258#Thank you!|Thank you, Judith for walking me through the process of changing the SSO configurations for a client. It's not an everyday occurance and limited information was available for reference. Without hesitation you shared not only the process and necessary documentation but also your own checklist and email template. I'm very grateful for your constant and gladful willingness to give your time to help others.\n\n259#My New Mentor!|Judith – thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity to shadow you on the intro call today with PSG/Dover.  I am thrilled to have been given the chance to learn more about the CSM world, particularly the launch side.  I have a solid understanding of how launch success is measured from a Finance perspective, but not so much from yours.  I am really excited to see this through and so appreciative of you making it happen.  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your knowledge and for your willingness to help me learn more about what you do!  Very impressive! I can't wait to see how this plays out!\n\n260#Squats Baby!|When I think of this team, the first thing that comes to mind is Resilience. A close second is Gyshido ;)  You take every customer, every launch, every project to heart to ensure the best experience for the customer and their employees. What others don’t see is that you take on every new project or task with a positive approach and attitude. Are you maxed out with the added workload – yes! Are you constantly prioritizing and re-prioritizing tasks against different customer timelines – yes! Do you have ridiculous customer complexities that are unfathomable – yes! Are you stressed – double yes! Are you trying to help your teammates and colleagues while getting your own work done – yes! Are you balancing work and home – ok…this could be an iffy, lol! But, I see each one of you giving it your best every single day.  I thought this image was awesome because you carry the weight of our customers on your shoulders and you simply just crush it. This team is why I come to work - you all inspire me!\n\n261#Thank you!|Thanks so much Judith for looking after a me for a lovely evening while on my recent trip to the Boston office. It’s so great to meet up in person and build relationships over some great food. Thanks for making the trip so enjoyable and I hope to return the favour next time you’re over :)\n\n262#5 minutes|Judith, I am sure when you see the message \"have you got 5 mins\" your first thought is \"Again??\" :-p but i wanted to take this time out to really thank you for all those conversations we have had over 5 minute periods on SMB accounts, Spend management, and even the random config questions. Regardless to the time I reach out to you, you always make sure you come back to me and give me those 5 mins. You are always there to support me and I appreciate that. Thank you and enjoy this award!\n\n263#Collaboration at its best!!|Thank you both for your support and ground work in helping the transition of the datafile transition from CSM to Client Services. With a tight deadline and lots of things to sort out, you both really drove the urgency of this and cleared away any barriers that were in the way to allow for a clean transition today.   Thanks you!!\n\n264#Customer Success Offsite 2019!!|What an amazing and talented team we have in Customer Success! I am so proud of everything we've accomplished as a team over the past quarter. Thank you Liz, Laura, and Michelle for your creativity and flawless execution of the event from beginning to end - you made the event FUN with odd activities and that was exactly what we needed! Robin and Sharon, thank you for your continued support - your workshop helped the team immensely on how to effectively manage change and it was very well received. Eric - the team was so inspired by your session that they kicked off the Gratitude Movement beyond the Workplace at Foxwoods itself (see video)! And thank you to the entire Customer Success team for your active engagement and contribution throughout the event - this event was special because of YOU, and I am so grateful that we are a team!! Thank you, All...\n\n265#Best team ever.|Guys, I would like to say a big big thank you for your continued support with all out SMB Clients. Each or you bring an array of knowledge to the table in relation to same. If ever I’m stuck for an answer, I know I can always count on all of you, at anytime. Each of you are always willing to drop everything to sort any queries we may have with our clients. All information that comes my way  is A1. As individuals, Each  of you bring something different to the table, but one thing for sure, I’m so happy  to work alongside such a dedicated, helpful team when it comes to SMB’s. I would truly be lost without each  of you. Thanks so much to you all and enjoy.\n\n266#Always helpful|Judith, I want to thank you for all of your help. No matter what the issue or question is you are always willing to talk me through it. I appreciate that you always take time to help. I look forward to learning more from you!\n\n267#Support for Follow Up Questions|Judith, I was in a time crunch to respond to a few follow up questions from a final presentation that I did last week and you were great to jump on the phone. It was obvious that they were follow up questions from another vendor that we needed to position not just that we don't do some of these things but the \"why\" we choose not to.  I appreciate the timely and great support!\n\n268#Re: RSS|Judith, thanks for walking the client services team through the process to set up and access a secure RSS Award News feed in order to display recognition activity on an intranet location. The information and docs shared with us are useful, and I hope to start working on the integration for Five Prime by tomorrow.   John\n\n269#Long Overdue...|Judith - you are an absolute asset to our CS Team and I am so grateful for your expertise and support. Since the beginning, I have relied on your boundless knowledge to ask countless questions and get your advice on configuration issues. Even with your loaded workload managing clients, you recently took over the reins of onboarding/development for a number of new hires on the CS team. You flawlessly embraced this opportunity by leading me and the others through detailed demo preparation and execution as well as mentoring us through the new Product Knowledge outline. On top of that, you took the initiative to enhance continuous learning by organizing weekly Q&A sessions for CSMs and Specialists to go over important topics such as Client Invoices, SOLI, Complex Eligibility Rules, etc. I truly appreciate the time and effort you pour into each meeting and the eye-opening pieces of feedback you offer during every presentation. I admire the eloquent way you paint each story with your words and your ability to dissolve down complex topics into clear understandings. Thank you for all that you do!\n\n270#Awesome Mood Tracker Conversation!|Judith,  Wanted to say thank you for joining the Solution Consulting Team Call today and sharing such great perspective around our current Mood Tracker capabilities, current customer usage and what's coming soon in terms of updates to Recognition Intelligence.  We only planned a 30 minute conversation but ended up talking the full hour!   Thanks for leaving us with so many great insights and ideas on how we can better support our prospects to understand the value of turning on this tool!\n\n271#One more time...|Judith! Thank you so much for the amount of time and patience you've put in to scheduling various trainings for us newbies to ensure we're all ramped up and ready to work with our customers. Also, as much as I didn't want to hear you say those words, \"Let's have you practice and go through the demo one more time\", it was surely for the better! You pushed me to go back, iron out my wording and work on grasping the underlying meaning for what we do, vs. memorizing....an exercise that has amply prepared me, now 4 months in. Thank you, thank you!\n\n272#Teamwork at its finest|Judith, thank you for taking the time to have a presales call with Foundation Medicine. This call was a great reminder of all the success we have brought to Workhuman over the last five+ years. Ultimately we did not win this particular deal but its our teamwork that has added 50+ new clients. We have given these client's employees the chance to experience the power of recognition and that is truly a great accomplish Thanks again!\n\n273#Thank you!|Thank you both for showing a true respect for teamwork last week! I was out of the office in DR for Sales Leadership Club and our client Shanelle @ PresenceLearning needed help and you both jumped in to save the day! I really appreciate you both and it makes my job much easier knowing I have great teammates.\n\n274#Solving Eligibility Mysteries!|Judith, thank you for helping me with all of my recent eligibility questions for my clients!  Especially this week for taking an hour + to sit with me during your busy day to help me mystery solve when I couldn't get something to work.  You are so patient and always willing to take the time any situation needs to find the answer and to make sure things are done right.  You truly leave no stone unturned while helping to solve all my mysteries.  This isn't the first time and I know it won't be the last, so thank you, thank you, thank you for your continued support!\n\n275#Mystery Solved!|Judith, thank you so much for being such a reliable source of information. Your willingness to help is astounding. I had been looking at delegate approval reporting for Lockheed Martin for nearly 2 hours and after you overheard a conversation between Patrick and I you jumped right in and we’re able to provide insight to why the numbers seemed so off, and guided me in the right direction. Thank you for being so committed to helping the people around you!\n\n276#Going above and beyond|Judith, thank you so much for helping Thermo Fisher with Spend Management today! Steve knew I was traveling and so when he needed to demo Spend Management to his boss in just under an hour you jumped right in to assist. Since activating the feature in sandbox would have required a data file to run and there was not enough time, you offered up your time to jump on the call and demo Spend Management from our sales demo site. The client was thrilled and the call with his manager was informative and productive. Thanks for being so helpful in a pinch!\n\n277#Document Detective|Judith, a quick call out for your noticing and bringing to my attention a few updates needed to product documentation recently. With the extensive project to rebrand the entire Product Taxonomy library, a few items were possible to fall through the cracks. Thanks for  helping to keep the taxonomy in order!\n\n278#Webinar Wonders|Thank you for stepping in to support ACI's Conversations webinar yesterday. Luke, you are consistently reliable, professional and responsive to every request I send your way related to the many moving parts that comprise a great webinar experience. Lisa, I can't thank you enough for jumping into the deep end with your first ever live webinar! You are the only consultant to make a webinar debut in Conversations! It meant so much to me that you were willing to pinch-hit while I was at Harman yesterday and you were a smashing success! Judith, you graciously went above and beyond by carving out time from your schedule to attend the session, attending a layer of support and peace-of-mind, just in case the customer had any unusual or unexpected questions about the product. Great job all! Many thanks again!\n\n279#Behind the Scenes!|An overdue thank you for behind the scenes support that helped make sure the Cisco redesign went live with out a hitch! Judith - thank you for the guidance and walking us through all the potential gotcha's when proofing and pushing a redesign to production. Allie and Rachel - thank you for helping me tackle all of the proofing that needed to get done. Thanks to your help we pushed the new site live smoothly and have had nothing but positive feedback!\n\n280#WBAU wonder women|Thank you both SO very much for donating your time on a FRIDAY NIGHT (after 5 PM) to go through the WBAU file for Workhuman Live and search each and every error...one by one. With no time to waste and LOTS of emails to research and correct, you came to the rescue knowing I just could not get to this with the long list I already had to finish before the event. You helped me out more than you know. I appreciate you both a ton!\n\n281#DREAM config TEAM|Thank you for your dedication to getting the data file download for my practical figured out and to be successful! I really appreciate your patience and commitment to helping me troubleshoot and keep at it until we 'got-er-done'. There were so many little efforts you helped me uncover that I wouldn't have been able to identify without you. Happy to have such a fabulously detail oriented and positive team.\n\n282#Thanks for the help with Brother USA and CA|Judith and Steen I appreciate your help on the call today with Brother USA, Canada and their procurement guy. Your attitudes was great and you were able to keep us in a good place with Tony and Christa. Thanks again!\n\n283#I&TS Cafe is Live Thanks to You|Wanted to take the time to thank you for supporting me during RBC's new I&TS Cafe program configuration. You continuously provided me with guidance and best practices on program configuration; specifically how to properly pitch the idea to the client and maintain their trust throughout the process. With your help, we were able to configure and push to production ahead of schedule. Many thanks!\n\n284#LogMeWin Issue Fixed|Thank you all of the speed and the effort you put towards getting the LogMeWin sales program fixed. A unique spend issue came up with this client and it put the continuation of the program in jeopardy. This power team formed on Christmas Eve and eight business days later there is a fix. Amazing work!\n\n285#Taking Teva Global|Taking a program global with an entirely new program & leadership team is no easy feat.  It takes many hands and countless hours of planning, educating, and delivering.  This team has put their heart into this customer to support their pursuit to re-build their culture across the globe.  Claire, thank you for being my co-pilot over the past few weeks, you have put so much work into this 3-day \"marathon-of-a-meeting\" this week.  Long hours and juggling all of the other things that you have going on at the same time.  Naomi, your efforts to educate this customer are above and beyond, to say the least and you too gave much of your week to support Yael's visit to the states.  I can't thank you both enough for your help.  I also want to thank Judith for all of her hard work carrying Teva along through this process while Claire was out, you have also been amazing. To Chris O, who has been supportive and dedicated every step of the way.  To Rachel who has been the wind beneath the RTL project and the goal to launch our first customer in Hebrew!  And to the others who made this week's meetings so impactful: Grant, Stacey, Laury, Sarah, Jay, & Luke!  I wish I could say that we are done, but we have lots more to do!  I just couldn't let the work over the past couple of months pass by without recognizing the amazing people on this team and the impact that all of your talent and hard work has done to set this customer up for success. Thank you!!\n\n286#IT Judith!|Judith, awesome job getting to the bottom of our order form printing issues. Clients and prospects were having a hard time sending us an order form with all the information. You stepped in and wrote a great step by step guide to fix this. I just used this again with another client. Awesome work.\n\n"
"287##askjudith|This has been a long time coming. I want to thank you for always coaching and helping when asked. There have been countless times over the last year and a half that you have dropped what you are doing to help answer a question for me (and so many others!) You don't just give an answer but you take the time to sit down and walk through the answer so that the resolution is fully understood. When I was having a hard time understanding the math behind the SOLI mercer data you took the time to meet with me and walk me through it in a way that I could understand it, even offered to get on a call and help the client understand it. When a few of us suggested a slack channel for us to ask you questions while you were away without hesitation you said absolutely! #ASKJUDITH (and we have been utilizing it quite a bit!!) Your respect for teamwork is inspiring and I hope one day that I will have as much knowledge as you. Thank you for ALL that you have done to help us, but especially me. :)\n\n288#Forever helpful!|Judith, you are one of those people that is always top of mind when I need help.  I suppose it is that way since whenever I ask you something, I get the impression that you TRULY do want to help.  Recently you have been incredibly gracious with your time in helping me with a couple client programs, the behind the scenes reporting and even pricing positioning from the customer success perspective.  I just want you to know that I appreciate you... and my apologies if your helpfulness creates a burden to your time. :)\n\n289#Team Blue!|Ladies, thank you so much for your help with the BCBS Benefits Fair! Between taking the time out of your week to attend, speaking to employees and fielding a variety of questions, I appreciate your teamwork on this event! The program team for Reward Blue was thrilled to have us there and reported back that the app was a huge hit with their employees. This was truly a team effort and it would not have been a success without all of your smiling faces! Thank you so much for being Team Blue!\n\n290#SMB chats|Brian, Judith. I want to say a big thank you for your continuous support with SMB’s clients. Whether it be a new client or existing,  You both constantly keep me informed and  up to date. I speak to you both almost everyday on Skype regarding same and your knowledge of the  SMB Clientele is admirable. Whether it be new clients, points purchase, launches or spend, I’m kept in the loop.  You both make my job much easier by keeping me informed on a daily basis while also organising weekly Skype calls to go over each client. This award is long over due, but I want you both to know that I really appreciate all you do for our SMB’s and all you do to make my job flow smoothly. Thanks so much and enjoy!!!\n\n291#Teamwork makes the dream work!|A HUGE thank you to each and every one of you for helping me migrate Covance to the new UI. This project has quite literally been years in the making. Covance’s internal resources were limited and they pushed back the launch at least 4 times! They also kept us busy with branding changes, SSO updates and program design tweaks right up until the week before the launch! I couldn’t have completed this project without each and every one of you. From guidance on configurations and volunteering to help with their launch, on a Saturday no less, this team was stellar. Now that Covance is on the new UI we have to opportunity to expand their experience to other aspects of the WorkHuman cloud. Thank you!!\n\n292#LinkedIn Upgrade Team|Thank you so much for letting me crash your team meeting today!  As I had mentioned, Social Selling and Employer Brand are two big initiatives that we can all play a part in.  Having consistency (and fun!) on LinkedIn will help get our name and reputation out there faster.  We appreciate any and all LinkedIn help - thank you all for participating!\n\n293#Dream Team|Thank you all SO MUCH for taking such wonderful care of my clients while I was on maternity leave. I appreciate all the time you spent prior to me leaving to get up-to-speed on the intricacies of each account, as well as all the work you've done the past four months. It gave me such peace of mind knowing I could leave them in such capable hands and just focus on my little guy. Thanks for being such amazing team members-- Shane sends his love!\n\n294#Thanks|Judith - thanks for the help you always render to us. Yesterday like has been the case on other occasions, myself and colleagues felt it was a good idea to seek your input on how to come up with a better wording of a response that seemed easy, yet complex enough to upset a client if not phrased cautiously. You did and the rest is history.   Cheers\n\n295#Vistaprint over the finish line!|Team,  Thank you for all your help and dedication to getting the deal with Vistaprint over the finish line.  David, thank you for your help securing meetings and keeping the two Vistaprint attendees at WorkHuman engaged.  Marcy, you expertise with customer success and change management was crucial in making their decision.  Judith and Brian, you really stepped up to help me once we had to shift and start them in the business edition platform with a growth strategy in place.  You jumped on calls with me and the prospect to explain and make the process very easy.  Hillary, I appreciate your extra efforts with this contract.  You jumped on multiple calls as well and tried to get us us as much flexibility as possible with this type of contract.  Sales is a team sport at Globoforce.  The Vistaprint logo is on our customer page because of all the great work each of you did to get it there! Cheers!\n\n296#Great Hospitality|Thanks, guys for being so friendly and welcoming to me while I was in the Framingham office. Thanks for the office tour and for introducing me to the CS team. You guys are awesome! So happy to be soon part of your team! :-)\n\n297#Working Human|Judith, just want to say how much I appreciated you taking time to ask me about my recent visit to the office when I was hobbling around with crutches. You showed genuine interest in my well being and even gave me some recommendations on ankle braces I should think about wearing moving forward. PS I might need those links again :-) Thank you for taking time to show you care - it was a small gesture that really meant a lot.\n\n298#The Perfect First Launch Call|Judith, tremendous job today on the first launch call with FivePrime. This client had a true sense of urgency behind getting this program launch and you were able to match their energy. By sharing your screen and walking them through the branding/launch materials I believe this gave them great comfort that they are in the right hands. Thank you!!!!\n\n299#Business Edition Guru for Vistaprint|Judith, Nicely done on our call with Vistaprint today.  You positioned the Business model well and answered their questions thoroughly.  I spoke with them after the call to gain their feedback and they told me they were happy with the answers.  They are crunching numbers right now.  If they get approved, we will be moving to contracts by the end of next week.  I appreciate your quality approach on the call today.  You have a pleasant way of positioning and educating the prospect.  Thank you for your help! Cheers!\n\n300#Feedback from Customer!|Judith, this week Lynne and I were speaking with Tony who is the program manager for Brother International.  At the end of the call, he stopped us because he wanted to call out how terrific his experience was with you.  He said that they have many vendor relationships and ours is clearly and by far the best one.  He said that they feel it is a true partnership and the level of service is amazing.  Great work!!!!\n\n301#A True Config Hero|I am impressed with all of the knowledge you have been able to store and compartmentalize over the years. Your expertise and knowledge sharing has been a huge asset to the Customer Success team and myself in particular. I am glad you were able to jump in and solve the Config puzzle I had been working on for the past 24 hours. Thank you for your support and brain power you have soaked up during your time here at Globoforce!\n\n302#Keeping Thermo Hot|Team - just a quick moment to say thanks to you all for keeping Thermo Fisher happy during this slow global rollout!  They have been moving along and as we approach another July 1 division launch it is great to see how Steve appreciates all of you and the work you have been doing.  These guys were a long time getting here and are becoming a great customer a little bit ( or large bit ) at a time.  Each of you are dueing (Claire) great work and Steve really believes we have their best interest at heart!  Well done team.\n\n303#A big thank you!|Girls, a massive thank you for helping me out this week. You went above and beyond to get a package across to me. Thank you and enjoy!\n\n304#My Top Collaborator!|Judith, it’s no wonder that each week MyAnalytics tells me that you’re my top collaborator – and the system has no idea how much you help me offline either! Thank you for being my go-to for my many questions each and every day. There’s rarely a day that goes by that I’m not asking you a question or bouncing an idea around. In addition, you’ve done a great job of getting up to speed on the five clients you’ll be handling for me when I go on maternity leave. I know this has taken up a lot of your time, whether it be joining client calls, learning background information in a 1:1, or talking through a client question or upcoming project. Thanks for being such an incredible team member and for all your support. I know my clients will be in great hands!\n\n305#Launch Guru|Judith- thank you so much for joining me on a last minute call with BSWH's Chief Employee Experience Officer yesterday! To say this re-launch has been a challenge is a complete understatement! The re-launch date has continued to be an issue for awhile now, and BSWH has not wanted to take our recommendation (or really our here is what we are committing to for a launch date) too seriously. The Chief Employee Experience Officer wanted to really get a better understanding as to how much time each and every single deliverable in the project plan would take so that he could be better prepared when bringing this information to the rest of the Executive Team. You shared your experience with all of your 40+ launches to put things into perspective for the team, which added the perfect touch to the message that we were trying to convey...that being that July 2nd was not going to happen based on where we are at today!  As a SCSM, we do not tend to get involved in all things launch related, so having your support and expertise on the call was SO helpful. After the call, you then helped me go through the project plan and assign new dates to each of the deliverables, based on a July 23rd launch. You know all of the little tips and tricks for where there is wiggle room and where there is not...which I would have never have known without your guidance. Thank you so much for being such an amazing team player!!\n\n306#Keep Calm and Learn From the Best|Judith, When I did some outreach to determine who would be able to give a thorough overview and training on manager reporting tools, the resounding recommendation was you! Since the S&C team does many webinars during the launch process, I wanted to ensure that I had a thorough understanding of the subtleties and features of Recognition Intelligence, Team View and Team Maps. You were gracious to agree to host the training session, and remained gracious, even as we added more attendees to benefit from your guidance! Of course, the overview you gave was on point, understandable and I know we will all be stealing your stories and examples for our own use during client conversations. On behalf of Danielle, Maggie, Sarah, Patrick, and myself, thank you for sharing your expertise and ensuring we have an accurate understanding of the many features of our platform.\n\n307#UNUMbelievable Job!|Judith, you absolutely crushed it at the Unum account review yesterday!  It was wonderful to see in person how much work, effort and knowledge you bring to your customers.  On several occasions you read their cues and moved into different directions than you were planning to go in.  I could tell how well received this was and I personally think it is going to pay dividends as they work towards a higher budget and adopting timelines and MoodTracker. As to Conversations, you had invited me to this meeting the week after my new role was announced (back in January)!  Although they are not ready for this level of the Cloud, you brought the main decision maker to the table and helped to create awareness for the future.  I am still blown away that you essentially \"called it\" in relation to their readiness and all of their reasons why.  You really know your customers!   Thank you for the opportunity to run my first Conversations meeting and to build a new relationship with a valued customer!!\n\n308#SMB Ongoing Management - and that's all folks!|Great job Judith over the last few years both launching and managing the SMB book of business!  I am thrilled that we have today moved all the 27 SMB accounts eligible for Project Odyssey over to Client Services team to manage ongoing, with the 5 in launch now launching directly into this model. Thank you for helping us prepare and train the Client Services team to take these over as we move into a more efficient and scalable model!  You will still be launching these SMB accounts for the moment and we appreciate your valuable insight as we look to make the launch phase more efficient and scalable also.  Thank you and job well done!\n\n309#FLU Coverage|Hi Judith, thank you for stepping in and responding to our customers while I was out of action. I came down with a crazy Texas flu and was unable to respond back to a couple urgent matters. Your sense of teamwork and urgency was key. Thanks again.\n\n310#Passkey Pro|Judith - A huge thank you for setting up Passkey for next year's WorkHuman.  We were seriously working at max capacity and you taking this on was an absolute lifesaver.\n\n311#Those last minute changes...|Judith, I just wanted to say thank you for covering for me last week while I was traveling for a couple client visits! Of course a client about to launch R&R decided to make a last minute Design change - thank you for jumping on that item, submitting the ticket to get Sandbox updated and confirming back with Mel & Joni, so they could action their piece as well. I appreciate your support and the quick response to get this item taken care of very much!!\n\n312#Migration Maven|Judith, thanks so much for jumping in to help me review Covance's new UI. You quickly helped me identify discrepancies on their test site and provided direction on what I need to do next to ensure a successfully testing and migration. The project is still underway and I am sure I will have a million more questions so thank you in advance for always saying \"come on down!\" when I ask if you have a \"second\" for a question. I greatly appreciate your help!\n\n313#Great Customer Feedback From Pacira!|Thank you Judith for delighting our customers ongoing!  Great to receive feedback from our customers regarding what a great job we are doing!   Thank you!!!  From Francine at Pacira: Thanks for all of your help and being so responsive this week (and up to this week) to help us get ready to launch.  I gave a brief update to our Exec Leaders today and they are positive, ready to own supporting this to their teams and ready for this to go live on Monday.  We are making a difference at Pacira and you are a part of it!   Thank you Judith!\n\n314#Last Minute Passkey Help|Anne Marie & Judith - you both dropped what you were doing to help me understand what Passkey was and why my Executive Forum candidate didn't have the ability to book a hotel. I appreciate your sense of urgency but more importantly you both showed great teamwork in working with me. Thank you!\n\n315#Smb queen|Judith, I want to say a big thank you for all your help with the SMB clients in 2017. You’ve went above and beyond to make sure all our clients are up to date with no down time. With the ever growing list of SMB clients, you managed to set up weekly meetings so we could discuss each client in detail. I really enjoyed our little chats and  informative weekly meetings to make sure Clients are up to date. Here’s to a great 2018. Thanks so much. Enjoy.\n\n316#SOLI Support|Judith, your diligence and scrutiny of the Client SOLI Analysis file is much appreciated! You are deep into the weeds of this MASSIVE file, and raising items that need to be addressed. The resulting updates are a benefit to all our Customer Success team and clients!\n\n317#Dream Team|The branding team would like to thank you all for the great work over the past 12 months. We admire your ability to keep everything moving on different projects and keeping us in the loop and up to date. Have a lovely Christmas and we look forward to working with you in 2018!\n\n318#Great Support|Judith what a 7 weeks! You upped sticks without any concerns...even sorting your own Visa last minute, nothing phased you. You arrived into the team in Dublin and instantly slotted right in. You continued to do your role while helping Lorraine come up the curve, assist in the overall project, helped with recruitment for the new team and many other tasks. It was great having you and thanks for all your help ensuring we are set up for success in the future, your contributions were invaluable. Thanks Jim\n\n319#SMB Milestones in 2017|I want to thank you all for your efforts in 2017 helping to push SMB to new heights. As Ben says \"selling is a team sport\" and this holds true in the SMB market. Without us all working together we would not have been able to hit 3 million dollars in sales this year, sign our 40th customer and have lots of fun along the way. Thank you all again and I am very excited to see what new milestones we hit in 2018!\n\n320#Training across the pond|Judith- In your absence this week I have been spending time with Victoria and Lorraine. I am very impressed with what Lorraine has picked up already, and she did really well with the Practical that I sent, and both she and Victoria asked really good, intelligent questions so I could tell they had learned a lot! Great work multitasking with the trainings, your client work, and adapting to a new environment!\n\n321#Thank you|This is to say a Big thank you for taking your time to explain and present useful information that would assist me with my new position in Globoforce.  Thank you all.\n\n322#Fountain of Knowledge|Judith, thank you so much for the impromptu mood tracker learning session we had this morning. I found it so helpful! Firstly you showed me where I can find the results but then you took me through all the different graphs, then specifically looking at my client and reviewing their results. I really appreciate this Next time I will schedule time rather than just arriving at your desk : ) Thanks again!\n\n323#Thank you!|Thank you so much for your help with that \"Work Circle\" issue! You are not the CSM for that specific client, but you were more than happy to help me dealing with it. Your help avoided an escalation and guaranteed a faster reply to the customer. Thank you!!\n\n324#Just a Skype away!|Just after our Passkey integration you left for your Dublin venture. More than a few hiccups have come up since you've been gone. Each time we know that you're just a Skype away to solve minor issues, identify bugs that need to be escalated to the developer and find ingenious work arounds that don't come straight out of a user manual. Your accessibility and insight is greatly appreciated!\n\n325#Knowledge Transfer|Judith, thanks so much for the amount of knowledge you have transferred to us in the Self-Service team recently. Your knowledge of SMB and Enterprise clients is invaluable to us. You have been able to bring us through many topics including dataloads, configurations, frequently asked questions and the points top-up process. All of this information is allowing us to plan out the Self-Service roadmap more efficiently. We already feel closer to the client and have a much better understanding of their needs and wants. I hope you don't mind if we continue to send questions your way in the future. Thanks again for all of the great help, it's very much appreciated!\n\n326#Getting It Done!!|Thank you so much for all of your help setting up and cleaning up the GloboCafe for our annual Chili competition/Patriots Season Opener! It takes a village to make wonderful events happen and I really appreciate you jumping in!!\n\n327#Fountain of knowledge !|Judith, I really want to say a big THANK YOU for so willingly sharing your knowledge with me and the entire CS team since you have been over in Dublin. There have been so many client specifics I only learned over the last few weeks from you and this knowledge is really helpful. Thank you for always replying straight away and with so much enthusiasm , for diving deep into issues I ask you to clarify, for doing tests and simulations in Sandbox and providing screenshots to make things easier to understand......and  most importantly for  just being here ,being great fun and a wonderful colleague !!!\n\n328#Cheers to Campari!|Judith, excellent first launch call with Janet from Campari! I really appreciate the way you handled all of her questions and set her up for a successful Q1 2018 launch. This was your first SMB launch call done from your Dublin apartment but it won't be the last! Thank you again.\n\n329#Thank you|Judith,  I want to thank and recognise you for the time you invested this week in beginning to get me up to speed with Globoforce's system and procedures. Your extensive knowledge is most impressive and your passion and enthusiasm for your role and the company is infectious.\n\n330#No problem :)|Judith I was amazed when we asked you to come over to Dublin for an extended period it was \"no problem\" .  All last week during your preparation when there was a million details to resolve it was still \"no problem\".  You arrived at the office and were thrown straight away into the deep end and even then stepped in immediately to ensure that Lorraine's first week was action packed and filled with learning.  When we got shortlisted for the CCMA awards and had 2 days to prepare a presentation, you not only picked up a bunch of things for me, but then even offered to be the audience to several trial runs.   What an amazing first week you have had in Dublin, and what great teamwork you have exhibited throughout.  Well done!\n\n331#Thank-YOU! :)|Thanks for your help throughout my onboarding process. Such a wonderful  demonstration of Globoforce's culture. You rock!  Krishna\n\n332#WorkHuman Passkey Training|Thank you all for the hours of homework and then hours of training you put into learning Passkey. We will be able to provide a better experience for our attendees as well as allow us to have more insight to our multiple hotel blocks. WH is really growing up and I appreciate your help in learning the tools to keep up with it.\n\n333#SSOE and Conversations|Judith, congratulations on getting your customer SSOE signed as the second official global adopter of Conversations!  Your persistence and cultivation of this customer through WorkHuman and the entire Conversations process was fantastic.  Well done!\n\n334#user research help q|Judith,  Thank you so much for helping us with external user research. Your efforts to find participants and schedule meetings are a great help for us. Doing studies like that truly help us to practices human centered design. This ultimately means that we can hear the problems of our users first-hand, analyzes them and provide solutions that truly help our users. Thank you =]\n\n335#Westinghouse-GloboForce Own Brand Card Launch|Hi guys, I wanted to thank you for your hard work & collaboration in getting the Globoforce generic card launched on the Westinghouse program. While pre-paid cards are not suitable for all programs & use is limited, it is great to have the opportunity to promote our own brand. Thanks, Fintan\n\n336#Validating the logos!|Judith, thank you for your eagle eye and for reaching out after you saw some logos on a slide they didn't belong on (naughty logos!). That helped me ensure that the next time we use that slide I could get it right and your help on a Friday morning closely reviewing the logos and using your knowledge of what's a new client, what's an expansion, and what's the precise logo for each company helped me be confident that this V2 of the slide is now accurate. Thank you for always being willing to pitch in and also thank you for speaking up when you saw something that was inaccurate. That type of attention to detail is incredibly helpful!\n\n337#UI Team Visit|Guys, on behalf of the UI team- I just want to thank you all so much for taking the time last week to meet us and introduce yourselves to Kevin. It was really great to get an overview on what challenges both teams face and how we can try work the solutions into our new and improved processes. We all really enjoyed spending time sitting with you all, you made us feel very welcome! We hope we can afford you the same hospitality when you guys are over this side of the pond!\n\n338#JLL - Opening New Doors|We knew that the launching JLL was going to have some challenges, but we also knew that Globoforce was the only partner that had the experience and capability to make them successful. They're not even live yet, and the fantastic work you've put in is already leading to other new opportunities! I just had a meeting with Compass Group, a 220, 000 Employee company that provides foodservice and support services for other large companies. We've spent the last 2 years trying to find business teams  at Compass to help support HR's recognition initiative. It turns out that JLL and Compass both support Google. The great work you've done on the Google portion of the JLL launch has lead to that team telling the Compass Google Team about the amazing experience! That's the connection we've been trying to create, and your support of JLL helped us get there. Amazing work! Thank you so much for all your effort and for doing all the little things that matter. They do make a difference!\n\n339#Great Customer Feedback|Thank you Judith for always having your finger on the pulse of your customers needs - I am constantly impressed by your professionalism, attention to detail, passion and drive towards Customer Success!  Today was just another example of great customer feedback!  Claudia from logmein wrote a thank you note for a great launch experience that you provided: \"Thank you so much for all your help and support in the last months and that we can go live today! You did an amazing job ?\"  Well done Judith and keep up the great work!\n\n340#Well spotted|Thanks so much for spotting my glasses and remembering where you had seen them. I had checked in that meeting room, but without my glasses I didn't see them!!! :-) My spare pair are in Dublin, so I would have been struggling for the rest of the week. Thank you\n\n341#An Insight into the World of SMB Clients|Judith, thank you so much for letting me see into the world of SMB clients as part of my studies into the Freemium business model.  It was really interesting to learn the differences between our SMB and Enterprise clients based on their launch time, employee numbers, payment models, etc. I find it fascinating how, with some extra effort, these SMB clients could self-serve themselves with configuration and tutorials and how these features could also be used by our enterprise clients. The most interesting fact however, was how these clients grow in confidence once they take on our recognition offering. It really does ask the question, what if there was a free service they could use before becoming comfortable with our offering? And could we attract more SMB clients in this way? Thanks again for the taking the time out of your busy day to share these fantastic insights with me.\n\n342#New employee on-boarding extraordinaire|Judith, Thanks so much for helping Melody and I with all of our on-boarding training and all of the questions we have on top of that. You are so thoughtful with your answers to our questions and give us the time and space we need to think through all of the processes and product features we are learning. Whether it is trusting us to try out some of our new configuration skills with your clients or just having us sit with you to learn more you've been and continue to be a great resource to us. Thank you!\n\n343#They love you. They really, really love you.|Judith, I've said before that there is nothing more gratifying as a leader than hearing a customer say wonderful things about your colleagues. On three separate occasions during WorkHuman last week, customers of yours went out of their way to tell me how amazing you are. SSOE, Exact Sciences and MasTech all sung your praises. One customer is great, two is fantastic, but when three separate customers take their time to tell me, that's a pattern. It indicates a consistent level of excellence in your work. Well done! Keep up the amazing work!\n\n344#Leading the Lightning Talks|You were super busy at WorkHuman! You were tending to our customers, prospects and facilitating roundtables. Yet, you made the time to prep for lightning talks! You did a fabulous job of making our customers feel comfortable, ask them the right questions and select highlights from their program to showcase what other companies could do! This was a very different format for speaking but you executed it flawlessly! Thank you for running with an idea and bringing it to life!\n\n345#Continuing the Conversation|Thank you both for continuing the conversation yesterday with the Integrated DNA Technologies team. Your insights into current clients programs was very helpful. I appreciate your help!\n\n346#Power-up!|Thank you Judith thank you for your great work on Westinghouse - from Karen McGlade, : \"Judith – I can’t remember if I thanked you for the prompt resolution of the issue this morning.  We appreciated it very much.  I’d give you a PowerUP award if I could :-)\"\n\n347#Test down|Judith, thanks for responding to Moderna while I was locked out of test today. Also thank you for being so patient while we were fixing some teething issues with access over here yesterday!\n\n348#Taking care of the family|Judith - I have seen you always helping out in the kitchen in the old building and now in the new building. You are always quick to empty a dishwasher, stock a fridge or replace what is empty. With Laury out, you have been keeping things moving for all of your Globofamily this week. Thank you much for all that you do!\n\n349#Config app Assistance|Just to say thanks for your help and feedback over the last few weeks with the SWAT team while we were working on the new award linking feature. You were able to attend the demo's and provide feedback so we could make small tweaks to make sure it met the needs of the CSM team. And you even helped with some error messages! Thanks again and I look forward to working with you for the next round of config app changes.\n\n350#\"Auto-On\" of Merchandise|Team, thank you so much for moving 20 of our Clients ($16M in billings) onto merchandise the past weekend.  It was certainly a TEAM effort to scope the project, outline which Clients we could \"experiment\" with, test the changes and ultimately push the changes live.  Thank you again for all the support and ideas that allowed us to move this initiative forward.  Well done!!!\n\n351#Pack it up, pack it in!|Like any big move, there is a lot of time and preparation that goes into getting everything ready.  Offices need to be packed, closets need to be emptied, an entire kitchen with more food than in most people's houses needed to be organized and packed away and the list goes on....Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to help us get organized and ready to go.  Your efforts helped to make the move go as smoothly as possible.  Thanks again.  Sincerely, the move team (Chris, Sarah, Laury, Mark, Jess)\n\n352#Clean Sweep|A little late-- but wanted to recognize the two of your for your help in prepping for Staple's visit to Southborough. You are both such great team players, dependable, and absolutely wonderful humans to work with. You jumped right in, without being asked, covering up labels on our coffee machines, and removing boxes from sight-- all with great speed and attention to detail. THANK YOU!!\n\n353#User research help|Thank you so much for all the time you guys took so far to help me to progress with my user research around the new navigation for our program. It is essential for our product to have these initiatives to gain a better understanding of how our users use the product, this way we can keep improving it =]\n\n354#Gilead Guide|Judith, thank you for all your energy, focus and patients as you guided the Gilead team to this successful launch.  I know there were many challenges due to client delays and outside pressures but you persevered to get another silicon valley icon launched and on their way to the successful start.  Thank you for leading the way and all you did to make this happen.\n\n355#Onboarding Thank You!|I just wanted to say thank you for everything as I have been onboarding and getting up to speed - from answering any questions I have, to letting me listen in on your calls and walking through and explaining all of your day to day tasks. You have not only been so helpful and patient with all of my questions but have made me feel so welcome!  Thanks again and hopefully I can repay you both by starting to get some work off of your plate! :)\n\n356#Remarkable References|I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you, thank you, thank you for your referenceable customers. Not just one customer but multiple referenceable customers over a significant amount of time! This is a testament to your commitment to your customers to ensure their satisfaction with their program, Globoforce and more importantly, you. You make a difference to them which allows them to be referenceable to help grow our business!\n\n357#Judith WOW's Mary Kay|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Customers!  Judith, you WOW'd Mary Kay from pre-launch through launch with your passion, expertise, knowledge and can-do attitude.  From moment one, they hit with \"We want to just leverage the technology\" and configure the system using our current program design.  We both knew, to reap the true rewards and impact of social recognition it's not just leverage our technology.  You had to have some \"tough\" conversations about configuration which were all well positioned and received.  You're passion and energy for what you do and how you wanted Mary Kay's program to be the most successful in company history shined through.  Numerous times the program team said to you \"You are such a great partner.  Thank you for all that you do.  We enjoy working with you.\"  That's a testament to how you work and live.  And then you graciously agreed to be part of the Launch day festivities which created amazing excitement and awareness for the program.  In 2 short weeks, Mary Kay employees across the globe have received more than 740  recognition and YOS awards.  A great start for a client with 5,000 employees.  Seeing you on launch day in your WOW t-shirt was the icing on the cake!  Nothing like WOWing the Mary Kay program team and your colleagues from start to finish.  Thank you for everything you do to make client's cultures and programs GREAT!  Well done!\n\n358#WOW - Mary Kay Launch success!|Judith and Michela - what a pleasure it was this past week to join you at Mary Kay corporate in Dallas to launch their WOW program.  What a journey it has been with them, starting at the demo station with their VP Total Rewards at our first Workhuman - and now - WOW! is celebrated by yet another few thousand employees around the world.  Judith, your partnership through their pre-launch helped Andrew and I truly deliver our sales promises; Michela your energy was contagious!  Their team was so impressed with your delivery and hard work, and the sheer amount of ambassadors you helped garner from across their business lines and culture committee made the WOW program uniquely theirs, vs. just another program provided by a HR vendor.  (Only because of you did I walk away with a hefty bag of Mary Kay men's products - which are clearly sorely needed!)  Thank you for driving their success - a great new logo for Globoforce!  (Now if we could just figure out how to have them redeem their pink Cadillacs through WOW!)\n\n359#WOW is right!|Judith,  fantastic job on the Mary Kay launch.  You've built a program they love and a great relationship in the process.  Also kudos for bringing up our upcoming Conversations and Life Events options; the client is already excited for both and look forward to working with us.  Thank you for all you hard work!\n\n360#SMB Queen!|Thank you Judith for driving the success of our SMB customers!  We now have 22 SMB customers live and 9 launched this year alone We have also broken the $1M mark for 2016 renewals and point purchases for SMB!  You have been a critical part of this success delivering a great customer experience whilst partnering with product to ensure we are developing a low touch solution that can maximize the customer's experience and program success.  It is great to see unsolicited feedback like this form our customers - this from Liana at Primary Capital \"Thanks for being on top of things as usual Judith!!  (I’d send you a take a bow if I could….haha!!)\",  Thank you Judith.  Thank you also for jumping in and helping us address a surge in new business a few months ago by taking on the launch of Mary Kay and Gilead!  You are a true team player and we appreciate all that you do to deliver Customer Success!  Thank you and Happy New Year!\n\n361#Thanks for getting me in!|Thank you so much in assisting me in getting access to Config App, Test Utils, and Globotrack before leaving on vacation! Because of the strings you were able to pull, I'll be able to get some translations done next week. I really appreciate that you took the time to assist me and I know that the team will also really appreciate that I'll be able to start helping them out more and more.\n\n362#Just Adding Some Features... No Big Deal|Judith, you have done an excellent job taking on the task of implementing our new features for our SMB customers.  When nuvs and I approached you about adding the Employee Digest, Manager Digest, and Approvals, you gladly accepted the challenge to improve feature adoption rates.  I appreciate your willingness to identify affected customers, to contact the program managers alerting them of the upcoming changes, and to work with our team to turn these features on.  With your dedication to this project, we've upgraded the majority of our SMB customers with the latest recognition features and you've built stronger relationships with them too.  Great job and thank you.\n\n363#GloboThanks- An Extraordinary Globoforce Tradition|Thank you so much for all of your work to help make our 2016 GloboThanks event such a huge success!! From decorating to food and table set-up to clean-up you helped to make sure that the event was fantastic and on time! It is no small task to feed 130 employees but we managed it as a team and I can't thank you enough for your help!!\n\n364#Training and on-boarding|Thank you, not only for the training you've given me thus far, but for the much more that you have mapped out on my training plan. I'll keep sponging it all up, and thank you for being there when I need a refresher.  Cheers!\n\n365#Incremental Influencer|Thanks to your fantastic job influencing SSOE Group to give a $100 award to all US employees for the holidays, we have added $110K in incremental revenue! This is more than their original allocation of $72K. Your approach to leading, nuturing and governing your SMB customers to trust you and your guidance, is evident in this success. Great job!\n\n366#Great Feedback from Customer SSOE|Judith - congratulations on the shout out that SSOE's program manager put onto their LinkedIn feed... \"Launched our new global recognition and reward program yesterday! BRAVO is offered through Globoforce! Kudos to our client success manager, Judith Colantuono! She has been a great partner to work with!\"   It was really great to hear one of our customers recognize your hard work getting them launched on our recognition platform, and I have to say that you've earned every bit of that praise! It was also great that our customer chose to mention your great work and Globoforce in her update.   Thank you for all the amazing things you do every day... you make working here great!\n\n367#Feeling at home|Judith, thank you for all that you have done for me over the past 6 weeks. From providing the fundamental tools needed to learn what being an LSM is all about, to the hands-on, ad hoc tasks you've sent my way. All of this has truly helped me ramp up and feel more comfortable with the day-to-day responsibilities. I feel like I've finally found my groove and place here, and you played a key part in that.\n\n368#Great feedback on deck for ROI project|Sometimes it's a challenge to present the recognition analytics project in an easy to understand way to our clients. Your feedback and ideas on a new intro deck were very helpful in overcoming some of those challenges. I think it will be much clearer now, what steps our clients can take to get started and who from their organizations to get involved!\n\n369#Wonderful Trainer!|Judith thank you for providing a group of us with snagit training when we were in Boston. The comprehensive overview & hands on approach has set us up for success & made some cumbersome tasks a lot more achievable! We really appreciate your time & the knowledge shared!\n\n370#Making our Customer Success Offsite GREAT!|Judith, I wanted to specifically call out your enormous contribution to our Customer Success offsite!  From hotel selection options to site visits, to hotel contract negotiations to logistics management on-site, including a great and varied menu catering to all healthy desires (with a little bit of naughty thrown in) and ensuring every I was dotted and t was crossed!  Thank you!  It was amazing to have you to count on for all these details.  The day was a resounding success and much of it was down to your excellence in planning and execution!  Well done and thank you!\n\n371#SMB and Customer Success Overview|Judith, this is a shout out for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with RFP Team last week. I want to thank you for going into a deep dive into the SMB process along with answering questions regarding other Customer Success processes. It was an informative meeting and my team was so thankful on how you deal with the various customer requests day-in and day-out. You're a great ambassador for the Customer Success Team and Globoforce. Thank you again- Michael\n\n372#SMB updates|Judith, thanks for your endless help in getting the Smb clients up to date. You continue to update me every week via Skype to make sure client profiles and points are up to date. I really value your input and continued help. Thanks very much and enjoy.\n\n373#Customer Success Newbie Training|Judith, now that our training is winding down, I wanted to say thank you for everything you have done to get me up and running at Globoforce! Since day one, you have been here to show me around, introduce me to everyone, set up all of my training, get all of my systems up and running, and more. Thank you so much for all of this and your continued support!!!!\n\n374#Corning Coverage Queen|Thank you so much for covering Corning while I was on PTO.  They were thrilled when I told them it was going to be you who would be participating in the daily testing calls.  You clearly established a great trust with them from your prior interactions.  I definitely would not have been able to relax on the beach if it weren't for you! I knew that you could handle anything that came up with the payroll files, data files and testing.  You are a great team player.  I owe you :)\n\n375#Amazing first three weeks!|Great Start!  Launch Team – Thank you SO much for the incredible first three weeks. The way you all have welcomed me to the team has been a wonderful experience. I am extremely happy with my choice to join the Globoforce family and even happier to have landed with such a great group of people.  Christine – Thank you for taking the time to guide me through the everyday life at Globoforce as well as some wildly complex launches. You have made me feel so comfortable and your support and encouragement continues to increase my excitement for this role.  Judith – Thank you for the scheduling, site training, password setup, resource setup, Dublin setup… I could keep going but I think we might run out of space. Thank you for EVERYTHING you’ve done over the past few weeks!  Erin – Thank you for including me in everything from client calls to group lunches.  Additionally, thank you for fielding my endless questions on the various systems. I am continually impressed on how calm, cool and collected you are in everything you do.  Rich – Thank you for all the documentation and data you’ve shared with me. Since we are both “data guys” you know how helpful this is in my on-boarding process. Also, thank you for asking for my thought on things. That small act has made me feel valued right from the start.    Rick – Thank you for the quiet guidance. Anytime I’ve got a question you are always smiling and willing to help.   I really appreciate everything this team has done! I know on-boarding someone new isn’t the easiest thing to accommodate, you have all made it awesome.\n\n376#Lilly Visit|Thank you very much all of your support over the past few days with the Lilly visit. It was a huge success and I have you all to thank for it. I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to support me. I think we can all agree that I am not one for planning  and entertaining so without your help we may well have been feeding our guests peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ;) I am so lucky to have people like you to work with. Thanks again!!\n\n377#Cool, calm and collected|Judith, you are cool as a cucumber.  You're working with a client who had an unusually long contract process and has been difficult at times and short with their responses during our meetings.  It's not easy and you've been nothing but professional, positive and helping them reach a quick launch time frame.  With your lead, I hope we can turn their frown upside down and launch another successful program.  Keep up the great work and great attitude.\n\n378#Keeper of the Corner|Judith! This is LONG OVERDUE recognition for all of the thousands (literally) of questions, issues and scenarios the coordinators have come to you with on a daily basis. At first I didn't realize just how valuable it would be to have you over in our little corner to help with these types of things, but now I don't know how we could ever live without it! Thank you for always being so patient with the multitude of asks and for always having the answer (or pointing us in the right direction if you don't!!). It has been SO helpful to have you over here and I am grateful that we have all become a little corner-family. THANK YOU from the corner kids!!!!\n\n379#SMB|Judith, this is long overdue, but I just want to say thanks so much for your time and patients getting the clients up to set up and up to date with points. Your help is much appreciated, thank you.\n\n380#CSM Training|I can't thank Judith enough for putting together my CSM New Hire Training. Between scheduling and re-scheduling my last two weeks, personally training me herself as well as being a tremendous resource for me these past couple weeks I don't know how she does it all. Thank you so much!\n\n381#Jumping in feet first!|Judith, Right before a training session last week, I received word that the client's stakeholder had something urgent come up and would NOT be joining the training and available for questions.  w-h-a-t?  You tag-teamed the training session with me and helped me lead a fantastic session. I'd imagine that most people didn't even know that you work for Globoforce!  Thank you for the support and your smooth approach.  Your background in training employees really shined through!\n\n382#Unum Account Review|Judith, in honor of Respect for Customers, great job preparing a meaningful day with Unum!  The data you pulled was spot on and this years review was great.  I think all the work you did lead to impactful dialog and enthusiasm for how we an continue to make recognition even more meaningful for employees at Unum.  We have great momentum going into the rest of 2016 to create change for the better.  Way to go!\n\n383#2016 WH Customer Panel|Thank you so much for your instrumental help in getting VP-level contacts at our key customers to participate in the Customer Panel at WorkHuman 2016.  Your efforts and relationship-building skills will help to make the event more interesting, will enable us to build stronger relationships with these key customers and will ensure that all the others in attendance will get to hear about the benefits delivered by some of the best recognition programs in the world.  Great work!\n\n384#Stepping in halfway through a migration|Hi Judith, a quick congrats on another great migration. This was my most troublesome one yet, as the incident didn't help most things regarding permissions and tools. Yet - we made it in the end, overcoming plenty of obstacles in the way. Even better for yourself was the way to seamlessly took the client over from Kristen. It was if you knew the client since Day 1.\n\n385#Securing a client for WorkHuman panel!|Judith - Great job securing one of our SMB clients, Kelly Poulson from Allen & Gerritsen, for our customer panel at WorkHuman.  This is critical representation up on stage for the non-enterprise size folks in the audience.  It was clear from her exchanges with you how excited she was by the opportunity.  It was also clear how strong of a relationship you have built with her!   She is going to be a dynamite addition and everyone who touches WorkHuman thanks you!  Kevin\n\n386#DHL-Speedy Delivery|Judith!  Wow, you went way above and beyond to make the DHL migration happen.  You worked weekends, late and squeezed out some other priorities to make this client happy.  You truly did a great job & helped to get this client back on track and loving Globoforce again.  Your patience and persistence were unwavering through this whole process from beginning to end.  Thank you immensely for all of your hard work and dedication!  I'm so proud to get to work along side you!\n\n387#Thank You!!|Hey Judith! I just wanted to say thank you for all your help with Brother and DHL. They are the first clients I have really worked on and you've been such a great help. You are always so fast at getting back to me with any questions I have which makes my work so much easier and faster. Thank You! =D\n\n388#Many hands make light work|Guys, I just wanted to thank you all on behalf of the branding team for the incredible amount of work you've all been putting in over the past couple of months. It's been a busy time with a lot of new and current clients (DHL, Brother, Lilly, Dunkin, BMS, Avanade, Alere, Atlanticare, Informatica, Air Products, KPMG and possibly more that I have forgotten!) and you've been such great team players. The work we see is only part of what you do but between scheduling calls, consolidating feedback, obtaining various designs assets, setting expectations for our clients, and basically keeping the ball rolling on numerous projects, we want to say THANK YOU!\n\n389#New hire onboarding|Judith,  thank you for all your help in my first few weeks at Globoforce.  From scheduling various training and orientation sessions to creating the Customer Success Onboarding Guide, you have been such a great help in getting up to speed on everything.  You've made the onboarding experience a very helpful and well organized process.   Thanks again, Jay.\n\n390#Otsuka Rask|One of Otsuka Pharmaceutical's core values is Jissho-Shugi: Reflecting their Japanese heritage, this term means, “Prove yourself, and earn larger opportunity.” This is extremely fitting for this deal because you all proved that selling at Globoforce is all about teamwork. Together we earned this opportunity and I can not thank you enough for all your efforts.\n\n391#Eaton Timelines|Thanks for your help with the Eaton push live. We cut it pretty close but you all did your part to make it happen. It's nice to work with such a great team!!\n\n392#On top of your accounts!|Judith,  When you heard that Orbitz was being acquired by Expedia, you decided to take initiative and collaborate with me regarding my prospecting work with Expedia. As it happens, we just had a meeting with Expedia. The next step we took was you coordinated a call for Todd and me with your program manager (Dir of Comp) at Orbitz. It was such a productive and timely call. We now have the opportunity to 1) keep a client who was just acquired and 2) Have the parent adopt an enterprise wide solution, which will exponentially expand the business and impact of the current program. Fantastic work, thanks for being proactive and working with sales on this, we're excited!\n\n393#Customer Innovation|Judith, Steve and Steve, thank you for all the insights and ideas each of you provided today as we worked to configure the MoodTracker Surveys for our SMB customers. As we discovered, there are many factors that had to be reviewed and discussed before we could make a final decision on providing the best service for our customers. With everyone's determination, we worked through all the configuration options imaginable to create an innovative way to deliver the surveys. I am excited to see the results as employees begin to take the surveys.\n\n394#Language Detective|Judes, thank you so much for helping me log in as a German user and identify an issue we have been having with our merchandise translations. You were so quick to log in as another user so I could validate that there was an issue (since I don't have the direct access to client sites). Thanks to your help, customers will now be able to see the merchandise descriptions properly laid out in their native language. Thank you so much for your help!
