"0#Excellence in Action|As we wrap up Q3, I want to take a moment to celebrate a group of outstanding humans who have created incredible momentum across the business. This quarter you've shown what it means to have Respect for Quality - working across teams, delivering high-quality work, all while staying focused on what matters most: our mission to make work human. Your commitment to Inspire the HR Industry has shone through in the many accomplishments across the organization. As we head into the final quarter of the year, I’m filled with optimism about what we’ll continue to achieve together. Thank you for your hard work, your passion, and your commitment!\n\n1#Sanofi Long Game Pays Off!|A Quote from our SCD and Team Porfolio Review on 8/20 that is no doubt a recognition moment! to be celebrated:   \"Sanofi is the story of resilience, patience, consistency and playing the long game. Great leadership from Samar and brilliant Sanofi team with Tracey, Jose, Julian, and our extended team of awesome folks\"   How far this account has come and Kudo's to the amazing teamwork, collaboration and passion for the impact of recognition.  Your belief in our product and how you articulate it to our clients does indeed drive great outcomes!\n\n2#Strategic Leadership at its Finest!|Samar – You are truly an inspiration! The strategic leadership, professionalism, and dedication you displayed during the preparation and execution of Merck’s and Cytiva’s in-person Business Reviews was impressive. You provided clear direction on content, strategic messaging, expectations, and anticipated outcomes. You focused on strengthening relationships with executive leadership by ensuring that for Cytiva, Derek O’Sullivan, VP of HR and Executive Sponsor for Cytiva, and Sarah Whitman, Executive Sponsor for Workhuman, were both in attendance. This provided an opportunity to make the in-person introduction, cultivate and elevate the partnership, and provide for an even greater opportunity for future expansion. During the review, Derek was instrumental in moving many initiatives forward for Cytiva, including the launch of the HI Culture Hub that went live in June. For Merck, you ensured that Jeff Geller, SVP of Global Rewards & HR Operations, an advocate for Workhuman, and a connection to CHRO Betty Larson, was present. Jeff was highly engaged in the robust discussion around the potential negative impact the recent spend restrictions are having, and the importance of a strategic plan to encourage increased program usage and engagement to avoid future culture decay. The working session that took place directly after the Merck review was a homerun. It was well received by the Merck team, and it facilitated the first steps in kicking off our upcoming strategic initiatives. Both Business Reviews were a tremendous success, and one of the highlights for me was that we went into both with 3 carefully crafted, anticipated next steps, and we’ve already acted on each of them. Thank you for always being an amazing partner and thank you for all that you do each day to move our clients forward. As an organization, we are fortunate to have you!\n\n3#And Wait. . . There is More!|Caitlin, Christina, Dave, Janet, Marie, Mike, Samar and Susan,  Taking on more when there is already more that has been asked of you, is never what anyone wants to hear or have to do, yet each and everyone of you rose to the occasion of adding an account to your portfolio.  What is so impressive is the grace and can do lens you approached this addition to your book of business at the mid year.   I appreciate how you are quick to act and own the account, partner with the CSM's, get meetings on the books, step into an account review that was already on the books with minimal notice, take over strategic initiatives already in play and most importantly show your level of business acumen for getting up to speed and driving strategy in a swift manner.  Thank you team!!\n\n4#New Values Milestone|Thank you to each of you for the role you played in the launch of the new values and the award to all Sanofians this week to mark the launch of their new Values for Take the Lead.  They were launched during a Global Town Hall and then an award was sent to all employees to mark this milestone.  This has been many weeks in the making and the discussions with the core team were pivotal to having an award issued from the CHRO to mark this rollout, thank you Tracey, Lynette and Samar for your resilience and determination in advocating and demonstrating how Bravo! can support such significant company announcements and supporting the launch of the new values.  Kevin thank you for leading the technical charge, you & Tracey's collaboration has been fantastic.  The last line of the award was \"Bravo! is our first activation, I hope this note will also inspire you to share the love!\" The teamwork and collaboration on this was excellent, thank you for working and supporting each other to make this happen, great work!\n\n5#Welcoming with a wow!|Samar, you're always thinking about the experience for our customers. When onboarding Brennan, our new PM at Merck, the idea came up to build a curated experience for him and integrate it with the PM Learning Lab in Framingham - and we delivered! The workshop was incredibly well-executed, providing Brennan with essential information to take back to Merck and positioning us as a true partner as he takes the reins. It was such a game changer that our presentation and experience is now an essential part of my toolkit as I work with other teams to onboard new PMs. Thanks for always being forward-thinking, detail-oriented, stepping up during key moments, and being a great partner.\n\n6#Portfolio Review Powerhouses|SCD Team, Sheri and I would like to take a moment to express our deepest appreciation and recognition for the incredible effort our team has put into the Portfolio Reviews and Account Plans. Your dedication, thoughtfulness, and passion have truly set us on a path to success for this year.  The commitment to excellence showed in every detail of the plans you have crafted, yes the colorful White Space is still a fan favorite!  Time and energy invested is evident, does not go unnoticed, and we are genuinely grateful for the hard work each one of you has contributed. It is your collective vision and perseverance that will drive us forward and ensure we achieve our goals.  Let's continue to build on this momentum and make this year a remarkable success!\n\n7#Renewal Takeover!|Congratulations Samar and team for bringing Pfizer over the finish line for not 3 years, but a 5 year renewal!  Samar assumed responsibility for the account in August, where she uncovered risks surrounding the renewal for 2025.   She worked with leadership to align on a strategy and develop a plan.  Alyssa and Tom dove in alongside her to not only get us realigned but positioned to win this RFI.  No renewal comes to fruition without the attention and care from the CSM or the  guidance from our consultancy practice.  Many thanks to Tim, Shelly, Melanie and Jessica for being on the Pfizer journey.  This win is a great example of collaboration along with the teams consistent and creative approaches which created confidence in the Pfizer team to entrust Workhuman for another 5 years.\n\n8#Sanofi Partnership & Leadership Excellence|Samar, my sincerest thanks and appreciation for you and your involvement with Sanofi. To say it's not an easy client... emotionally, mentally, or any other way... But you are IN IT with Tracey and me all the way. From day 1 of you joining the Sanofi account, you stepped in and stepped UP to help us across the board. You willingly take on the hard conversations, think creatively to support their needs (always with a business mindset to be sure WH is well served), and generally help coordinate the full WH team delivering for Sanofi. Just one example of what you do in your SCD role that I personally greatly appreciate - account review coordination and prep. You do all the right things to kick off our internal prep early - across all the various WH teams, set up the deck, schedule review and prep meetings, and make sure all of us (and that's a lot of folk) are all well prepared and coordinated with each other to deliver impactful reviews (even in incredibly tight time slots). This is no 'little thing' - but can get lost in all the other activity you're managing for Sanofi. We appreciate YOU and your partnership spirit so much. Thank you!\n\n9#Merck Strategy Deck|Great work on the Merck strategy deck.  We are navigating through some challenges in Merck's business causes a reduction in the INSPIRE program, but this team has been incredibly diligent and thoughtful in supporting Merck through this change in their program and thinking through how we strategically rebuild  the business case by showing the value INSPIRE has delivered over the years to support reinstating the budget.  We have a ways to go, but this team had shown the dedication to get us there.\n\n10#You're Killin' It!|Samar - I wanted to take a moment to recognize you and all that you are. Over the last six months, I've watched you navigate a delicate relationship and a challenging journey with Merck. I've watched you work tireless hours, ask the tough questions, and have some difficult conversations. I've admired your passion, your drive, and your determination to succeed. You're fierce! Going into 2025, you've got this! Thanks for being you and thanks for being such a great partner!\n\n11#Celebrate J&J for their Celebrations Add-On!|Team, I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for all of the hard work you've put into the re-Launch of the JnJ Inspire program with the addition of Life Events, Community Celebrations, and the Automated Welcome Award! This project went quickly and smoothly, due to the vast J&J experience of folks on the core team, and quick action from all! Tim, Kara, and Samar, thank you so much for bringing your great relationship with the PM Linda to the table, as well as your wealth of J&J knowledge. Any time I had a question during this post-launch project, I knew I could rely on you three to help out.

You have been thorough in your recaps so we are aware of current status', you are transparent and timely in communicating areas where gaps exists and you get the right people in the room to facilitate decision making and next steps expediently.  Appreciate the focus on creating urgency where and when it matters.\n\n14#Helping customers achieve program excellence|Congratulations on last week’s successful execution of the latest installment of the Workhuman Program Excellence Workshop Series – Connecting Your Recognition Data to Strategic Priorities. Traci and Samar, thank you for leveraging your strong relationship with Christopher at Merck and bringing not only the informative content but also the energy to your superb presentation. Luke, Jenn, Anastasia, and Sarah, we couldn’t have brought this learning opportunity to our customers without your behind-the-scenes support, so thank you for seamlessly putting our best foot forward by handling the tech nuts & bolts, garnering customer registrations, wordsmithing and copy editing, and giving assets that Workhuman design shine. Through your collective efforts, we had 42 accounts participate and an above-benchmark 44% attendance rate with customers commenting “Merck’s story was great!”; “I liked hearing it directly from a customer.”; and “This workshop reiterates all of the great things about this program and the social and wellbeing aspect of recognition.” To top it off, customers enjoyed the session so much that 9.6/10 said they’d attend a future workshop! It doesn’t get much better than that, so thank you, all, for your utmost respect for customers!\n\n15#Grateful for your dedication to our clients|Marie, Samar & Paul - It's amazing to see your dedication to our clients and unwavering commitment to demonstrating our value through the lens of what is most important to them.  Thank you for your creative problem solving and tenacity. I also appreciate your willingness to help me get up to speed on WH over the last few months. I’m grateful to have you on our team and appreciate all you do!\n\n16#Playing to Win at Sanofi|Samar, Congratulations on a successful first annual account review with Sanofi!  You’ve literally taken this client 5 weeks ago, and you’ve just jumped straight in. Your thorough preparation and planning working towards this meeting ensured we were all well-prepped for the day. On the day you led us through and ensured from the beginning the client team had our key takeways/recommendations in mind as we went through the meeting. Overall it was a positive day and clearly well received by the client. Lot's to do but it's exciting!  Securing a regular touch base with Michel going forward is a commendable achievement—kudos! It has been quiet the journey with Sanofi so far, delighted that you are onboard for Bravo 2.0, thanks Samar\n\n17#Successful Invest Segment QBR|I wanted to thank each and every one of you for your focus and commitment to our first ever Invest segment QBR!  The collaboration and sharing of ideas to help move the business forward and outline some key takeaways to action towards increased investment was fantastic.  The commitment to our customers and their needs is very apparent in each of your spirits and how you show up for them daily and internally at Workhuman.  We recognize the change in focus and alignment into the segments may take a little longer to smooth completely out, but the commitment to each other and the needs of the business to grow were evident in how each of you showed up.  We want to continue the great momentum as we finish out H1 and head into H2.  Thank you for inspiring me as a leader and for the dedication and focus that is needed as we move forward to making 2024 an incredible year.  Way to go Invest team!\n\n18#Strategy at it's finest!|You all delivered and INCREDIBLE strategy meeting at Merck!  Christopher Cardarelli shared that for the newer program team to feel comfortable investing at the same levels, they needed new data to support the impact Inspire was having across the business.  I had a front row seat to all the preparation sessions to drive to the right data, the best storytelling to help them understand the impact the program is having across the business and where great was happening along with where it wasn’t.  Melissa Liguori, Global Compensation Leader/Program Owner, was completely engaged from moment one.  She was so excited about what she saw that she wanted to include the head of Analytics and the Head of Talent moving forward.  She is excited for us to develop the story to take to the new CHRO, Betty Larson about the impact of Inspire.  This meeting gained great momentum and we have excitement from them to continue onto another communication session to continue to drive engagement where it is lacking and keep excitement high across the business.  It takes a well-designed strategy to keep our largest customer engaged and continuing to move the ball forward to keep investment high and commitment at the highest level, remarkable job Samar.  Greg, the new insights, and approach to the data sets was so well received and really pulled them in – loved seeing how they caught onto the fact that HR has a real opportunity to increase their recognition strategy within their own team.  Jason, great job helping them to see the future of where reporting is going and piquing their curiosity and excitement.  Mark, you did a great job at helping them to see how they are preforming today, and your thorough knowledge of their program is unmatched.  Danielle and Jessica, while your communication strategy session is yet to come, it was apparent through the meeting that you all had prepared a best practice approach and peppered in some really essential gems of inspiration.  Great job team!\n\n19#Inspiring with JNJ & Merck|Samar - Wow, what an incredible WHLive you created not only for Linda Pedi at JNJ, but also for Christopher Cardarelli at Merck.  You did a phenomenal job partnering with Christopher and Traci Pesch on the Takeaway Thursday Session.  The session was so engaging and everyone there was dialed in and focused on learning.  Talking to Manulife after the session, they were so excited to take it back to the organization and leverage the learnings (inclusive of the puzzle) - that is the ultimate goal!   The relationship you continue to build across the team at Merck continues to solidify their trust and that is no easy task, and you make it look effortless.  Linda Pedi (Total Rewards Leader and PM) was thrilled to be there and expressed how much she loved the conference, but more importantly the partnership she has with you and Tim!  The fact that JNJ was the recipient of the Culture award is directly related to the incredible work you have done with them over the last three years.  I am so proud of the partnership you have created with your customers Samar!  Phenomenal job!\n\n20#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders.

I must say, I truly believe this negotiation was the longest in Workhuman history, spanning upwards of three years!  Samar, stepped right into this very challenging negotiation and in true Samar fashion, you dug in, met the team within a week, including the Executive Sponsor. I swear you have the Midas touch for turning around situations with customers that are extremely difficult in nature and making it look effortless.  The back and forth with Procurement in other countries was unrelenting and your perseverance was remarkable.  Tim, how about holding the Citi ship steady for years now and building such solid relationships and trust with the team there.

Thank you all for being such incredible humans!\n\n23#Sharing the J&J story|Samar, thanks so much for taking the time last week to connect internally and share all of the great work you are doing with J&J.  The story you shared proved helpful when I met with the Chief Employee Experience Officer at MetLife.  He and his boss (CHRO) both came from J&J.  Understanding our journey with J&J was immensely helpful and solidified Workhuman credibility.  Thanks for the great work you do every day with this important customer and thanks for sharing the story with me!\n\n24#2024 Off to a Great Start|All - What an incredible couple of days planning for our largest customers!

It has been a tremendous year full of lots of ups and downs, but you have given your all to our customers and I couldn’t be prouder of each of you.  This year has been the most challenging I can remember for Workhuman, but you never missed a beat in delivering growth, renewing our partnerships, and creating new opportunities that have set us up for success in 2024.

Thank you for the commitment you make each day to our customers, myself and Workhuman.  Cheers to your dedication and perseverance!\n\n26#Gratitude Soaring at Johnson & Johnson|Talk about improving others gratitude attitude, mental health, and wellbeing – you’re doing it for thousands! Our JNJ partnership and continuous building of executive relationships from the recent total rewards offsite is paying out big dividends. Samar, from day 1, you recognized the opportunity to bring JNJ executives together, to hear how the whole WH Cloud supports their talent and business outcomes, cultivating relationships with numerous key stakeholders from Kristen Mulholland, Head of Global Total Rewards; to Carolina Pena, Head of Employee Health, and Well-Being, to the Head of Global Comp and many more “Head of” at JNJ. These relationships have built tremendous TRUST in Workhuman to partner with JNJ on their strategic initiatives. The WHCP proposed a How Gratitude & Recognition Boost Well-Being series of webinars to support the robust campaign. JNJ said “Yes, let’s do it.” Traci, Corrine, Jessica, and Melissa created a customized GS session, integrating JNJ content, to align the session with JNJ’s messaging, coupled with WH’s for an incredible 30-minutes of energy, education, and the call to action to make recognition part of every day! Traci and Corinne, captivating audience, the first session had 4,100+ participants, 1,500+ chat messages, “reactions” of hearts, clapping and thumbs up throughout. The Asia Pac session delivered at 11:30pm ET had another 500 participants and lots of engagement. The first email about the GS was from Carolina Pena with the subject line “That was amazing!!!.” Then Kristen piled on saying Thank you everyone!  I attended the session and thought it was terrific!!  Well done! We’re awaiting the full report out on the impact of these two sessions and then the exclamation mark for World Mental Health Day is coming this October 10th when Peter Fasolo, Ph.D., CHRO sends out a WMHD award to all employees. A first in our partnership history!\n\n27#Driving Focus for Q4 & 2024|Team I wanted to thank you all for coming prepared to truly imagine where we take our largest customers next.  We spent the last couple of days ideating on how we can continue to grow investment, expand our buyers, elevate our thought leadership, and bring the best WH has to offer.  I appreciate all the thought you’re putting into each customer and the dedication to look beyond the obvious while also being there to have each other’s back.  Let’s keep the focus going to end the year strong and be prepared to go into 2024 more focused and proactive than ever before.  Cheers to this amazing group of fierce humans – I’m so incredible proud of each of you and feel so grateful to get to work alongside you every day!\n\n28#So Thankful for All of You!|In honor of World Gratitude Day, I am beyond Grateful for each of you!

Cheers to each of you!\n\n29#Putting the LIFE into Manulife!|Meisha-Ann, Samar and Mike, what a fantastic event you all brought to fruition with Jim Gallagher, the Chief Legal Officer/Employee Engagement Champion this week to take a bow on their month of Gratitude at Manulife.  While the road to the final destination was full of twists and turns, Meisha-Ann, you were an absolute pro at pivoting to get the content just right to the customers liking.  You had 200 Manulife employees eating out of the palm of your hand in person, and thousands more from a far across their different locations and virtually. Your Thrive Gallup Roundtable was the inspiration for them to bring you to the stage to co-present with their CLO for what was an engaging and inspiring session.  Your biggest fan turned out to Pam Kimmet, the CHRO who was clambering to meet one of this year’s Top 100 HR Tech Influencers,  Look out Drake and Rachel McAdams - fans were literally flocking to you all in the streets after the session to meet you and tell you how spectacular the experience was.  Samar, you have brought this customer to a place that we would have never thought possible in the beginning.  Your leadership and strategic vision were shining so bright here and you seized the opportunity to secure Workhuman a spot in the CHRO’s next Executive Offsite Strategy session in May of 2024.  You are masterful at maneuvering through tough to navigate global organizations and creating incredible executive relationships and making it look effortless.  To secure these kinds of opportunities for Workhuman, at an organization like Manulife is extremely challenging and I couldn’t be prouder.  Mike, from the moment you stepped into this customer relationship, you have been building the trust and confidence they so desperately needed. Your partnership and commitment to delivering excellence is exceptional and such a foundation for this relationship. Cheers to each of you and I can’t wait to see where this dynamic trio takes us next at Manulife.\n\n30#Killing it for Kenvue|Incredible work by all of you pulling together the response for the Kenvue RFP!  James, you consistently deliver and are an amazing partner as it comes to RFPs and this time was no exception.  You worked diligently (among several other RFPs and vacation) to pull everything together and get us all aligned to deliver our proposal. It is such a joy to get to partner with you and your positivity and calm approach are so grounding and appreciated.  Corinne, you jumped in to help (while also heading out on vacation) to truly deliver a great overarching story.  Your passion and commitment always shine through and your expertise and creativity delivered an amazing finished product.  Rebecca, you immediately jumped in to help and ensure we had all of the important details correctly captured, rounded out the story and made sure it was all executed with excellence and every detail spot on.

Your experience and historical knowledge kept us on par and delivering to what matters most to Kenvue.  Danielle, thank you for your partnership and leadership for all of the details around the program and the players. You have been so heavily involved with them and your insights made such a difference in making sure we were aligned with all of the right things.  Lauren, thank you for jumping in and taking the initiative to help and drive this forward.  Teamwork at it's finest right here!  Cheers to all of you.  I am confident we will all be heading to Skillman, NJ to finish off the renewed partnership in August.\n\n31#QBR- Driving Excellence for our Customers|Wow- I have to say a huge thank you to all of you for showing up to QBRs, bringing your best ideas, ideating together and continuing to push the envelope on what excellence looks like for our customers.  While I know we feel a bit in defense mode lately, all of you are still staying focused on how best to increase investments across our customers, create epic moments that deliver a truly special connection with Workhuman and elevating the conversations with Executives at our largest customers.  I know leading our largest customers is a big job, tons of responsibility and sometimes thankless, but I see you and all that you’re doing each and every day to bring the best to our customers and Workhuman.  I love having the time together to connect, learn from each other, laugh, celebrate our families and so much more. You all bring so much joy to me and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you do.  Cheers to each of you and I can’t wait to see our ideas come to life.\n\n32#JNJ Global Total Rewards Onsite - #GOINSPIRE|A HUGE congrats to you all on the massively successful JNJ Total Rewards meeting this week! This opportunity started with you, Samar. Your ability to pro-actively siege the opportunity to bring JNJ’s Total Rewards team’s offsite meeting to our Boston office and engage JNJ’s leadership team in new and exciting ways is truly impressive. Once secured, you lead the WH team, pulled in SMEs to speak, organized the two-days, skillfully planned every detail, and made the magical “ah ha” moments happen organically. Your strategic leadership changed the trajectory of this customer!   Traci and Corinne, you masterfully put together a proposal for what a JNJ TR onsite meeting could look & feel like, a detailed agenda with rich content, helped them visualize an immersive experience & all logistics. Meisha-Ann, Corinne and Traci, thank you for being inspiring speakers, sharing the power and impact of Gratitude, rooted in data and science and feelings. They were so engaged and even set a goal of moving from 28% nom reach to 40%, while building the business case to champion more investment - specifically 8 recognition moments per year and commitment to ongoing Inspire communications. Corinne, you took on extra duties in not only presenting a Gratitude Summit but worked with JNJ’s point contact, Adam Myer, to organize the second day of breakout sessions, built a framework for facilitation and decision making, to make this a productive session. Melissa, your superb design skills, bringing concepts to life in new ways, pre-organizing and drafting up the flip charts, putting together the breakout session “toolkits” for easy execution on the day made this one a diamond standard event! Kristen Mulholland, Head of TR repeatedly said this is EXACTLY what she wanted. I’m extremely confident that this incredible experience has catapulted our relationship with JNJ to new heights and will drive even greater success in the future!\n\n33#Amazing work to Support our largest Customers!|Wow, what a fantastic couple of days together!  SCDs, you showed up with dedication and fortitude to continue moving the ball forward at our largest customers.

The passion for striving to excellence is so apparent in your mindset at the work each of you are doing daily.  For those of you who joined us who are working alongside us to make the impossible possible, thank you!  Your partnership and determination to help deliver on the goals we all set together is beyond appreciated.  Each of you showed up, ready to listen, bring ideas to help support and grow our customers from each of your organizations.

Cheers and thanks to each of you!\n\n34#Wow Work for WHLive 2023!|Where to even start with the awesomeness this team brought to WHLive 2023!  You all inspired our largest customers to show up to WH Live in San Diego from across the globe (not just in the US, but from Europe and Asia).  Not only did they show up and advocate without question, but you also got them to speak, bring their teams and champion change at their organizations. I was beyond proud to see each of you hosting your customers with enthusiasm and spirit, helping them to understand the impact they can bring to their companies, laughing and building champions of Workhuman.  You played an integral part in creating the experience for them at Workhuman live.  I was pleased to see the partnership in helping to create experiences for those customers where colleagues couldn't be present.  I loved getting to hear first-hand from our largest customers about the partnerships you all have held for years in some cases and just a few months in other cases and how much it means to them as individuals and their organizations.  You all inspire me every day and the impact you're delivering to our customers makes all the difference.  Massive congratulations to all of you on a very successful WHLive 2023!\n\n35#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.

But in typical Samar fashion, you are simply unfazed, pragmatic and extremely positive.  There have been several challenges thrown your way with the JNJ renewal and the Kenvue spin off and you have managed it beautifully both with the customer and all of the internal players.  While this still has some work to go, with you at the helm, it will be successful without a doubt.  As a side job, you have been partnering with the sales team to help in selling into Jay's company HCL - talk about a power couple!  Thank you to you and Jay for supporting Workhuman and our teammates on the sales side.  The intel you have been able to provide has been critical.  It is so amazing to watch you work and it make it look effortless.  Cheers to you Samar!  And one last thing... \"poe-tah-toe\"\n\n43#Excellence at Its Best!|I'm extremely proud of the determination you exemplified in our QBR session this week!  The profound dedication demonstrated across this team to outline and map how we can continue to deliver excellence to our customers was nothing short of incredible.  You all brought your biggest opportunities to the table to discuss how we can move them forward and identified what hurdles we need to overcome to bring them to fruition across the business.  I am always in awe to see how this group shows up for each other, helps to stretch each other’s thinking, helps to set a path towards achieving and exceeding what we need to deliver to our customers and to Workhuman.  Thank you all for your commitment to finish 2022 strong, while setting the bar high for 2023!\n\n44#Season of Giving Your All|This past week, all of you came together to share in the commitment to our customers, our company and each other!  It was so inspiring to see each and every one of you show up with passion and a desire to collectively learn from each other.  We spent time building momentum around how we unlock doors with executives, gaining full adoption of the Workhuman cloud, reaching new users on the platform, increasing investment and renewing our vows with longstanding customers.  The engagement that I saw when we discussed the roles everyone plays in supporting our customers, how you partner together and the achievements that have come from those partnerships was profound.  As we often hear, it takes a village - well I'm so PROUD to be a part of this village.  The commitment demonstrated in these sessions together is what makes us great and will continue to lead us into a bright 2023, no matter the challenges, we have each other!  In the spirit of the season of giving, thank you for giving it your all.  I look forward to more time together and a huge cheers to all of you!\n\n45#JNJ Marathon is Complete|Samar - Tremendous job getting the JNJ Contract renewed!  I know that this one felt like a marathon, but in true Samar fashion, you handled it all with the utmost of grace and professionalism.  There have been so many tricky moving parts with the Consumer Spinoff and keeping JNJ happy and moving forward in a strategic way.  You are just masterful in keeping it all running smoothly and I am beyond proud of your work.  Phenomenal delivery Samar!\n\n46#Abbott Excellence + WH Excellence = POWERFUL|What happens when Abbott Excellence + Workhuman Excellence collide? Magical, powerful, impactful things!! Samar, you took your strategy wand and waved it in front of the Abbott senior leadership team and now one thing leads to another!! Sing it - one thing, leads to another! The momentum you have created at Abbott in like being on the top of a rollercoaster, coming down the first hill, all passengers waving arms in the arm and feeling the rush of energy and excitement. Month after month, week after week, the AEA program is being infused throughout the world. Jessica, you have been my co-pilot on Abbott for many months and just an absolute rock of a partner! Your communication, presentation, leadership, command of a diverse audience is superb! On two days, yes only two days notice, you co-hosted the Abbott Gratitude Summit KSA groups session at 6am ET. Look at all those captivating faces on the screen. 250+ participants on the phone and numerous ones in conference rooms. Talk about making an impact! Amani Aljuaid, Head of HR, posted the experience all over Linkedin. Erika and Melissa, everything you touch turns to gold. The Gratitude Summits, the Abbott virtual benefits fairs, all of the organizing, tweaking, fine tuning of talking points, chasing down contacts and immediate responses is beyond excellent and incredible. I don't know how this team does everything you do without missing a beat! It's performance excellence in action, every day. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work alongside each and every one of you. #grateful #gamechangers, #you rock\n\n47#So Grateful for all of You!|I can’t even begin to put into words how fortunate I feel to get to work with this incredibly talented group of amazing humans!

Thank you each for bringing your very thorough and thoughtful action plans along with ‘visual aids’ to share over the last 2 lonnnnng dayz! We focused on what you’ve identified for the final few months of 2022 and it was incredible to hear about your progress and your dream scenarios.

Thank you for being uniquely you and for the contributions you bring to our customers and Workhuman.  Bravo!\n\n50#EATON E-STAR Program Review Success!|I want to thank everyone involved for their time, dedication and collaboration in making EATON's E-STAR program review a success --- the team members that were on-site at the EATON headquarters, as well as those who participated remotely. Together we successfully delivered program opportunities, meaningful and actionable data analysis, communication plans, and more!  The EATON team was highly engaged and this was a phenomenal way to kick off our relationship with the new program manager. And we can't forget a special shoutout to Traci, our personal Cleveland tour guide and Uber driver! I feel so fortunate to work with such a dynamic and passionate team.\n\n51#Celebration Milestones at Eaton!|This ROCKS!! A huge thank you to this incredible team for all the preparation and execution to make the recent onsite Account Review and Strategy meeting at Eaton a 'first' again post-pandemic! All the feels of getting more human with our customers. The welcome handshakes turned to hugs by the end of the meeting, the joy of seeing each other in person, the laughter, the real dialogue, the connections, the actions to move forward together - just an amazing and inspiring session. Samar, kicking us off, helping us celebrate the new program manager, Monica Jackson's speaking gig at WH Live, and all that's planned around peer to peer with monetary value, inclusion advisor, and program investment. Plus, inspiring through recent HR trends, Gallup survey and how recognition supports all of their talent and business goals. Tony, you have taken the reigns and are making a tremendous impact on Jessica Fugate. She said more than once in the meeting how great it is to work with you, your responsiveness, teaching her along the way, and setting her up for success in her new role. Amazing job! Greg, the data always is a highlight and allows the Eaton team to continue to push for forward change and build business cases. Corinne, the value creator calculator was played very feel and left Dee thinking about how Eaton could push beyond showing program metrics only as on or over budget and talk more deeply about the impact. Jessica and Erika, the stellar ongoing comms plan, the \"why's\" and messaging, how to leverage E-STAR as a key communication hub, and the weekly interactions with the Eaton team, have us set-up for program growth and sustainability. Nuvs and Adam, the Eaton team was keen to understand what's next, future technology, making recognition easier and even though it was a \"speed dating\" type of review, Dee's interested in learning more. Creating another 'first' with a customer onsite meeting with so many more to follow. #YOU ROCK, #THIS TEAM ROCKS!!\n\n52#The BEST strategy starts with Samar!|Samar!! Samar!! You are living this legendary quote \"A delighted and inspired customer is the best customer strategy of them all!\" You truly showed your grit, determination, innovative mindset and spearheaded a more strategic approach, vision and tactics for the AbbVie and J&J account reviews this past week! From organizing the story flow in a very prescriptive way to allow all subject matters experts in their respective disciplines to communicate in a way that provided exceptional moments of insight for the customer and transformed their thinking! Really digging in to move the needle! There were countless \"ah ha\" moments during each session and iteration from the customers around how important social recognition is to their talent outcomes and business goals. You orchestrated the \"why\", \"what\" and \"how\" perfectly. You lead the \"why\" discussions flawlessly. Why is social recognition critically important now more than ever, the impact it has in today's workplace, with so many changes, employees feeling burned out, stressed and it's the multi-dimensional gem all companies who are thriving are leaning hard in to. All of your statements then backed with customer and industry evidence based data! WHiQ then illustrating the \"what\" are the results the program is having today and the opportunities ahead, to the \"how\" do you show quantifiable ROI to your executives, increase recognition frequency, maximize investment and employee experience! You chased down every stat, detail, and chart needed to paint the perfect picture and inspire our customers!  Every day of the week you're thinking deeply about what's next for our top customers, how to get there and serve as such an incredible strategic partner building, growing and sustaining relationships and programs. You make every interaction count, big or small, and show us all what a high performer and visionary is. YOU ROCK!!\n\n53#It takes a Workhuman village! (part 2)|Last week was the culmination of the efforts by so many to bring the Executive Forum to life at Workhuman Live. Joining the team only 6 weeks before the event, I was blown away by the work ethic, camaraderie, and creativity of everyone involved. Your support, encouragement, and tireless commitment to the finished product (both during the final stretch of planning and onsite) far exceeded anything I could have ever imagined in a team, and your efforts were instrumental in delivering an impactful program for ExF members. Thank you for bringing the vision to life. It was a sincere pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.  With the craziness of the event, I fell a bit behind with recognition in the final 2 weeks leading up to the event. Please know - your contributions did not go unnoticed.   SCDs and Sales Teams – for your diligent efforts to fill the room and empower the most important Customers and Prospects to join the conversation. These efforts not only contributed to the success of this event, they also helped lay the foundation for future events and further development of our business relationships.   Meghan, Chris W, and Dave – for your diligent work facilitating and tracking customer experience and the growth account participation. I appreciate your keen eyes on the process!   Corina and Dana – for your collaborative efforts in integrating the Partner Program elements into the ExF experience and for your timely action in helping to lock in details ahead of our internal deadlines. Also, for your leadership and companionship as co-hosts of the Bellyard breakfasts and enthusiasm throughout the onsite experience. Your input during the breakfast conversations added real value to the attendees’ experiences. It was a delight to watch you in action!  With tremendous thanks for your involvement and contribution to this process – congratulations on a job well done! Onward to Dublin!\n\n54#Thinking Big!|Team, this is a long overdue recognition for our presentation given to Manulife to support their multiple programs.  They are a client that likes to challenge us to be better.  This was an example of us challenging them to do more with their program and you hit a home run.  Manulife simply asked us to demo how an ERG sub program would look.  We could have done just that and been fine.  But we went to a new level.  From Employee Resource Groups, to celebrating New Hires, to Learning & Development awards, to celebrating certain times of the year with campaigns, and more.  We showed them everything to embrace the power of their people.  Jessica, Lisa is still talking about the demo you gave. She described it on our call yesterday – Manulife came in with one idea and you totally blew them away with all the possibilities (insert head exploding gif).  Jessica and Traci, thank you for always thinking big!  Melissa, thank you for your help with the presentation deck and helping us create a story through powerful visuals.  Samar, thank you for being the glue that has held this all together over the past 2 years.  I’m lucky to partner with you all and I look forward to bringing these programs to life!\n\n55#Setting the Stage Like a Pro|To our amazing group of humans who took the stage to announce each WHL breakout speaker - BRAVO!!! This role required poise, prep, guts (especially for anyone not used to big audience public speaking), and energy - engaging the audience and setting the stage for the speaker talent. No small feat! Amy kicked us off by introducing Priya Parker on Monday afternoon and when her heel stuck in the stage floor, she handled it like the pro that she is and showed us all \"how it's done\" with grace and humanity. Everyone truly stepped up (yes, pun intended) for last-minute fill-ins when needed, seizing new opportunities and rising to the occasion. Thank you all for your collaboration and flexibility, and for truly making the breakout experience so phenomenal!\n\n56#WHL Strategic Accounts Team Success|HOTLANTA! Well done to this team of fabulous people! We got to reunite with old friends, new friends, and each other! You worked tirelessly to get the right customers to attend and really engage with us and it really paid off. I was so proud watching you all connect with our customers and see how proud they were to be hosted by you! Each of the customer speaking sessions was FAB! Mike Malloy could hardly contain himself—he may want a fulltime gig! Even GE was beaming! So many customers from so many accounts—many first timers! You all worked your tails off to be sure every customer felt great about their experience and managed to unearth some new insights and opportunities! Well done to each of you and to this fantastic team. You show up for each other and for customers in the very best way…every time. Cheers!!\n\n57#Quality is key!|I wanted to thank you all for your help in providing honest/ constructive feedback on our global account marketing materials. As we move into Q2, its important that we continue working as a team to create materials that provide the most value to our customers. Thank you for your continued partnership!\n\n58#Q1 QBRs: a Fresh New Year!|A 2 week-er! As we 'wrap up' QBRs for the first quarter of 2022, I want to thank you for your deep discovery work and preparation. We started with a week long deep dive account by account to get us all level set on our current footing. It was a very intense week and I so appreciate you all being so prepared and professional! We then gathered in my city by the Bay for another few days of collaboration, ideation, and BIG idea sharing. What a fantastic few days! Thank you for your commitment to this process, for showing up with your whole selves, for being supportive and encouraging of each other, and for making me laugh so much. I'm so proud of the work we're doing together and always SO happy to see you all in person. (I'm also super grateful that Erika's house is Covid-free! We missed your presence physically but we felt your presence virtually!) Safe travels home and happy weekend! #bestteamevah\n\n59#The BEST team on the Planet!|You all are a team of fierce, focused and determined humans!  I am so thankful to have a front row seat to watch you pouring your heart into all that you do to support our customers and grow the business for Workhuman.  Each of you inspires me beyond measure.  The work you all do everyday is challenging and hard and you make it look effortless.  You are truly moving mountains and I couldn't be more proud of you all. Thank you for being uniquely you!\n\n60#Celebrating HARMAN's 5th Anniversary|A huge thank you to this team for taking the time to participate in the 5th anniversary celebration of HARMAN's Be Brilliant program! You all took time out of your busy schedules to contribute a video to mark this special moment and the video will be delivered today to the HARMAN team. A lot of changes over at HARMAN has left them needing a big hug and this is the perfect way to show them how grateful we are for their partnership.  Thanks so much for your dedication to our customers!!\n\n61#Creating the POSSIBLE for Podium!|Wait!! What?? Do you see all the smiling faces on the Manulife team?? Let's all pinch ourselves now! Samar, Michael, Alan, Nuvs, Adam, Corinne, Jessica, Lauren and Melissa F please rise and go to the Podium to accept this recognition moment for turning the phrase \"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says I'm possible\" and you brought this to life at Manulife! Early on things seemed a bit impossible. Samar, from the moment you took over this account, you got stuck right into a \"bumpy\" ride. You eagerly took the reigns to turn around the partnership, some of their \"opportunities\" and built strong relationships, gained their trust, owned getting timely responses and brought this customer full circle from $4M to $9M. Michael, your amazing customer strategy and support has stood tall, it's obvious the relationships you have built too, vision and support for Manulife's success and the friendly, warm banter that's now part of the norm to calls with the team. Alan, the analysis you did on the Podium clearly illustrated the point the culture looks like a hockey stick with 40% of the recognition moments happening in December. You brought insights and recommendations on how to smooth this out, and truly build a culture of every day recognition. A desire Manulife has to support the HR strategy of \"excel at getting talent we need .. and keep the talent we want.\" Nuvs and Adam, amazing job sharing WH's innovations, the roadmap, what's next and why it matters. The team was hanging on your every word, super engaged and delighted to see where WH is going from a product standpoint. Jessica, Lauren and Corinne, the ongoing comms strategy, continued delivery on Gratitude Summits and inclusion advisor didn't disappoint! Lots of smiling faces. Melissa F, you brought it all to life in Manulife's ppt template and a future template for all account reviews. Thank you all. Teamwork is the engine for a high performance team and culture! YOU ROCK!!\n\n62#And, we're off!|This team had one heck of a year and they're already out of the starting gate to take on 2022! We're 14 days in and I am so inspired by the determination and planning that has lead to a LOT of strategic meetings already. We've already closed 2 more huge customers on the Inclusion Advisor, have Gratitude Summits underway---and a backlog of demand!, and have identified major opportunities with steps toward closing them. Congratulations on a great start to a fresh new year. Please hydrate!\n\n63#Bring on 2022!|What a group of inspirational and determined people all of you are!  In our time together this week at our QBRs, we focused on our vision and commitment to success in 2022.  I was blown away by the commitment and passion each of you demonstrated to continue to drive for the very best experience for our customers.  That in turn means, we will be driving for the very best for Workhuman.  2021 has been a challenging year in so many ways, both personally and professionally for each of you and the grit and fortitude you all demonstrate on a daily basis is unparalleled.  You all have blown your Moonshots out of the water and have continued to drive this business forward against many challenges.  The integrity and spirit of delivering the best experience for our customers, their culture and their employees is what continues to drive our success here as we continue to see more recognition happening at our largest customers.  You all are the lifeblood and I’m so proud to work alongside each of you.  Cheers!\n\n64#Abbott BELIEVES|Samar, Mark, and T Pesch= ROCKSTARS! Today's meeting with Michael Johnson and his entire DEI team plus his right hand HR visionary, Luz A, was the result of YEARS of showing up, doing the work, educating the people, and striking exactly the right match. This is a major combustion moment for launching us into the next atmosphere with Abbott. Both Luz and Michael have worked at Abbott for most of their careers, nearly all of those years together. They took a lot of creative license when working in the smaller divisions of the business and proved that doubling down on social recognition was proven to light up their culture and their performance. Flash forward to today, Luz is leading HR again at a small yet very critical division and once again counted on this team to come through with some inspiration and education. Big bang for Luz and for us. Luz reaches out to their newly minted CDO---Michael Johnson, who is now is an even bigger position to influence the broader organization. He's on their Executive Committee! He shared more today about Abbott than we've probably ever heard from his peers in Comp and was INSPIRED by the work we've shown on the DEI front. He took the time to call out what awesome work WH partners have done over the years and how proud he is to work with us and know us. Most importantly, he is pumped about getting started with our Inclusion Advisor and also our ability to create a new award reason that can amplify Inclusion as a value as well as amplify the work his ERG teams are doing. Incredible, powerful relationship building and trust. I'm SO DAMN PROUD OF YOU!!!!! Congratulations and let's DO THIS THANG!\n\n65#Big Moments at Abbott|Samar, Did you imagine when you were taking this picture that you would be crushing it and getting your first major renewal signed by Abbott?  You made getting this renewal signed look effortless and I know that was not the case.  Your dedication and professionalism is incredible.  Abbott is a long standing customer and under your leadership they have opened up and become a whole new partner.  I'm so very proud of the work you have been doing here, leading the way with Leadership Summits and up next, a meeting tomorrow with the CDO and his direct reports.  You have had a major impact on this customer and in a positively profound way.  Keep the inspiring work going!\n\n66#Delivering EXCELLENCE at AbbVie|A HUGE JOB WELL DONE to this mighty team supporting the Innovation and Ideation session with AbbVie last week.  We set out to help them pull together a leadership team across their Culture, Benefits, EEID and beyond to begin to craft the perfect energizing hub to support all recognition across all of AbbVie.  They requested a visionary session to help define and bring to life their aspirations for illuminating more recognition across the business with more rewards.  They shared that \"this is exactly what we wanted and it feels very AbbVie\".  Samar, you did a remarkable job setting up the vision for the session and outlining their needs.  You drove the team to align perfectly with what they were hoping to accomplish and will continue to partner with us on in future sessions and eventual rollout.  Traci, you jumped in to bring the very best expertise and customer experience to the session helping to define what the future could look like!  Your vision and passion always shines through and delivers beyond compare.  Melissa, you brought the vision to life perfectly from a visual perspective and delivered right on point.  Joyce, you set the stage perfectly for how the WH Cloud can support and illuminate all of the great work and aligning to AbbVie strategy.  Mark, you were the steady , calming force keeping us tied to the right metrics and essence of AbbVie.  Erica, your partnership and insights helped to build the momentum around the ROI and impact this is having at AbbVie and where it can build to in the future.  They were beyond engaged and so excited to continue the partnership while truly valuing this team's thought leadership.  Incredible work!\n\n67#I'm grateful for you!|Hi everyone, as we conclude the Gratitude Sessions for Manulife, I wanted to take a moment to express my own gratitude for this amazing team. You all really came together, used your imagination and determination to provide a solution in a tough situation. This huge effort was initiated from a very tough cookie and you all responded by providing $50,000 in fees-waived services (with no out of pocket expenses to WH) that will drive program adoption, growth, and sustainability especially in their Asian market. And some of you amazing people even popped in to help us test different functionalities (and signing in from every device known to man) to ensure each session would be delivered flawlessly. The stats are eye-popping  51% people leader attendance (in addition to a train the trainer model and future use on the LMS platform). 90% of those attending gave 5 stars--saying they would refer it to a friend. The PM said she is grateful for these valuable sessions. Thank you again!\n\n68#Bursting with Gratitude!|To this magnificent group of remarkable leaders, I wanted to share with you the gratitude I feel for all of you every single day.  Each of you brings a unique point of view and inspiring ways you’re leading our customers into the future.  I can’t imagine this journey without any of you.  My heart is overflowing with gratitude that I get the opportunity to work alongside you, learn from you, laugh with you, swear with you and be inspired by you.  Never have I ever worked with a more talented group of humans.  Thank you for being you!!!\n\n69#Gratitude for your FIRE!|To this incredible team of pros, I hope you are dancing alongside me (virtually) to our theme song! You are the Fire in the band! How lucky are we all to work together and make work for millions of people centered in gratitude?! I'm grateful for each of you every day and inspired by your passion, drive, and leadership. Dance a little, sing a little, and feel celebrated---Never was a cloudy day!\n\n70#Transforming the Future|This team is beyond INCREDIBLE and the TRUE DREAM TEAM!  As I think about the future of where Workhuman is going and the experiences we are working diligently to create in partnership with our customers, knowing all of you are leading the way makes me beyond proud.  We spent an incredible couple of days together leveraging our 'Empire State of Strategic Minds\" and worked with determination and passion to identify, align and set a path forward for what is next, how to get there, and take us well beyond a $1B company during our QBR session.  The level of strategic thinking, passion and determination you all demonstrated was truly inspiring.  The transformative strategy you all have outlined is what is going to move us forward in all the best ways with focus on our customers digital transformation, sustainability, agility, inclusion and equity efforts and beyond.  I can’t wait to see where the vision takes this team and the relationships you have built. Amazing work team!\n\n71#What slowdown?|Team fab. Every week I read your Strategic Insights and am blown away. It's actually a challenge to summarize the incredible work you are doing. Week after week, you are outdoing yourselves. The work that is happening today is work that we were only dreaming about a few years ago! You are truly setting a new bar weekly for us and forcing us to think bigger and bigger as an organization. Thank you for the work you are doing daily, conversation to conversation, meeting to meeting, internally and externally to make incredible things happen. And it's not just the work with customers, the collaboration and teamwork that you demonstrate every day makes me super proud. Thank you and Bravo!\n\n72#Creating a moment for Biogen|Team, great work celebrating the incredible 15 years Biogen has been a Workhuman customer.  The thoughtful video you created helped to share a moment that mattered with the broader Biogen team.  Having any customer for 15 years requires a number of folks rowing in the right direction, clearing obstacles, pushing new initiatives forward and delighting the customer consistently.  Amazing job formulating a plan and then executing with excellence for the customer.  Well done to all!\n\n73#Integrating me to the SCD Team!|One month in and I have had such productive one on one conversations with each of the broader SCD team including also Traci and Becky.  Thank you to everyone for being such a productive, positive and meaningful addition to my onboarding.  There is so much to learn from all of  you and I am so thrilled to be a part of this team.  Thanks for leaning in and helping me get up to speed!\n\n74#Customer Olympics Gold Medal Performers!|Go Team, Go!!! To this world class customer Olympic team and achieving the highest performance rating - GOLD! You are showing us all what great looks like and how to live our value of Imagination + Determination = Innovation. Let's start with the team captain, Eileen! Your strategic mindset and ability to see the big picture, constantly imagine future scenarios, pivot on a dime, and create world class strategies during a pandemic, and lead a team to your vision is unmatched. It was your voice saying \"let's move the full day in-person customer Gratitude sessions to the virtual world\" which lead to the birth of Gratitude Summits! Today, hosting this for Abbott marks the 19th session in a year! One customer was a repeat customer! Hope that brings a tremendous smile to your face. Customers like Abbott, J&J, ADP, Harman, GE and many more!   Samar, you have co-presented on J&J and now Abbott. You're a amazing partner, expert on gratitude and recognition, engaging presenter, storyteller and inspire audiences to take action. Plus, this is one of many strategies you have in place to expand Abbott's program activity and investment. Melissa, you have touched nearly every Gratitude Summit decks and made them all a work of art. Mark A, your such a supporter of trying new ways of working with Abbott to breakthrough, jump right in to support ongoing strategic efforts and last minute yesterday shared with Abbott how to complete a team award to send to all employees in Abbott HEMA on Monday, August 9th. Mark C, a huge thank you for your willingness to support Abbott HEMA Zoom Gratitude Summits from setting up the technology, to organizing the polls, to supporting on the day. Samar and I can't thank you enough! Luz and Erica sent a lovely email after today's session \"Thank you so much. I felt the session went really well.\" And the chat had numerous positive comments of Thank You. It takes a TEAM!! This team is GOLD!!! You Rock!!\n\n75#Influencing Elanco|Samar, truly incredible job influencing the Executive Director, Comp & Bens at Elanco, Toby Hahn to repeat your words back to the CHRO!  Toby shared with the CHRO that 28% of employees that left voluntarily this year received zero recognition.  The CHRO explained that he thought it was due to poor performance, but because of you, Toby say, \"Err No!  These people were high performers and they were the ones we didn't want to leave.\"  Talk about POWERFUL!  Then, he shared that he wants to do a Gratitude Summit in August and wants to add more budget to Inspire in 2022 due to all of the good things coming out of Inspire.  Truly incredible work Samar and I can't wait to see all of the goodness yet to come!  Way to influence the right people in all the right ways!\n\n76#One Tough Cookie|Samar - Wowza, you are one tough cookie (or in your terms, have the hide of a Rhino) given all that you have been handling over the past few weeks.  While you have many incredibly positive things you're spinning up, you also have a couple of customers that have been down right challenging to say the least.  You have been masterful in how you are handling these tough situations, staying calm, cool and collected.  You have worked incredibly hard to put together a very thoughtful, well researched approach in each situation and have just kept coming despite the many bullets heading in your direction due to no fault of your own.  I've been so impressed and in awe of your approach and positive focus.  Way to go!\n\n77#Global Account QBRs—Synergies!|Super excited after our two day meeting (i mean, with the time change, it was days right?)! You all brought your A game and applied the WH ‘MRI’ machine (T Pesch trademark) to our 6 biggest opportunites. We have so much great trouble to get into! Thank you for your energy, professionalism, creativity, ... but mostly for your teamwork and collaboration. I love this oportunity we have to focus and drive big growth.  The impact to the business is gonna be huuuuuge. Bravo!\n\n78#Progress with Manulife|Samar & Mike, great job working through all the many topics and conversations with the Manulife team.  You both have done just amazing work gaining partnership from this program team as we're closing in on their program's one year anniversary.  They can certainly be a challenging customer with many specific and unique asks, but you both show a focused attention on strengthening our relationship with their team while navigating a broad number of topics.  Having just been on a call with their program leaders they specifically called out your partnership and ways you've demonstrated incredible work to create the best recognition program for their employees.  I personally know how much you both have invested into this customer and want you to know that your efforts are paying off.  Thank you for all that you're doing with our Canadian friends, you are making an impact!\n\n79#Making Sparks Fly|Huge THANK YOU to all of you for an incredible Quarterly Business Meeting today!  We could have spent the entire 3 hours celebrating all of the amazing work you all are doing. You all are the visionaries leading our customers into the Future of Work and helping them to build cultures that celebrate their employees.  The work you’re doing is fundamentally inspiring employees to feel valued, included and recognized for their contributions and unique perspectives.  As we continue to drive towards our goals for the second half of the year, I am certain we will continue to make sparks fly in all the right ways.  Your dedication and passion for the work we do is unprecedented and so evident in all you deliver.  I continue to be blown away by the talent each of you bring and can’t thank you enough for everything you do to support our customers.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n80#Hooray for J&J!|Thank you all for preparing for and engaging with the Johnson and Johnson program team in this week's Strategic Account Review.  We received an immediate response from their Program Owner thanking us for the great conversation and insightful content.  Samar - thank you for your efforts in putting together the slide deck using our latest and greatest format.  You set the stage very well with an update on insights and learnings we have taken from 2020 and bringing focus to our word for 2021 - Connection!  Jay - thank you for walking the team through the key accomplishments and milestones of the Inspire Program over the past year and a half, including the fact that they have now surpassed half a million recognition moments!  Jim - thank you for covering the product roadmap and focusing attention on the key areas that are of importance to the J&J team.  It was clear from your update that we are listening to them and taking action.  Maggie - thank you for highlighting the key communications that we have partnered with the J&J team to complete along with the communication plan for 2021 including next month's rollout of Welcome Awards.  Our important partnership with their communication team shined through your update.  Erica - thank you for the deep data analytics dive showing J&J to impact that recognition is having on their organization.  They were clearly very engaged and intrigued by all of the information you provided to them, particularly the PM who wants to bring some of the data you covered into her quarterly report.  You love data and she does too so it will be a great pairing!  So Hooray for J&J and hooray for this team in collaborating to deliver such an impactful and engaging presentation.  Much appreciated team!!\n\n81#Always Ready!|Congrats and well done to this powerhouse team of Strategic Leaders on a blowout Q1! Your hard work and always ready mentality has proven to be our secret weapon. Every week I see you making major chess moves with our Strategic Accounts and teeing us up to win big. So many congratulations on the first of many successful quarters in 2021. Super proud of each of you and your new fabulous leader! Rock on!\n\n82#Challenges? What Challenges?|Samar, so many congrats on your most recent epic meetings with Bechtel, Hershey, and JNJ. I'm sure there are more that I'm missing but I happen to know that these 3 opportunities to STUN our customers have been led by you and your very creative and strategic mind. Taking on existing customers who have had a lot of turnover in leadership is a tough ask. You are managing to build the right relationships and give the right insights by partnering closely with our colleagues internally and positioning us for success. And, you are already stunning JNJ with Executive Summits. Wow! Way to go, short timer! You continue to rock!\n\n83#Showcasing recognition at J&J|Team, thank you all so much for all your tremendous work in delivering a top notch Gratitude Summit for the Johnson & Johnson Global Educators.  This was a great opportunity to motivate their team, work to instill a culture of recognition, showcase what the Workhuman is all about and highlight the many ways Inspire has become a focal point for a number of their people activities.  Chris and Samar, you were both amazing partners at this event and I'm thankful to have had the chance to work with both of you.  The content you delivered was so well received and it was done flawlessly.  Your deliveries were just natural and free flowing.  It felt like a true conversation with their team.  Traci, once again you showed why you are just a true professional and expert in creating memorable content.  You are a story teller who has a feel for the audience and how we want to get the points across that will resonate at an event.  Thank you for your support and guidance as we were preparing for this session.  Amy, thank you for jumping on this opportunity with lightning speed and helping to make this session a success.  You seized the chance to get in front of this global team and we now have potential events to expand our connections with the J&J teams.  I am thankful to work with such an incredible group of professionals who excel at what you all do.\n\n84#Together We Can for J&J|Together We Can!! Together We Can!!! Let's scream and shout for Chris, Samar, Jay, Amy and Sarah who inspired and delighted the Global Educators Group at J&J today! Amy, when Jennifer Parungao from J&J's Global Educators Group contacted you about participating in their Learning Series and bringing recognition expertise to this session, you jumped on it with a YES!! From there, this WH team collaborated to create an amazing Action Series - Celebrate, Reward, Recognize and Engage session!   What a ROCK STAR session this was with over 150+ participants who were hanging on your every words - Samar, Chris and Jay - participating in the polls and behind the scenes sending text messages to our contacts telling them how inspiring the content is and jotting down the learning moments. After the session, loads of glowing emails from Sara Derousse SVP, Jennifer, and Philip wrapped up the sentiment of the audience \"Thank you! This was a team effort and again a huge thank you to Samar, Jay, Chris, Traci & Amy!  The content in your engaging presentation was relevant and amazing!  I was getting communications near the end and after of how informative it was and how leadership wants to drive the empowerment of their employees.  Also the survey results are all 4.5 / 5 stars and above so far.\" HIGH Praise and ratings for this session. Plus, they're eager to have us participant in future sessions! Sarah, thank you for your creative skills with the Zoom background that tied into the look/feel of the presentation slides and putting our WH stamp on what an extraordinary, engaging learning session looks like! I'm INSPIRED by you all and can't wait to see where J&J's program will go in 2021! You are shining examples of how human-centered companies are changing the future of work and the world! YOU ROCK!!\n\n85#Inspire-d!|Samar and Jay, thank you for being such excellent collaborators and co-presenter‘s today to about 150 Johnson&Johnson ambassadors and leaders. Both of you were dynamic, polished presenters and you truly inspired participants to use their recognition culture to the max. And Traci, thank you as always for your guidance in putting all the pieces together, the content flow and ensuring that we were using quality communications. Well done all!\n\n86#Inspiring J&J!|All, amazing job today speaking to the employees at Johnson & Johnson about the value of recognition. We were tasked with explaining the strategic value of the Inspire program and the why behind gratitude - and you all hit it out of the park! From the prep work to the actual delivery of content to over 128 JnJ employees. Massive feat and huge congrats to you all. If I can quote one attendee: \"This is not a question but a comment. Thank you for this overview today. I am looking at my report and realize that much of my top talent has not been appropriately recognized formally by me and shows consistently low recognition. I do a lot of informal recognition daily, but I need to step up the formal recognition. Thank you!\"\n\n87#Telling your Story|Thank you for participating on our Life at Workhuman blog! As we look to grow our Strategy team, it's essential that we help prospective candidates understand more about the role and responsibilities, and the skills we look for so they can be successful. What better way to do that than by sharing stories about our own humans! I appreciate the time you took to share more about your professional background, and the work you put in to make this article a valuable resource for recruiting and employer brand. Thank you so much!\n\n88#A Team Appreciation Day!|Happiest Employee Appreciation Day to this team of badasses! I could not be prouder to work with such a team of professionals. You make work fun! You show up every day, leaning in, supporting each other, raising the bar, and celebrating every moment along the way. I hope you feel the love every day but especially today! Thank you for being such great caretakers of our mission and leaders for the organization. Strategic Client Directors lead the way!\n\n89#Elanco Leadership says Keep on Keepin' On!|Samar, Danielle, and Devon, I just heard the news about our friends at Elanco! A few months ago, you were surprised by Elanco's Toby with a message that their leaders felt that deep cost cutting was in order and on the docket was their multi million dollar Inspire program. He was given marching orders to cut their spend by 2/3rds. And the very second you heard that news, you all went into 'support the customer' mode. You methodically set out reconfiguring their program, giving great guidance on how to maintain impact without the bigger budget, but keeping them apprised of the value of the investment especially in tough times. Samar, you not only coached Toby through their value proposition and how he should be thinking and sharing that proposition with leadership, but you also recruited him to the bigger picture! You got him, the VP of Total Rewards, and their Global Head of Talent on with us to share the future of the platform and the impact the cloud could have on their engagement goals, specifically sharing our DEI strategy and our Moodtracker support, really opening their eyes to the power of the platform they have in their hands. A super strategic insightful move! I was SO delighted to hear this morning that Toby and his leadership team have concluded that while the last two years have been tough for employees and for their business, the next year will still be tough for employees and that \"the value of the Inspire program is far outweighs the cost...and is an important tool for the culture at Elanco...and that they would be holding steady and potentially be spending more this year\"...I mean.........YOWSA! I love that he was not only plainly saying \"yes\" but \"yes AND\" with an opening to do more communications to employees and managers about the power of recognition. YOU ALL ROCK! Congrats! Celebrate this win, because this could be a playbook in how to turn a 'no' into a 'HELLS YEAH!'! Bravo!!!!!\n\n90#Getting Hershey back on track|Samar - this is overdue, but I wanted to send a big thank you for all your partnership and help over the last couple months to get Hershey back on the right track. From the start you took the time to get to know the ins and outs of Hershey and came up with a strong plan of how we could work together to get some of the long standing strategic initiatives accomplished. After weeks of pushing and following up you finally got Melanie to get a date on the books for an account review. You have also been laying the foundation for expanding the Hershey program to include Life Events and Community Celebrations. You strive to give Hershey the best possible customer experience, which will go a long way with the upcoming renewal. I appreciate you joining our weekly calls and being a true partner on this account. I look forward to seeing all that you help Hershey accomplish in 2021!\n\n91#Visibility 2021|It's February 18! We're almost halfway through the quarter! What a whirlwind 2021 has been. Thanks to this team of inspired minds for coming together this week to review detailed individual action plans for our strategic accounts and also coming together to share our biggest opportunities with each other. We all learn and grow so much together and I LOVE IT! Special shout out to our new BFF, Yuri! Thanks so much for kicking us off, inspiring our thinking, introducing us to the best new yogi 2021, and giving us some insight and vision for the future of WHCE. We're so lucky to have you! Thanks to everyone on the team for contributing to our Periscope project and Data Insights project. We've made some real progress on ass kicking and it's 'only' February! I see you!\n\n92#Thank you for sharing your time!|Samar, thank you so much for taking some precious time out of your day to meet with me! First and foremost, it was just lovely to reconnect with you and catch up a bit. But second, I really appreciate the insights you gave me about what was appealing to you about the SCD opportunity at Workhuman, what makes it unique, and what core skills you think would allow someone to be successful in the role. As I dive into another search to expand the team, your insight will help me to evaluate talent in the market to find the best! Thank you again!\n\n93#Cha-Cha-Cha-Changes|We've all been riding a bit of a roller coaster with Elanco over the past few months.  We listened, we advised, we revised and ultimately we agreed to put a number of substantial changes in place for them in early February.  Samar - you were instrumental in helping set a strategy for this and keep a long term vision in place.  Danielle - you were amazing in building a rapport with Betsy and doing the heavy lifting to put together a communication plan. Noah - you were a great thought partner in helping determine how to restructure their program in Config and then made all of the required updates in Sandbox.  And then, well, Elanco Cha-Cha-Cha-Changed their mind and put all of this on hold indefinitely.  This is actually fantastic news as they will be keeping all of their current award level options in place and yet somewhat frustrating as we put so much time and effort into this.  But what you all have collectively done is demonstrated the power of our collaboration and partnership.  The program team at Elanco knows that we are there for them and knows that we have the best interest of their employee base in mind.  And for that, I thank you.\n\n94#Ready for a New Year!|Thanks to this very focused team of experts and leaders for creating something out of the tough 'hand' 2020 dealt us. Through all we've maneuvered through, I've consistently heard nothing but determination, strength, support for each other and for others, and a fierceness to overcome that is burned in my memory forever. As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking. Spending as much time as possible making things happen leaves little time for planning so all the more impressive how thoroughly you prepared to review action plans for each of your accounts. Thanks to our badass team of magicians, Traci and Rebecca for helping me pull off one of our greatest QBRs to date. Cheers to you all and to many more years of success together! You are all the magic of Christmas!\n\n95#Engaging Elanco!|Thank you for an incredible team effort on today's Account Review with Elanco.  You all came very well prepared not only with fantastic slides and well polished remarks but you also came with the willingness to listen, react and shift.  And despite some expected short-term headwinds as Elanco seeks to identify value capturing synergies in the next year connected to the recent acquisition of Bayer, it was so encouraging to receive immediate feedback from the Program Owner stating \"Thanks everyone.  Excited for what the future will bring for us.\"  We've got some work ahead of us to roll up our sleeves and help them re-envision what the 2021 version of Inspire looks like and we also have an incredible opportunity to seek to incorporate their Top Performer Awards into Inspire.  And it was so fantastic to hear their interest in Moodtracker, Life Events and Community Celebrations as well as interested in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.  So thank you again for your collective efforts in making this such a successful call and in so effectively Engaging Elanco!\n\n96#A Brilliant Refresh!|Thank you all for your collective efforts in refreshing the look and feel of HARMAN's Be Brilliant recognition site.  These changes have been pending since March and were finally revealed to employees on Monday as a kick off to their designated Month of Gratitude.  The hard work that goes on behind the scenes for something like this certainly does not go unnoticed and definitely deserves to be recognized.  And thank you especially for pivoting to accommodate the change to the image that came from me asking the question if what they were planning to use was the best representation of what they were trying to convey.  The site looks absolutely fantastic and will be a great backdrop for HARMAN as they get ready to turn monetary recognition back on in a few weeks.  So thank you all for an absolutely amazing and Brilliant Refresh!!!\n\n97#Grateful for the 'A' Team|Sending a heartfelt moment of thanks to this team of fierce friends. 2020 has been a test in many ways. The one thing that it has cemented for me is that the bonds that we make over time are clearly revealed in times of struggle. Thank you for your unwavering support of each other and the business through these many, many months of stress and hard work. Wishing each of you a day of rest and some time to reflect on your achievements thus far. I continue to be inspired by you and by the possibilities you see in yourselves and each other!\n\n98#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n99#Let's Do This, Partner!|Samar - your resilience and perseverance certainly paid off in landing a call with Elanco to help them set a renewed recognition strategy for their organization.  I appreciated how you dove right into the details to understand their current state and then painted a picture for a strengthened future state.  I look forward to our upcoming call with Elanco and the subsequent account review to help them continue to foster an exceptional culture of gratitude in order to fuel a company that has just recently doubled in size.  And for us, this is just the start of what I think is going to be a powerhouse partnership as we get ready to work together to enhance and expand two other programs as well.  I look forward to it.  Let's do this, partner!\n\n100#Gold Performance of Excellence @ Abbott|Samar!! Samar!! It's all in your name - Strategic, Action-oriented, Mastery, Ambition, Remarkable!!! That describes you to a T and your preparation and performance during your 1st Abbott Account Review. After taking over the reigns, you went right to work digging in to understand the world of Abbott. From gathering insights on key stakeholders, to mastering knowledge about their business goals, to imaging future scenarios and mapping out aggressive steps that will strengthen our partnership with leaders and bring about a new level of recognition excellence across the globe - it's clear you are a super ambitious human with a vision, strategy and plan!   Immediately, you built credibility and trust with the Abbott team from the moment you introduced yourself, shared your background and the value you bring to the partnership. Your human portrait in front of the Abbott sign brought smiles to their faces. Such a great \"moment that matters\" and memorable way to leave an impression on Mark, Mike and Jonelle. That was just the start. You then took the Abbott team though what's new at Workhuman with confidence, credibility, mastery of your words, in a captivating and engaging way! I immediately thought \"this is incredible\". This was the MOST ENGAGED the Abbott team has been in a decade. It was awesome to witness. Your prep and performance is something to be super proud of straight out the gate! You've set a new bar for future newbie SCDs. With your strategic guidance, can't wait to see where Abbott is a month from now, two months, three months. So much opportunity to expand and exponentially grow relationships, culture, recognition excellence and a whole lot more!! Watch out team, Samar is slaying!! You Rock!!\n\n101#Gold Star Impact at Abbott|The biggest of shout outs to this team of gold star talent! I'm so thrilled to hear about your resounding success at the Abbott partnership meeting yesterday! Not only did you get the attention of the Exec Sponsor but you had he and the HR Comms leader begging for more! Timing is everything but being prepared for that timing is REAL MAGIC. I'm super excited that you were READY and nailed it. So looking forward to your continued progress! Bravo!\n\n102#Headin' into Abbott Like|Samar, can I tell you how much I love this? You drove out to the Abbott headquarters building over the weekend to get a quick photo so that when you introduce yourself at Abbott, they get to really see how local you are! Well done---so smart! I just know you are going to rock it this week!\n\n103#Doing the dirty work|Let's face it, data clean up is no fun.  But, it's worth it!  Thank you for taking time out of your insane schedules to comb through data, find missing pieces and populate our tracker.  Becasue of your efforts we'll be able to get this into a centralized place - allowing us to work smarter and faster from here on out.  Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and getting it done!\n\n104#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n105#Another Strategic Client Director ready to ROCK|Samar, so many congratulations on 'completing' your SCD certification! I've been so impressed from the very beginning on your commitment to understanding the essence of our business and our fundamental truths and philosophy. You have been diligently researching, studying, and consuming content for weeks as well as meeting with all of the players on the WH team to really understand how we operate and lead. It's been such a joy to go through this 'final' phase and listen to you pitch the business to a 'new exec at a customer' and walk through the demo in a way that brings the WH Cloud to life. Thank you for making this process such a joy. I couldn't be more confident in your future and in the future success of your new customer list! Brava! Go get em!\n\n106#Training Toast|Samar, Eric, Isha, Jason, Rachael, Devon, Kelsey, Michael,   What a WEEK! Thank you to my fellow trainees and colleagues for a successful HR onboarding week! You all brought incredible energy and insightful questions to each call and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each of you. Our virtual coffee chats were nice this week but I have no doubt we continue this comradery in person at Ignite or Workhuman Live in the near future.    I look forward to continuing to learn from you, lean on you and grow with you here at Workhuman!   Cheers!\n\n107#The Two Day ZoomBR Bonfire!|Thanks to this amazing team for two days (well, half days) of inspired thinking and planning in preparation for an amazing 2nd Half! As much as we missed the personal interaction and late nights, we managed to reconnect in a way that we really haven't been able to pull off in a few months! Special shout out to our Queen, Traci Pesch! She really knows how to inspire, engage, and fan the flames of success! Between Traci and Rebecca's creative minds we've got a great plan to find s'more ways to connect and create incredible experiences for our customers! And, looky here, we've got ourselves a marketing team! Thanks ever so much to the gods who sent us our fierce team in customer marketing, represented with the incredible Kristen G! A thoughtful, workable plan to bring our friends into the many cool streams happening in marketing. And lastly, thanks to all of you badass SCDs, always bringing the big ideas, shaking things up, pushing beyond your comfort zones and helping our customers do the same! I'm humbled and impressed every day to get to work with such a powerful group of people who do nothing but cheer each other on! Let's go light this thing up!\n\n"
