"0#We made work super human this week!|Cheers to this awesome crew for all digging in this week to help find, package, label and ship 107 Making Work Human books out to prospects to keep the \"dial moving\" on maximizing our meeting potential in September while we transition vendors.  We are lucky to have such a dedicated Marketing Leader in you, Alessandra. You dug deep to get these books to us and then came to lend a hand with fulfillment which is greatly appreciated!  Ultimate teamwork.  Thank you, all!\n\n1#DEMOnstrating greatness for Gallup!|John and Jesse - I just wanted to take a moment to call out your contributions to the recent Gallup demo. John, you rolled up your project management sleeves and took the reins to get the project rolling and on schedule while I was on vacation like the maestro you are. Jesse, it comes as no surprise that you hit yet another home run on the branding side (its amazing just how consistently unique and high quality your work is on the sales side!). Thank you both for the fantastic work!\n\n2#We are off and running!|Z, Moe, Celia, Simran, Stacy, and Wamby, Thank you for the planning and collaboration last week during our process meeting.  We have a big fat hill to climb, and this work is a top priority for Marketing for us to grow and scale.  I have a feeling we will really get to know each other over the next six months, improving how we work, and having some fun along the way.  Thank you!  John\n\n3#Pfizer Customer Story!|30 days ago we made a decision to capitalize on an incredible customer story opportunity with Pfizer. We’ve gone from brief, securing a senior Pfizer executive, main story production, capturing user testimonials from a myriad of people across their org to building relationships over dinner in NYC and final asset editing ..... all in under 30 days. Thank you for your commitment to our customers, for making decisions promptly, and for collaborating cross-functionally. This is all in service of ensuring that we maximize the business impact of the relationship and the created asset. We’re going to have such a great asset for marketing, customers, and sales in the future and your collective leadership made this all possible. Thank you!\n\n4#Holding down the demo fort!|I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for covering for me in demo land while I was on vacation last week. The sales team was in fantastic hands with this incredible group of humans. Two demos delivered, and a new one kicked off that we wrapped up this week! On top of that, with everything in great shape it made my Monday re-entry easier than ever. So lucky to have teammates like you!\n\n5#Thank You|Wamby, thank you so much for your support navigating agency relationships these past few weeks.  It's a delicate dance and your steady hand has made everything much easier.  I so appreciate the collaboration, teamwork, and unwavering support!\n\n6#WH Certified gaining human (freelancer) support!|John - HUGE thank you for prioritizing and accelerating the hiring process to find, interview, and secure a new freelancer who will be 100% dedicated to supporting me and WH Certified!  Brian - While it will be tough for anyone to fill your shoes, after 3 years project managing WH Certified, your stamp of approval for Rodney goes a long way.  Both - Like you, I was energized by my conversations with Rodney and am thrilled he'll be joining us on Aug 1. Knowing a dedicated human is on the way to support WH Certified is a big boost and I can't wait to see what can be accomplished with a new strategic partner in crime. :)\n\n7#10-4 driver - the drive is on video island… over!|John, thank you for taking the time to quickly meet with our photographer from Spark Summer to grab the hard drive and drive it all the way into the office for the video team. By doing that you saved money for shipping and time to receive files while additionally creating an easier experience for our vendor. I hope you didn’t bribe him to remove the footage of you dancing with DJ Bengey! Classic Wamby moves! Thanks again for always being so willing to jump in and help!\n\n8#CMS team for the win!|The hardest part about writing this award was deciding which spark to choose. Determination? Yes. Teamwork? Yes. Quality? Yes. Urgency? Yes. When this group collaborates amazing things happen. We have the Contentful agreement in place & now the real work begins 💪🏻 Excited to continue working with this team! Next project – getting Thomasina to negotiate a free honeymoon 😉\n\n9#Marketing Partners|John and John :) It was a pleasure meeting with you both recently and I really appreciate the time you both took to tell me more about your team, how we can work together going forward and for bringing me through the Marketing deck which is really helpful for me to understand your teams goals and plans for the remainder of the year. Thanks for sharing!\n\n10#Momentum is a good thing!|On behalf of the NA ABM team, thank you for your time and participation in our planning and strategy sessions this week. To see the enthusiasm, respect for quality, and vision coalesce is motivating. I'm very excited to execute what I know will be meaningful work for the business with our incredible teams.\n\n11#Problem solving|For months, we have been red flagging the need for more copywriting supprt and more recently additional design support. While we’re being asked to prove the need, it’s obvious to us based on the larger amounts of work coming in and the ask to reduce the availability of each creative to allow more time for meetings, conversations, wellness, etc. Thank you for jumping in once again to push this forward to give it the attention it needs! I’d hate to lose any of these amazing creatives due to burnout. This will also allow the PM team to more easily start taking on new requests once they’re in place and onboarded. Thank you again for listening and doing something about it!\n\n12#Support on the daily|John, For all of the listening and great advice you give on the daily, all of the help in Workfront and reporting, support you provide with Cella and resourcing, PM process, agency management, 2023 marketing planning, and the 32,943 other things you do because you’re a good human and are there for everyone, not just me. Thank you.\n\n13#Zoom on Zoom|Team, Extra special thanks for all the supporting work that went into our presentation to Zoom today. Everything we put in front of them was personalized and first class. From the custom backgrounds to the custom video to the custom demo site, each of you contributed to one or more of these aspects that led to great feedback from a prospective client.  Very well done team and Team West appreciates your support. Its an honor to be on your team.\n\n14#Driving us forward|Thank you to this team for participating, researching, preparing questions, and providing feedback for the recent CMS vendor demonstrations. Our ability to deliver effectiveness and consistency is driven by the technology and platform that underpins the work. At this phase, it was crucial that we ask the right questions to ensure we made the best and most educated decisions possible. I'm excited about where we have landed, reflecting this team's fantastic work! Thank you again for your professionalism and expertise with this leg of the journey. The future is looking bright!\n\n15#Asana - Project Management RFP|Thank you all for your help with identifying a Project Management tool for Workhuman, which will help teams better manage and improve transparency for both internal and external projects, integrating with the tools we know and love.   This was a long process with multiple demos and loads of documentation to wade through so thank you all for your guidance, patience, and support throughout.\n\n16#One Team One Plan...and One More Great Call|Sam, Amanda, Brian, and John, Thank you for highlighting the great work you are leading and sharing with the team.  You are making great progress on testing, QA, working with Sales, and process work, and it was helpful for the team to hear your progress and see your vision!\n\n17#Thank You So Very Much!|I can't thank you enough for helping me create a special moment, especially one that had some time sensitivity attached to it.  Recently during a couple meetings with TTEC, our 'Human Portraits' went over incredibly well, both with the Chief People Officer and Global Employee Engagement Manager.  They mentioned how great it would be if they had something like that, and with a quick email and phone call to the both of you...voila.  You helped me pull together a custom 'Human Portrait' for them, using their colors and logo.  The initial reaction was pure excitement.  Maybe it will be something that they adopt, and will forever make them think of their future partner in Workhuman.  Thank you so very much!\n\n18#Up and to the right!|Team - I wanted to recognize an outstanding effort over the last two weeks to rally around a plan that will dramatically scale our 1:1 ABM marketing plans and deliver increased coverage. You've generated great excitement for the demonstrated progress ABM programs have contributed in recent wins like Seagate and Prudential, and revealed an opportunity to accelerate pipeline by doing more! Across demand generation, marketing ops, HX, and creative you build a solid plan and started phase one of its execution! Thank you for your teamwork and proactivity together to look at how work gets done in a different way. With gratitude, -C\n\n19#Thanks for your time!|John thank you for your time last week.  It was early for you and even whilst walking your dog you made time to connect!  Appreciate the time and look forward to connecting with you again to learn more about Workfront!\n\n20#Transmission SOW Renewal Sprint|Hi Wamby & Thomasina - Thank you so much for what was effectively a full-quarter worth of negotiations and revisions with the Transmission agency team on our US SOW. It extended our SOW detail from about 1-2 pages last year to 10 pages this year. It is by far the most detailed SOW I have seen, and I could not have done it without your consultation and input. With this strong foundation in place we are on track to have a robust 2022!\n\n21#Need help with an agency? Call Wamback!|John, thank you for all your help with agency management for the next round of commercial ads with Element thus far. It's so refreshing to have such a great relationship with Element and a huge testiment of that is because of YOU - your negotiation skills, understanding the scope and requirements have guided us to finalize our Creative Development contract and get the ball rolling. Great working relationships lead to making amazing work - thank you for all your teamwork in this process.\n\n22#Providing direction!|Angela, Rachel, and John, Thanks for being an important part of our Monthly Team Call yesterday.  The team identified areas of improvement, and you shared how to get here.  Thank you!\n\n23#Invaluable collaboration and support|It was a Friday before a long weekend but that didn’t stop anyone from rallying to help keep the vertical program launch moving forward. Danielle and Ana, thank you so much for taking the time to review and walk us through the 6sense segmentation and for all your effort in driving proper campaign taxonomy and mapping. Anthony, thank you for all the backend work in Marketo and Salesforce to ensure the leads and tracking flow properly, for working through the uberflip streams and for providing the account lists we needed for Sales. Rachael, thank you for collaborating with all the team members from Ops, Creative, Paid Media and Project Management to ensure all parts were working together and pushing forward, for keeping all stakeholders updated, and for getting all support materials ready for Sales so they can hit the ground running when leads start coming in. John, thank you for taking my late Friday afternoon call to discuss how we can keep the project running smoothly and launch on time. The collaboration and support you have all provided is invaluable and  extremely appreciated. Together we’ll keep the boat moving forward! Thank you.\n\n24#Open discussions lead us to success|John, Maureen, and Chris- thank you for having an open and honest discussion last week about our weekly creative reviews to each walk away with ways to make this workflow smoother for ourselves and our teams. We each have an important part to play in keeping our brand top of mind. We found some immediate efficiencies, after just 2 weeks in. We will continue to improve and do it together. Chris- I especially appreciate your willingness and utter excitement about utilizing the new proof dashboard in Workfront outside of these meetings! (Haha) It may not be as glamorous as we’d like it to be, but it’ll help your entire team get the answers they need in a crystal clear, consistent way. Thanks for getting on board!\n\n25#This is the way|John - I just wanted to take a moment for a long overdue thank you for your support, guidance and friendship over the past few months. Our team has changed quite a bit recently, with some moving to other teams while many, many more PMs have joined our ranks. Through it all you've been a steady guide and champion of process for the team, while at the same time ready and willing to jump into support each of us as individuals when needed. Looking forward to everything 2022 has in store for our team...as well as your review of the long awaited season finale of The Book of Boba Fett! Thank you!\n\n26#Rescuing the rescuer|Thank you for helping me help Wendy find a Product sell sheet file today and get it to print. I appreciate you.\n\n27#Building an agency plan|John, Your work to build a cohesive long-term plan is exactly what is needed.  Richard and I appreciated your efforts and the next steps you outlined. More to come with many colleagues over the next few months.  And you are off to a great start!\n\n28#Another big step in 2022 Planning!|Team, I feel like I work with a team from TV!  Great work over the past week making more progress on our 2022 plan so we have another outstanding year.  Thank you for your individual work, the team work, and the many chuckles over the past two days.    To the Real A Team! John\n\n29#To greatness!|I wanted to take a moment to set the right tone for 2022 by saying thank you and acknowledging all the great we were able to produce as a team. All the collaboration and effort we put in helped to make my part more effective. I hope I was able to do the same. Thank you for helping me track down files, providing constructive feedback, addressing copy edits, and for your collaboration on all the web, demo/abm projects...  as Owen would say, #blessed :)  Happy new year and wishing you all the best\n\n30#The all powerful ABM acceleration Plan!|Hi all, I wanted to thank you for your recent work on the ABM acceleration plan. Without doubt, this was a tall order given the time-frame. I was struggling to decide whether I should base this reward on Respect for Urgency or for Teamwork because it was inclusive of both. All of you really pulled together from initial strategy to briefing to implementation & execution. All assets have been delivered to Transmission and are now live which was our ultimate goal along with marketing automation and asset creation. We have learned so much from the acceleration plan, both from a strategic pov and from a process pov. I am looking forward to tracking the performance to see which accounts are primed for 1:1 and ultimately feeding pipeline. A very well done to you all.\n\n31#The Workhuman Wizards|In our world of sales, we do everything we can to drive deals forward.  However, there's no way possible we could deliver the kind of impact to our future customers without the support of our team.  There has been an immense amount of work that has been put in behind the curtain, as we recently have been working on the Seagate account.  Anna and Michael have done a brilliant job with the very detailed RFP, and the questions continue to keep trickling in.  The support from Dan, Geoff, Jesse, Christine and John with all the assistance on the custom demo was so helpful...as it really helped show how much we pay attention to the little things that mean so much to them.  Last and definitely not least...Lucy, Olivia, and Sean were instrumental in helping with our ABM efforts.  Thank you all for the quality of work you have all put in to support our efforts, and I hope to be able to share some great news soon and add Seagate to the Workhuman Family!!!\n\n32#There is a Superhero in all of us|Blown away again by his team's commitment to dropping everything to come together and use their collective talents to drive the business. Here's to all of you in celebration of teamwork!  When it matters most, we step up, rally the troops, and march right into the battle headfirst. Yesterday was another great example of what happens when you bring great minds together, the sparks fly, the ideas flow and suddenly we have a solution. There is a Superhero in all of us, we just have to put on the cape. Cheers to the team!\n\n33#Miro Miro on the wall...|Thanks a million for hunting down the solution to my Miro issue!! I had no idea I was signed into two accounts 🙄I'm not the most tech savvy all the time and it was urgent–thank you for being my speedy savior!!!!\n\n34#P is for Partner, and Pivot,|And of course... Process. I am thankful for your time and partnership in continuing to manage process improvements, always ready to discuss and adjust to support the marketing team. While it may feel like Lucy is pulling the football at the last second over and over, we do make Progress! Cheers to this group of dedicated humans.\n\n35#Scenario Planning Sesh #1 was what I'd call a Win|My head is spinning from all the inspired thinking in today's planning meeting. Thank you for sharing your Plans on a Page <or is it 'Plan on a Pages?!'> with the broader team. Thank you for deep diving into some of our Marketing priorities to identify integration points, gaps, opportunities for testing, and more. It was awesome to see different people gather to collaborate cross-functionally and spend time thinking about the \"what if sh....scenarios.\" And lastly, thank you for being good sports about the ice breakers questions. From Buzz Lightyear to time machine travel, childhood crushes  and early retirement dreams, I learned a lot of new things about each of you today!  And yet, I am sure you all agree that it felt like we barely scratched the surface in our three hours today. Not to worry! This is the starting point and I have a good feeling that this was just the first of many Scenario Planning sessions to come. So strap in and look forward to next steps AND the next invite. I am excited to work together to ensure we are set up to deliver business results, feel proud of our work, and have some fun along the way.\n\n36#Brand Experience, meet Sales Experience.|Wams, thank you for your leadership in assembling such a strong cross-functional team to take on the task of creating better, more consistent and more targeted Brand touch points earlier in (and throughout) the sales cycle. Once locked, loaded and onboarded, I have no doubt that this fun, fast and equally creative- and metrics-driven group of humans will make a huge impact on how we systematize and continually optimize the process for surrounding targets, nurturing leads and closing deals. Great job. Nice haircut!\n\n37#Team work + Good work!|Hi John,   I wanted to give you a \"Shout Out\" Award to say thank you for all recent efforts, and pulling together everything staff and team related on the current acceleration plan. It will take nothing less than absolute team work to get this series of programs off the ground, and you have been instrumental in this endeavor. Cheers!\n\n38#Get the best at the best price!|Team, I am thrilled to see the work in securing the agency to help lead us to the next level of the website.  Your planning was meticulous, we picked the right vendors, asked the right questions, selected the right vendor, and now have an agreement that is best for what we are looking to accomplish.  Now the real work begins!  And this team will get it done!  Well done so far!\n\n39#Taking the PM team to new heights|John, You joined the team back when it was just a team of two and look at us now. You had a vision and we quickly went from 5 to now 8. Thinking back to the days I managed 100 projects, we never had the focus on any one thing or the chance to be more strategic in our roles. We never had a true PM as a manager here. Then you came into our lives and gave us new hope with your chill, funny, positive, open personality. There was finally relief in site! You’ve shifted the work around and let us choose our teams while hiring great contractors to take over all the other work. Today, as the teams around us continue to grow, your ability to implement the right data and reporting from Workfront has proven the need for additional support. I’m not sure how seriously our team has been taken in the past, but I believe nay sayers finally see our true worth and what we’re capable of. You always put so much trust and belief in my teammates and I, offer great advice, are willing to lend a hand when needed, not to mention always have something funny to say to keep us laughing. Thanks for taking our team to new heights and remaining selfless along the way! Also, I was planning to write this anyway before I happen to realize …it’s almost National Boss’ Day! Perfect alignment!\n\n40#A look into Project Management minds|Angela & John, thank you both so much for your time in discussing Workfront and project management at large with me. This recognition is about a month+ overdue, but better late than never! While I am currently exploring and testing tools and software for my pod, I think of the meetings I had with each of you often as they were so helpful in setting the tone for my journey with this project. Angela, we spent much longer than the half hour I originally scheduled with you (thank you!) and your quick demo and insight of the Workfront tool helped cut through some of the clutter of such a complex software and distill down what could be useful for our usecase. Without that, I would be wandering around the software for what seems like an eternity! John, you were so open to meeting with me and were curious about our situation and suggesting some viable solutions for my pod. You really bridged the gap for me in terms of giving me an opportunity to learn the software by letting me take a look around myself, which is a show of trust and is invaluable as I explore options. I came to both of you out of the blue, from a different part of the organization, throwing out a cold call for some advice and you both welcomed me to pick your brains and ask questions! Amazing support. Thank you so much for your respect for teamwork.\n\n41#Because without the human, it's just work!|Team, we did it! Three net new commercials approved.   From bringing innovative concepts to the table, diligently managing internal/external processes and people, selecting cast members and custom audio, to evolving our product look & feel, addressing key stakeholder feedback, and more - we did it with respect for urgency, respect of customers, respect for innovation, respect for quality, and respect for all!    Thank you all for your selfless sharing of your expertise and active involvement in every phase of the commercial project. Your contributions have helped us achieve a high-quality project that addresses the zeitgeist and demonstrates the ROI of our products, and how we solve the most pressing issues facing the CHRO.  I’m so proud of this team and what we’ve achieved.     Let’s get them into the market!\n\n42#ABM growth plan|Team - I wanted to recognize the large amount of progress you've made in the last two weeks on building out this plan to drive accelerated pipeline growth in partnership with our Sales team. This is an exciting initiative and requires new thinking on approach to the work, which you've all done brilliantly. Look forward to continued progress together and seeing this show up as positive impact to the business in Q4 and beyond. With gratitude, -C\n\n43#Leading, and leading some more|Team, While I was out rrrrrriding, you were here working, and leading.  While I offered to support if my help or opinion was needed, you lee me do my thing and you did great work, as usual.  I feel so fortunate to work with such a dedicated, smart, and kind group of people.\n\n44#One to One takes Many!|Team - I want to acknowledge the degree to which you all have jumped head long into building our plans and capabilities for Q4 growth that continues into FY22. Through a quick turn set of meetings we've made strides of progress. And we know there is more planning and organizing we'll work through together to finalize a sustainable plan. I look forward to doing that work together with this team. Thank you for your willingness to lean in and do new things. With gratitude, -C\n\n45#H2 Ads... you aint' seen nothing yet!|Team,  With incredible resilience, agility, compassion, and humility, you have taken in learnings from H1, sought out and acted upon critical feedback, and have masterfully managed the relationship with our new agency to create an end product that demonstrates what high quality commercial ads should look like. I am so proud of the work you are doing and am super excited to see what's next.  Well done!  Let's go go go.\n\n46#UHS Video!|Team - I have to applaud you all for putting together an amazing video for our upcoming finalist meeting with UHS. I know you all had other pending deadlines, but you still delivered an exceptional video that truly resonates with the prospect. Having already received some amazing feedback from my executive sponsor at UHS that \"this is awesome and spot-on\", I'm even more confident this will resonate with their executive leadership group next week. I appreciate each and every one of you! Mark\n\n47#Trust the Wamback|John, huge thank you for making it happen with the design resource we need for the SMB work. Not just that you found us some solid options quickly, but you heard what was needed and found just the skillset I had in mind. Thanks for sweating the details!\n\n48#When you look up true friend in the dictionary|John, in my 16 months at Workhuman, there has never been a week where I have not heard a story about your kindness or witnessed firsthand how you step in and step up to help a colleague in need. From sharing a kind word to telling a well-timed funny story to taking on a long sheet of to-dos to help the team out, you always take the time to ensure that every one of us has what we need to do our best work and to be the best versions of ourselves.  You are the definition of a true friend.  Here's to humanity in the workplace.\n\n49#The secret magic sauce behind the scenes|Jen, John, Christina, Cullen, and Thomasina,  Thank you for creating the foundation for the magic to happen!  Our next series of rich stories and high value production commercial videos are going to be instrumental in our continued path of breaking through the noise - and letting the world know that it is time to work human.  From optimizing new and existing agency relationships to creative genius, you have kept this engine going at full capacity without missing a beat and with such grace and commitment to excellence.  THANK YOU for all you do!\n\n50#It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.|Thomasina and Wamby, Your plan for working with agencies continues to deliver.  Thank you for turning the plan into action, and getting better terms, a professional approach, and saving us money.   Simply put put, your work here has had the highest quality and amazing results!  John\n\n51#Vacation Coverage|Thank you for covering my responsibilities while I was on vacation recently. I appreciate the extra effort and am grateful for teammates that can keep the work moving, including on my first day back while I was catching up. Cheers!\n\n52#The Final Countdown|The Band was Europe and the song was “It’s the Final Countdown.”  Here’s to the Band that pulled the Spotlight broadcast launch together. Following months of preparations, the official launch hit the streets on Wednesday and the registrations are rolling in. Congratulations to all of you for the effort, creativity, and teamwork.  T-48 and counting!\n\n53#Tireless Dedication to Team Success|John, this shout out goes to all things you do, large and small, that contribute to team success. Specifically, through your freelance staffing partner, we have streamlined the vetting of top candidates who often become full-time, amazing Workhumans. Add that to your self-less contributions to operational process, strategic initiatives and creative resource management, and I couldn't ask for a better Creative-PM partner. But don't worry, all the time and effort you've put in across the board hasn't aged you at all. Cheers, pal. Hat tip, you!\n\n54#The Answer to the Pythagorean Theorem|The great Shaquille O'neal once eloquently compared his offense to the pythagorean theorem: There is no answer. This is how it seemed as I looked at my summer workload as August PTO approached, and had no answer as to how I would take time off during such a busy period of time. Thankfully you jumped in and went above in beyond, driving meetings, keeping projects moving and contributing great ideas and even some Powerpoint slides for Workhuman Certified. Thank you for being a great leader and teammate, and allowing me to have a well needed break to visit with friends and family in Maine.\n\n55#Alllll On Board!|John, Thank you for all of your work to bring on some new people from Cella.  And doing so with humanity.  Each time I meet them, they talk about how kind and helpful you have been and how they enjoy working with you.  Great job building out this team!  John\n\n56#Need for Speed|John, i wanted to recognize you for the speed in which you escalated two issues that needed to be addressed urgently. One of them involving a vendor and another one involving a last minute project for the video team. Thank you for getting visibilty on these and quick progress!\n\n57#Rising Up.. Did our Time…Took Our Chances|Tiger Team, I’m continuously amazed by your performance week in and week out. The last 3 weeks working on up-leveling the H2 commercial strategy, storyboards, and scripts while onboarding a production house has been a doozy. Thank you all for your commitment to excellence and quality, your focus on driving our brand story to the next level, and for always placing our customer at the core of the experience. As a team, you’ve innovated, inspired, worked weird long hours, accepted different perspectives, fielded and actioned feedback, and managed communications to keep everything on track for phase 1 approval. Keeping this shared team mindset, the drive for only great advertising, and the ability to critically grade our own homework will make the transition from storyboards to production a beautiful thing to be part of. I'm ready for pre-production challenges, are you?\n\n58#For your awesome team spirit|I wanted to show my appreciation for all your help, for the countless times you were there to answer all my questions. It's pleasure to work with you!\n\n59#Working Human Champions Unite!|I wanted to express my gratitude to this fine team of colleagues who have come together to share ideas, express concerns and TAKE ACTION to help shape the human experience and culture for our Marketing team. Your commitment goes way back to last fall when we formed the original Pulse Survey Groups but we reinvented ourselves about a month ago and decided there is strength in numbers. When you share a common goal and vision, it might make sense to join forces. And, wow...were we spot on. I love the collaboration and get giddy when hearing and seeing the larger group feed off each other's ideas. This group championed the DiSC workshop as our first official all hands L&D opportunity. This group helped reimagine the town hall as a platform to showcase the strong work and diverse voices across all of Marketing. This group is thinking ahead to what the next phase of work, when we step away from our Zoom calls and return to the office in some form or fashion, means for our newest marketers and everyone else that survived the last year+! This group is thoughtfully pulling together strategies to help foster the human connections that will inevitably make our team stronger and our work even better. It's a side hustle when we are all hustled out most days, but it matters and I genuinely appreciate your investment. We've only scratched the surface, but after receiving positive feedback on yesterday's town hall and coming off of a lively planning call with many of you earlier today regarding our next couple of initiatives, I am feeling optimistic about the journey we've chosen to take together. #btpftp THANK YOU for your commitment to me, to each other, to all of Marketing, and to working human!\n\n60#Who you calling a kitty cat?|Video Ad Tiger Team - thank you for all of your preparation, ideation, and a whole lot of laughs as we prepped for the next phase of ads for our amazing, beloved brand.  Because of your tiger team mindset, you took every barrier and turned it into a strategy to something great. You treated every smoother path as an opportunity to accelerate toward outcomes.  The end result of your collective roar:   Amazing purr-worthy options to share our story, our brand, and our solutions and lots of collaboration.  Onward!\n\n61#Grateful for each of you!|Early planning for World Gratitude Day has me feeling pretty grateful. Kevin, you have been such a great partner on WGD, working hard to lift your strategy off the ground. Thank you for working on multiple briefs, strategy decks and presenting your big picture goals to multiple teams. Chris and John, thank you both for dedicating time to WGD by fitting all of the strategic information and deliverables we’ve collected over the past few months into the new brief and working collaboratively to formalize the new process you’ve been working on to create a better structure for Tier 1 work. To each of you (James, Jon, Melissa, Allison, Jason, Lisa, Colleen, Christina, Katie, and Laura) who put in the effort to propose deliverable ideas and present them for input in our intake meeting, thank you for strategizing on all the different levels of brand awareness! Liu, thank you for all your creative thinking and concepting as we gear up to start kicking off projects so we can fit and align everything together as a story. Ana thank you for stepping in to listen during our big intake meeting on several department’s proposed deliverables and then sharing back a fully drawn out Lucid Chart to map out the user journey, flag concerns, and point out gaps. There’s a lot of work happening right now to bring this all together in a cohesive manner. I’m so happy we’re months ahead planning for a day that makes total sense for Workhuman to own!\n\n62#Super Reporting|Thank you for making a super cool report that shows resource capacity. Easy to use and illustrate how and where we spend our time. Your Workfront skills are a big asset to the department. Cheers!\n\n63#Keep it rrrrrrrrolling!|Thomasina and John, The agency plan is superb, and thanks for sharing the latest with Patti.  She appreciated the work done to date and the vision.    Keep it rolling!!!\n\n64#Lending a helping hand|John, thank you so much for stepping in to help with our recent webinars while Mark was on vacation. We were still learning the ropes on how to setup and execute the webinars via zoom, and really appreciate your support! You reviewed the setup with us, you helped Q&A the video recordings, and you were on-hand the day-of in case we needed technical (or moral) support. We really appreciate your time, support, humor and partnership!\n\n65#Consistent Dedication To Teamwork|John! Your dedication to collaborative teamwork while leading various key project deliverables has provided a strong sense of trust, confidence, and peace of mind. Thank you for driving the integration of team members, holding people accountable, and operationalizing the needed processes to get our marketing programs into the market.

Your willingness work quickly through teamwork and a total dedication to quality has left me in awe!\n\n67#Building a great plan with agencies!|Thomasina and John, Great work on \"the why\" for an agency plan with a ton of depth and structure.  This work is sorely needed, and your leadership is deeply appreciated!\n\n68#Structural Support|Thank you for your valuable partnership in preparing for and delivering today's post-WHLO webinar. As I said in our quick debrief, it feels so good to have such a qualified and attentive group of experts propping things up, making content shine, handling logistical details, maneuvering messy technology, and providing smart, just-in-time feedback. It's a pleasure working with each one of you! Let's do it again tomorrow!\n\n69#Friday Night (Green) Lights|We were past the extended deadline and needed one last review of the commercial to make it into the Workhuman Live Online event. Thank you for making time to review and respond quickly. Cheers!\n\n70#Badge of Honor|Team, this month marks a time in our company's history: a linear TV/CTV and omni-channel brand campaign.  Bringing our company's first commercial to market has been quite the adventure.  Despite years of experience between us, none of us had ever brought an ad to market during a pandemic. We learned so much together. It has been joyful, difficult, fun, frustrating, and one of the best examples of resilience, trust, compassion, and teamwork I have seen,  At each and every step, you remained positive, committed, and determined to create something beautiful.  Thank you for all of your hard work.  Excited to see what comes next. I am so proud of you!\n\n71#Diving into the deep end...what, there's no water?|Water or no water, you dove in immediately, helped out big time with Havas and the commercial, and made a Huuuuuuuuge difference this week.  Your hard work, done quickly, across multiple teams was done with the highest quality.    Have a great weekend!\n\n72#Paving the way|Team, what a crazy whirlwind these past few weeks have been.  We are creating a foundation from which our brand push and investment in the funnel can realize gains in our brand health and valuation and our business outcomes unlike any we have seen before. It is such an honor to work alongside each of you as we work through our combined objectives, different investment mix models, and performance indicators that help us understand the impact of each and every dollar. Thank you for bringing your all to the table, for creating incredible relationships with our agencies, and by holding up a level of accountability that both inspires and ignites excitement for what is to come.\n\n73#Swoops in and saves the day|Carrie and John, in just a matter of minutes, you two assembled and created a dream team to get critical slides across the finish line in a matter of hours for Eric. Thank you so much for your attention to detail, to quality, to urgency, and to teamwork. Loved collaborating on this project with you both.\n\n74#Launch of Hootsuite Amplify!|Today we launched our new employee advocacy program, Hootsuite Amplify! This 8 month long project touched a lot of teams and required tons of communication, collaboration, and attention. I want to recognize all of you for your support along the way that helped today's launch go as smoothly as it did. This is the first and an incredibly important step to becoming a social first organization. Thank you all for your contribution, patience, input, and dedication to the program's success.\n\n75#Thank you!|Thank you for all your help with the rush project. Your calm demeanor, the meeting scheduling and ensuring all the right players were involved at the right time made the process run smoother.\n\n76#Looking back to move forward|I wanted to say thanks again to you two for the Q1 Project Review meeting you led this week. Great initiative on your part and well executed. You facilitated an open discussion to review a good sampling of projects the Customer Marketing team submitted in Q1. You shared the purpose of the meeting well in advance. You then shared the list of projects we'd be reviewing well in advance and then during the meeting, you kept us on track and kept the conversation flowing. The QBRs that we've started hosting are good because they give us time to dig into program results but this was a different type of review with broader perspective. I genuinely appreciated hearing different POVs from the program owners, but also our SMEs from Creative, Project Management, Content and Analytics. It was a new approach and I look forward to making it part of our strategic planning discipline going forward. Well done, John and Wamby! Thank you for your leadership.\n\n77#It takes a village|Sam, Biz, Anthony, Mark and Wamby, We have had an interesting three months getting to know each, working together, and building a plan.  Over this time, we have done things well, fumbled at times, and we have always had the best interests of Marketing and Workhuman in our mind.  Today was a big step.  Our promise to each other in early January was that we would build a plan that explained what we did, and do so with involvement from the entire team.  We did, and even added a few things over the past week while roles were shifting.  And I am so proud to see the cohesion across our plan, and the fun we have as human beings.  I am excited to see what we make happen in Q2 and the rest of the year.  Thank you, thank you for all you have done to get us to this point!  John\n\n78#Teamwork Truly Does Make Dreamwork|A huge thank you to each of your for a fantastic whirlwind of an update.  I am so grateful for your preparation and willingness to answer tough rapid fire questions (due to time constraints ;-)).  This team is the backbone of the marketing organization. Your dedication to creating an agile digital marketing infrastructure designed for scale and growth, all the while doing your BAU, is awe-inspiring. THANK YOU for always keeping a sense of humor and your commitment to our team and our company. ONWARD.\n\n79#Team Value Creation|Much overdue, but so very deserving, is this recognition to this collective team of magicians who took a rudimentary, half-baked, error-riddled spreadsheet and turned it into a powerfully compelling secret weapon in the war for a more human workplace.      On behalf of my colleague Rob, the senior leaders who supported the concept and vision for the calculator, and all the sales reps who stand close lots of deals . . .  we all would like to express our deepest gratitude to this amazing set of teammates who came together to turn our vision into something so magical, so compelling, and so valuable for prospects who want to understand in hard $'s the impact our solution can have on their business results when considering an investment in the Workhuman Cloud.     John, your early understanding of our vision and ability to identify and procure the Adept Agency to help us got us off on the right foot.   Krista, you were with us in the very early days, helping us to scrape together a marketing plan and messaging to introduce and then create a deliverables off our v1.  Jay and Jon, your artistic talents helped ensure the final product had the look and feel we wanted, without compromising form or function.   Hillary, at the 11th hour, you came in and alleviated our fears and kept us on the right side of copyright and use agreements.     Finally, Christina . . . you've been the glue behind the entire effort.  Your project management talents  kept us on track, in alignment, while staying true to our scope and budget and keeping us honest and grounded with Rob's and my wild ideas and visions of creeping the scope.  Could not have done it without you all!  Early reviews are in - the Value Creation Calculator is making a big difference in our deals.   Galderma, JPL, Kraft-Heinz, Brookfield Properties, Ciox, Cytiva, Day & Ross, Health First, and State Street - just to name a few.  All new customers because in part of our ability to tell a strong, compelling story of value!\n\n80#Departmental Security Review|Hi folks,  Thanks so much for taking part in our first departmental security review as part of our ISO27001 work.   We're looking forwards to using the results of the questionnaire as a way to increase the security alignment across the organization and we really appreciate the time and effort that people took in their responses!   best regards, Dermot\n\n81#Wamby for the Win|Wamby! Thank you for your help with our Sparkies Ceremony. Not only did you step up to write a very thoughtful award for Anthony, but you helped with some last minute adjustments yesterrday to the show flow and then you didn't skip a beat when I called you in a panic needing to troubleshoot some Zoom issues I was having earlier in the day. When I realized I was failing at multi-tasking, you were there for me again when I asked if you would help run the slide show. This isn't the first time you've helped me with my tech woes and I suspect, it won't be the last. Thank you for being a great teammate and friend.\n\n82#Lights! Camera! ACTION!!|A great big long overdue thank you for all of the amazing work that was put into creating the GE - 17 yr partnership video! We will be sharing this with all GE stakeholders as part of our strategic marketing outreach campaign to win the RFP this year! Thank you to the video team for the long hours of editing and fine tuning. (sorry about all of the changes :/ ) And a big shout out to our amazing speakers who all submitted a lengthy list of \"takes\" necessary to provide the selection of content needed to put this together. And a special thank you to Christina, who diligently kept us ON point and ON schedule during a very busy time for all of us. The video came out great! Thanks for your contributions!!\n\n83#Problem Solving|Thanks so much for popping on a quick call this week to brainstorm how to iterate and improve the customer newsletter process and content. Diaries are jam-packed with lots of projects in the air. So greatly appreciate the time taken to hear viewpoints, ideate and discuss feedback in a super productive way! I think we landed in a good spot and excited for the future. Cheers to this great team!\n\n84#Yes Sir, can I help some more!|John, you have been a mountain of support for me over the past month, learning how we do things and guiding on new, better ways.  And you jumped in to help Sam, support Dianne and so much more, and always willing to do so on a moments notice.  You are always willing to do some more!\n\n85#Workfront guru to the rescue|John, thank you for helping me bring the integrated calendar back to life in Workfront. It’s becoming more and more important to capture all the great work that is happening live and this is just a start of what it will look like to share what’s going on cross functionally to allow teams to leverage each other’s work or simple provide awareness. I appreciate your endless excitement to find ways to make the tool work better for us!\n\n86#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n87#Presentation Powerhouse|On behalf of Rosette and myself, we want to thank you for jumping in at the 11th hour  to help Rosette prepare for her HRO Today Performance Management Session. While we may have been looking for design assistance at a late hour, you were able to problem solve in real time, provide slide options that fit the story, and give Rosette the support she needed to make it all come together. We appreciate your efforts and brain power in making this happen!\n\n88#Pioneer Squad|Thanks all for either being the first few people to complete and submit the speaking engagements request form in Workfront or for joining one of our first two speakers bureau office hours. Our hope is that the new process is both simple and useful to all areas of the business. You've helped to kick it all off by jumping in without hesitation and asking all the right questions. We look forward to your feedback as we continue throughout the year!\n\n89#Now that's how you lead!|Sam, John and Mark, Your leadership and organization came through loud and clear today on the Directors' Call.  We have a plan to make Martech Wow our customers, and to lead projects that drive exceptional value to Workhuman.  Your efforts, and putting up with pickiness, is deeply appreciated!  John\n\n90#Team data|Thank you for spending time this week outside of your current workload to gather historical data to help inform decisions for our future work. I appreciate your time and dedication. Cheers!\n\n91#Thank You Tuesday Zoomers!|Thank you for joining our Zoom-around last week! It was great to spend some time together as a group like this. While Zoom is certainly no substitute for a good meal together, the conversation was lively and more importantly - allowed us to learn more about everyone's time travel preferences!\n\n92#New SFDC Campaign Process|John, Thank you for offering your Workfront expertise and joining multiple working sessions to build out the new Salesforce campaign request process. You went above the initial ask and offered an innovative solution on how the program owners could submit campaign requests. An added benefit is that the new form will integrate with Salesforce eventually and streamline the process! Thank you for being more than willing to jump in, roll-up your sleeves, and work through this new process with me.\n\n93#Jumping in immediately to help!|John, I received a very kind note from Rosette who mentioned the work you did today.  She would have preferred to create this nomination herself, however, as a contractor is unable to do so.  And she asked me to pass this note along.  “Tomorrow I am speaking at a Perf Management conference.  This was an 11th hour event and I knew I had limited design resources due to Ignite and little time as we are launching IBM on Monday.    As life would have it another colleague had other priorities to handle.  So I spoke with John, and he said, “Let me help you” and he delivered!  I am sharing this email to say what a great team player John is.  And since I can’t send him a gratitude I wanted to ask if you could on my behalf (which is acceptable per our company policy).”  John, thank you being the consummate teammate!\n\n94#\"Got your back\" is in his name.|John, as we head into 2021, I wanted to send a huge thanks for all your support over this whacky year. Through all the shifts, changes, late nights and weekends, you, your calming influence and your spectacular facial hair were there, helping me and the creative team navigate whatever Covid marketing challenges that came down the pike. Really appreciate your way of working hard, keeping it light, and always making it human. That's what Respect for Teamwork is all about. Here's to ya, buddy. Cheers!\n\n95#Putting in the work|Team - on behalf of Patti and myself, we wanted to say, \"Thank you\" and recognize the teamwork, collaboration, and effort you've collectively put in to moving our Pulse Survey action plans forward from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Together, we've made great quarter over quarter progress due to your efforts. This is an \"above and beyond\" initiative you've stepped up to lead. In doing so, you are each playing a leadership role for your marketing colleagues and peers - and - making a meaningful contribution to Patti, Tyler, and myself in building an amazing employee experience. This type of work is not the kind you can do \"every so often\" or \"sometimes\" and expect to achieve progress. It takes ongoing focus, a solutions-based outlook, courage and candor to build and sustain a great employee experience. Thank you for putting in the work - we look forward to continued advancements as we turn the page to 2021! With gratitude, -C\n\n96#Dream Team|Team- what an incredible ride we have had this year!  When I think about all of the work we have done together, all of the groundwork we have laid, as a team, to create the iconic brand we know we are - I am in awe.  Each of you has stretched yourselves, tried new and intimidating tasks and responsibilities, and have never lost your grace and humanity. I am proud to work alongside you and to call you my friends.  Happy Holidays to you all.  Here's to an even better, out-of-this-world 2021!!\n\n97#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n98#Dream Team!|Taking a moment to thank you for all your support, mentorship, and hard work. Each of you has gone above and beyond in our web and rebrand projects and I can’t thank you enough. You’ve continued to impress me with your skills, teamwork, and determination all while having a great attitude. Each day I’m thankful to be part of such a great team. Here’s to ending 2020 strong and continuing all of our amazing work into 2021!    (ps - this image would be way better as a gif, Biz - can you fix the internet so we can add those here? thanks - appreciate you)\n\n99#Pioneers and Innovators for ABM 2021|Wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has contributed to the evolution and strategic approach for our sales priority accounts.    A lot of time, thought, and effort has gone into taking our messaging and strategy to the next level as we work with some of our top tier opportunities, including recently with Raytheon and SalesForce.  This new collaborative process will help drive engagement into some of our most sought-out accounts, with the potential to change the landscape for Workhuman!  Please pass this gratitude along to anyone not the list, or potentially outside of our org (thinking of our freelancers who have been called on to elevate their work to ensure best-in-class messaging)!  Cheers, all!\n\n100#Lights, Camera, Action Groups!|Team - Z and I want to thank you all for your work getting the Pulse Survey Action Groups kicked off. Your ideas we so thoughtful and well crafted for the short window we gave you. We are beyond impressed! As Chris said, this is hugely important work and it is ongoing. We are excited to continue our partnership with you as we build and develop out these programs! We are grateful for you all!\n\n101#Speaking Engagments Form|John, thanks for taking the lead on creating the speaking engagments request form in Workfront. This will allow Amanda and I to track requests and engagment details like topic areas and audience size/levels in a more consistent manner. Thanks for taking the time to walk through the process to ensure it’s simple but aligned to our reporting needs.\n\n102#Quick turn request|Thank you all for your collaboration and focus on a quick turn request to create an overview doc to support C suite outreach. Ilana for your messaging suggestions, John and Dianne for getting it kicked-off and keeping it on track, Lauren for your quick copy writing, and Carrie for bringing it over the finish line with great layout and design. Thank you!\n\n103#The Workhuman brand experience|A brand is an alchemy of identity, emotion, experiences, charisma – the soul of the company and the products it makes. Remove any of these factors you’re left looking at only part of the picture. Unless you look at how people interact with a company and its products, you don’t have a holistic picture of the brand. The experience is cohesive and purposeful though brand identity, marketing communications, physical environments and product experiences. I'm so grateful to partner with you and your teams to create the total Workhuman brand experience. Bridging the gaps between product and brand and ultimately designing those cohesive experiences that create strong emotional connections in order to build trust, drive preference, and ultimately create affinity. Because of you, this has been one of the best collaborative initiatives I've had the pleasure of working on at Workhuman and can't wait to see it all come to life!\n\n104#Like a good neighbor...|John, thank you for stepping in and helping out on a few key initiatives while I was on Holiday. With so many spinning plates, timing wasn't ideal for me to get away but I'm so grateful that you were able to support me and keep those plates in the air until I got back! It meant the world to me to get some good ol' r&r, I hope I can do the same for you someday.\n\n105#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n106#Demo Dream Team!|Anne, Erin, Ilana, Rachel and John wanted to thank you for all the work you all put into making our customer demo a success yesterday! There were (very) tight timelines, competing priorities, a product launch, a computer that wouldn't start up, and so many other things ahead of this event that could've derailed the demo but nothing stopped this team. I appreciate all the work you all put into making this a great event for our customers. It went off without a hitch and I can't thank you all enough for your help! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n107#Have a Minute? ... And Much More|When I was approached with pulling together a plan and resources for a short-form video series to provide education on “who we are and what we do,” each of you stepped up in a big way to make it happen. The “Have a Minute” video series showcases different Workhuman themes that not only educate, but humanize our brand. From simply answering the question, “Who is Workhuman?,” to articulating why the annual review is not enough, to discussing the differences between employee engagement and employee experience, to promoting the new book, Live Online, and Workhuman Certified – “Have a Minute?” has provided a punchy, quick lens into our business through our humans. Whether you have been behind the scenes with video, script writing or reporting, in front of the camera, or hosting the series (that’s you, Patti), I appreciate the time, energy, and focus you bring to the program. We’ve learned a lot from this approach, and have some excellent ideas in the queue for making this bigger and better. Thanks for contributing to our mission to make work more human for every person around the globe.\n\n108#Are the forefront of Workfront|Hey John. Recently I was getting very frustrated trying to navigate and be productive using workfront. It's a very complicated tool that has many capabilities but isn't always easy to find the right thing you need. It also doesn't help that I was working in an old version and didn't know it. You took the time to reengage my dashboard and walk me through some newer and more efficient views. Thank you for your help and helping me work better!\n\n109#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n110#GTM elevated to a new standard|Team, to say I am proud of each and every one of you for the work you did to bring Certified to market - well,  it would be an understatement.  In bringing this program to market, your commitment to success, to each other, and to our customers was visible. You drove never-before practiced approaches including taking integrated launch to a whole new level of collaboration and stakeholder management, you delivered incredible market research, a beautiful web experience, and so much more.  Congratulations to you.   I will miss our 8 am's!\n\n111#I see you|John, Dianne, Angela, Brian, and Christina - I just want you to know that I see how hard you are working every day to keep hundreds of parts moving on hundreds of different projects. Not only are you doing this during a major crunch time for everyone with the impending broadcast of Workhuman Live Online next week, but all of you are also working toward earning your PMP certification in addition to everything else on your plates. I appreciate the staggering breadth of what you do for this team - and particularly as it relates to my projects. I am in back and forth communication with each of you on a regular basis and I know I'm not the only one. From 8 a.m. meetings to site launchings to new projects floating in with quick turnarounds, it's head-spinning what you juggle, while also weighing in on a higher level and keeping tasks on track. I just want you to know that I am truly in awe of all that you're accomplishing. Thank you for being so awesome and so very dedicated.\n\n112#Mid-Market Demo Success!|Thank you team for making today's Mid-Market Demo the most successful demo to date!  We doubled the registrations from last event (69) and almost doubled the attendance of the last two events combined(29)!!!!  Hence the Mighty Mouse reference, we may be a smaller team but we are mighty!  It was no easy feat to accomplish in a short matter of time and you all played a vital role!  Securing a customer to speak,  updating landing pages, creating Linked In Elevate Posts, pushing out invites, following up on said invites, driving attendance and so many more steps I am most likely forgetting!!!    THANK YOU!\n\n113#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n114#Demo Greatness!|Congratulations on delivering our first product demo as part of our ongoing demo program! You hit it out of the park providing a polished, engaging, and valuable webinar experience for our prospects. You've set the bar high for the program and I can't wait to see what's next.\n\n115#Presentation next level|John thank you very much for helping take my boring Powerpoint and helping update it to the next level. The changes make a big difference that help to capture, and tell, an important story. Thank you!\n\n116#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n117#Taking the reigns|John, thank you for your involvement in the heavy lifting the team has done to get the October event   stood up. You tirelessly come back to the basics again and again so the various groups and individuals of the larger team don't stray off course. You words and your work matter. Keep it up. Cheers!\n\n118#The PM Santa Claus of Christmas in July|John, thank you for taking time out of your Sunday to not only print out the massive amount of materials needed to prepare for the PMP (the box is about as heavy as a cinder block), but also personally delivering them to the each member of the Project Management team. This along with your support in getting the necessary online training gives us a great head start on our preparation for this notoriously difficult exam. It was also a great chance to see you and meet Leia, if only for a few minutes (while practicing proper social distancing techniques)!\n\n119#Keeping us aligned!|Team, thank you so much for all your support and excellent project management since we have been WFH. I have had the opportunity to work with each of you in the past few months, and you've all done an amazing job keeping our teams aligned. We wouldn't be able to launch our programs successfully if we didn't have the support you all provide. From Livestream, Demo, Sales Microsites, Display ads, Field Marketing Campaigns, Demand Gen, Events, the list can go on. Also, being able to pivot on project assignments as we onboard our new team member was so helpful. Our team is grateful to have such a supportive group to reign in all the efforts. You guys do an amazing job day in and day out and I truly enjoy working with you all. Keep up the awesome work!\n\n120#Five Star Results|Team, you recently took on the challenge to respond to App Store reviews and the results were immediate and outstanding! Working together to read reviews, coordinate responses and put the plan into action resulted in a user updating a one star review to FIVE stars! Fantastic work and an amazing win-win for us and the customer!\n\n121#Last minute request support|Thanks for pitching in on a VERY last minute request for the HR Pulse magazine fall issue!\n\n122#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n123#Creating a pathway to what's next|Chris, John, James, Maureen, and Owen - the executive team was thrilled when I shared the \"What's Next\" brief, story evolution, and campaign design today. Thank you for creating a way for us to evolve our story sharing to both inspires and enables our prospects and customers to truly Workhuman. This campaign represents an important evolution in many respects.  Your teamwork with each other and with your stakeholders is exactly how we collectively transform our brand trajectory.  Thank you!  Patti\n\n124#Putting the \"Lift off\" in \"Kick off\"|Team - as workplaces everywhere contemplate the next phase of work, we are leading the way in what that looks like externally and with our customers. It also means we need to evolve internally. I was so impressed by the team work and open mindedness demonstrated by this cross-functional group in today's kick off! So, as they say, \"Houston, we have lift off!\" Excited to see where this group takes the next phase of what it means to thrive and workhuman. With gratitude, -C\n\n125#What Makes Us Human: Heart and Soul|Team, when most of us are feeling defeated, deflated, and hopeless, each of you came together to unite our hearts and souls with the people we most want to reach. I shed more than one tear experiencing the imagery and messages of hope and pragmatism. Your respect, empathy, and compassion for all hearts and souls inside and outside of our company has made an impact.  Thank you for transforming a sad exception to our lives into one that brings us together instead of dividing us all.  As always, thank you for your hard work and determination to Workhuman. Best, Patti\n\n126#Crash course on getting to know you|John - I just want to say I've really enjoyed my crash course on getting to know you this week. When I came back from leave in the summer of last year, I didn't get to work with you much at first but throughout our interactions talking about process, excel templates, calendars, and being desk/row neighbors, I was able to get to know you on a personal level and I really do see you for the compassionate and driven leader you are. Fast-forward to this week, and I've finally had the pleasure of getting to work with you on the BLM campaign which has been such a delight! Things are moving fast, but your communication style is both poignant and effortless, with a dose of humor that I always appreciate and admire. Thank you for keeping me informed when I need to be, giving great feedback, and for bringing yourself into all that you do. It's been a really nice treat working with you on this and I am looking forward to more\n\n127#the hub at the center of so many spokes|John – You are at the center of so many initiatives, you take the time to make sure the right people are involved, and you ask good questions so we're making smart decisions, not just quick ones. When you called me today to sort out a quick turn request, it wasn't for a high profile project, but you still took the time to make sure we were getting it right. Thank you for all you do to keep marketing on the rails heading in the right direction. And, not only that, but for fixing my workfront dashboard so I can stay on top of my projects!\n\n128#True Grit and a Whole Lotta Awesome|John, Chris, and Maureen - WOW! You ARE the innovation equation. Thank you for jumping in and creating a world class story to share about going back to the office. This next phase of the pandemic, from a business perspective, is filled with as many unknowns as we had a few months ago. The challenge is that business leaders and HR are fatigued, their people are fatigued, and their customers are fatigued. What you have quickly and expertly enabled is a dialogue, a new conversation based on empathy and respect, that may trigger a new and much-needed new conversation about innovation, employee experience, and joy in the workplace. THANK YOU!\n\n129#Workfront Doctors!|Christina and John, thanks for your time this week trying to diagnose my Workfront loading issues. Appreciate your  patience and help trying to devise workarounds while we work through the diagnosis!  Thanks for being great champions of the tool and helping me get a bit more productive again!\n\n130#Fierce commitment to urgency|\"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there IS such a thing as being too late. This is not time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.\" - MLK JR.   Team, since I started just over a month ago, I have heard from many of you and our stakeholders who have talked about the misfortune of joining Workhuman during a global pandemic that has changed every thing about how we live: from how we interact, to what we spend our time and money on, what we value, and how we work.  The truth is, there was no better time for me to be able to witness the magic that is Workhuman. We already know what is important and that is human connection. What you have demonstrated is humanity during a time of extreme urgency - a rarity in life and certainly in business. Thank you for your passion for your and your commitment to each other and our stakeholders.  I am honored to work alongside each of you.\n\n131#Project Management’s Obi-Wan Kenobi|The past couple of weeks have been among the busiest I’ve encountered while at Workhuman, but there have been several moments during that time that have once again demonstrated to me what an amazing privilege it is having you as the leader of our PM team. You always have our back, available to discuss any issue or opportunity that arises, provide advice or just keeping us laughing in our morning “face-to-face” team meetings. At the start of the Moodtracker go-to-market campaign you helped set up a new Agile way of working in Workfront, focused on the excitement of the opportunity rather how daunting the road ahead was. This new agile approach guided our daily sprints and provided a visual representation of the progress the team was making. Throughout the entire campaign I never doubted I had your support, and you didn’t hesitate to jump in whenever an assist when needed. You truly are the Jedi Master of Project Management, an amazing leader and a great friend. Thank you!\n\n132#Rock solid PM team!|Team, You have been in major communication with our Marketing teams organizing huge campaigns for the company over the past several weeks. You haven’t taken a day off or taken part in all the self care activities happening. You worked extra hours to pull off some amazing things, managing every detail along the way. There have never been so many big initiatives launching at the same time and making such a huge impact in the company and the world at a time like this. Who knew 2020 was going to the year for Workhuman to take it beyond the next level! I just wanted to take a moment to recognize you for all your hard work and achievements that are coming to fruition over the next week+ for Livestream, Moodtracker, CSR and more! You let me lean on you to take the big dogs, while I’ve been helping to keep the smaller projects moving. This has allowed me to maintain my sanity while parenting solo, teaching, and working. I’m so proud to have you by my side proving the strengths of project management in everything you do! Thank you for being strong teammates especially when I needed you the most.\n\n133#Synchronizing our Story|The biggest of creative and project management shout outs to this team of inspirational teammates! We have a big opportunity with a customer this week to tell our story. I reached out to the world (to a LOT of people---my bad) and the world sent me back this fine group! Your creativity and design is EXACTLY what we needed and you really WOW'd me with how beautifully and quickly delivered. I recognize how many competing priorities everyone is balancing and it means SO much that you could help me help the team. MERCI BEAUCOUP! You're brilliant!\n\n134#All systems go!|This group rallied mid week in an incredible pivot from soft launch to just LAUNCH within hours. I cannot thank you enough for the commitment to urgency for launching media campaigns.\n\n135#Thank You Healthcare Images - Weekend Worriors|Thank you all for jumping in to take part in the logo and image sourcing and uploading for hospitals into the Thank You Healthcare site!  Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring! Thank you also to each of you who dedicated an hour, several hours and in some cases most of the weekend to sourcing and uploading!  We so appreciate your efforts!  Many hands make light work, my mother used to say! I do want to call out a few of you who really made an incredible dent in the project uploading and sourcing between 70 and 230 images each and in many cases hitting both uploading and sourcing!  WOW!  Brian Moore, Matt Durgin, John Wamback, Jon Bizeur, Amanda Salvas, Rich Sorrentino, Jillian Gregoriou and Dan Fiore, you guys are complete rock stars and your contributions were mammoth! This was a true team effort and to see it in action makes me so proud to be a part of our Workhuman family!  Amazing job! Let’s share some gratitude with the world now!\n\n136#Check that box|When I started to hear about people being shifted to new temporary roles I said to myself 'hmmm, is this for the PM team?'. But I should have know you already had it covered for your team. Being a project manager means shuffling resources all day long, and you had met with us on week 1 of remote life to make sure we had a balanced workload before it was even a thing. I appreciate that you were watching out for us and checking in with us. Thank you for your mindful leadership.\n\n137#PMs in the AM, PM, and pretty much 24/7|Team - Quick note to say thank you and recognize your willingness to react and respond to the needs of the business. In fluid times, bringing order to chaos is critically necessary - You've been there to help establish and maintain important guardrails of deadlines, owners, and quality - it's fun to go fast, but it's more fun to go fast and do things well. Thanks for helping to bring some \"Law & Order\" and organization to this busy busy time. It's making a difference, creating discipline, and establishing playbooks we can leverage for the next fast break initiative. Thank you for all you're doing - it matters and makes a difference. With gratitude, -C\n\n138#Project Management Masters!|Christina, Brian & John - thank you so much for all the work that you do! I haven't worked with either you in terms of PM until these last 2 weeks. And it has been such a great experience! Whether its slack IM's, Zoom calls, Slack video calls, or email you three are always there for me! When all these projects going around it is so nice at how much attention you give us! You have all been instrumental in getting all of our assignments tracked, on time, and executed. The work that you guys do is so helpful for us and I am so grateful! I cannot wait to keep working with you all more and also becoming more of a WF Queen! :) Thank you thank you!\n\n139#Visualizing Pros!|John, Brian, Carrie, Naomi and Dave - thanks to the outstanding partnership you brought to our multiple working sessions, we now have a Continuous Performance Management Annual Calendar 1-Page visual we can share with prospects seeking to build internal consensus on the how of Agile PM in Conversations.   Recently, Naomi, Dave and I had the opportunity to share the editable assets you created with our Conversations COE and the team was most impressed and appreciative.   Our future Conversations customers will have you to thank for helping them more easily make the case for change.\n\n140#It started with you!|John, I just wanted to thank you for your lighting fast response and help in getting the Takeda project request going. It started with our very first email / Workfront request and I'm certain it would not have delivered by the deadline if you and I had not connected from the get go. So... THANK YOU!\n\n141#8:45am - sunshine and smiles!|This week has been an amazing opportunity for us three to connect on a level like never before. Every morning, 8:45am, I'm greeted with sunshine and smiles from you both. Me eating my cereal, us talking about the night before and the day ahead, I've loved our banter, our camaraderie, and our candor. Together, we are a great team and by the floods of recognition for your team members, your leadership is speaking louder than words. I'm incredibly proud of you both. Hope you have an incredible weekend and I'll see you bright and early on Monday 8:45am!\n\n142#Your moved mountains....|Friends, I feel like we all just got a bit closer today! I literally cannot say enough for your help on the Customer product launch email today. You all had the highest level of collaboration, focus, detail and most importantly, what is the best thing to do for our customers. I think our end result was fabulous. I thank my lucky stars I get to work with superstars, all. day. long.\n\n143#And Thank YOU, team!|I wanted to recognize you all for being a part of the amazing Healthcare Thank you Video we launched to our customers and social channels yesterday afternoon. This was both a great initiative to showcase our respect for our customers and all members in the healthcare industry, as well as such a great team collaboration. Each and every one of you played a crucial part in making this so successful.   I was personally excited and touched by this video since I have so many family members and close friends in the front lines, and I'm so excited to share with them to brighten their day!\n\n144#Delivering the Human Touch|When the COVID-19 pandemic began to accelerate, our marketing instinct immediately went to providing a human face on our content. There is no more powerful thought leadership than humans speaking with humans – sharing experiences, emotions, and best practices on how best to craft a path forward in these unprecedented times. That was the inspiration for the daily video series, “Keeping Work Human,” which launched last week amid the flurry of everything else we are working on. James and Matt – you stepped up and deftly handled the logistics of turning a Zoom video conference call into usable, shareable video. Pam – you project-managed the overall logistics, setting up the invites, and showing agility when we had to pivot. Amy – you immediately energized your team to schedule guest speakers. Mike – you were at the ready to transition the videos to Workhuman Radio podcasts. Sarah and Jess – you stepped up to write the question frameworks and provide a content resource. John and Diane – you saw what was happening and introduced better discipline and process. Jen – you were our first guest and dazzled our viewers with unique leadership best practices to manage remote teams. And Steve – our host – your ability to set the tone, and keep our guests at ease with your authenticity and humble heart, is what makes it all work. We’ve only just begun – and we have a busy few weeks ahead – but I couldn’t be prouder of this team and the messaging we are bringing to market.\n\n145#Leaning on the Experts|Guys, I really appreciate your support over the last few days as we worked through the details of the video series. Thank you for sharing your input on how this should work, look, and be delivered to the audience. We’re moving so fast and making decisions quickly, and doing that well is only possible when we trust the team around us. I’m extremely grateful to each of you for sharing your expertise!\n\n146#The Daily French Digest!|Team, A huge thank you for your quick work and endless pivoting on the construct of the daily existing customer email communications. Alice, Eileen, Traci, Chris and Kevin, wordsmith-ing at its finest! You worked super hard to get this first intro email to a great place and really helpful leadership direction and vision! John, I don't know what we would do without your stellar PM skillz! Lauren and Moe, quick turns on the brainstorms and thank you for the light hearted moments when I needed them most! Jess and Meghan, your help on list building, direction and ensuring our reporting is in line - so important! And finally, Anthony, thank you for burning the midnight oil with me. What I asked of you wasn't super 'Workhuman' and I cannot thank you enough for juggling what you did to get the communication out! Thank you all for your commitment to this project!\n\n147#Sharing is caring|High 5s to you 5 fine humans! Why you ask? I pulled together a marketplace update over the weekend but with more than a dozen companies to track, I knew I could not do it alone. I asked the marketing leaders who could help out and Dan and John - you both didn't blink raising your hand to chip in. Dan - your team is cranking out thoughtful content every day but you generously offered to let Jess H help with this. John - first you said you could ask your team to help but then you decided to take on the extra workload yourself! Jess - you were quick, thorough and proactively reached out to me with your specific updates throughout the week. But, as the week went on and our COVID related scope of work kept growing, I knew I had to reassess how we resourced the efforts so that we could provide timely updates to Sales and the entire organization. Pam - I went to you next and asked if I could enlist Mark's help. And you too, didn't hesitate a second. You quickly talked to Mark and followed up to tell me he'd be in touch. Within hours, Mark not only proactively reached out to me for the download but he took the project on with ease and enthusiasm and delivered a new update of today's marketplace COVID related activity Hugely valuable. Thank you all! I love this team and this great example of teamwork at its finest.\n\n148#Everyone needs a rock...I've got a few!|Over the past few days, we've been working more closely together than ever before. Things are moving at a rapid pace, there's a constant fire hose of new ideas and projects, changing direction....plus the shared learning curve of how to be the most productive yet communicative and inclusive while we all embrace working remotely. It's been a roller coaster ride of emotions and I wanted you to know how grateful I am to be on this ride with you two. Thank you for being excellent strategic partners. In more ways than one, you've kept me sane - well, SOMEWHAT sane. ;-)\n\n149#Quick strike team|Hi all - thank you for your tireless collaboration today on all of the different email communications that we're putting out into the world. You've each been wonderful to work with - Jill and Z, providing clarity of direction; Lauren being quick with all the words; John, keeping the tasks organized and all of us on track... Great teamwork, respect for urgency and respect for quality all around. I love that amidst uncertainty - we can still shine! (yep, that was cheesy and i don't care)\n\n150#Be the glue|At then end of a very long 2 days of a long week in a stressful time... thank you for taking a few minutes to talk to me this afternoon. Your calm manner is valuable. Thank you for being a listening manager. Continue to be glue that holds us together as a marketing department.\n\n151#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n152#Team Corona|Coronavirus.  Covid-19.  A giant headache.  We all call it something different – especially because the situation with it has been changing minute by minute and making our decision making process so challenging.  When we made the decision to create new content and FAQ’s for our Workhuman Live site and audiences at 8PM on a Friday night, I crossed my fingers we would be able to activate.  We needed to get information out to our audiences that was clear, consistent, and valuable to ensure they felt informed and at ease.  No surprise – every single one of you stepped up.  Dianne was slacking me almost immediately with project set-up details and timelines.  Lauren had copy in my hands before 6:00 AM (you actually sent it at 1:30!?!)  Chris and Amy were both there to review, edit and get on the phone to talk it through.  Jon had site pages staged and new pop-up functionality built and staged Saturday morning.  Jen and Anthony had layouts and content ready to deploy.  Jill was providing copy strategy and reviews.  Holly and Anne were standing by ready to act as needed for our audiences.  And Lauren – our guiding light and champion of strategy supporting the whole process was as responsive as ever with reviews and feedback.  This is such an evolving and fluid situation, but the team never ceases to amaze me.  You gave up family and weekend time to help ensure our customers had the information they needed, when they needed it.  Your continued dedication and respect for customers, urgency, quality, and teamwork is amazing.  Thank you – and Cheers to Team Corona.\n\n153#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n154#Easy as pie|John, you have a way about you that makes everything you’re working on seem as easy as pie. There have been some small things here and there that needed some fixin’! You tackled a bunch of things for me and the team over the past week and I wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your attention to all these details. Setting up a PM team meeting to make sure we are all setting up projects consistently, working on new dashboards to display our request queue, fixing the proofing issue, and endless training meetings to rollout the new ways of working as well as Workfront training to teams outside of Marketing. Thanks for all your support and positive attitude!\n\n155#Making work(flow) human|John, Brian, Angela, Dianne, Christina, and Michael - I have to give your team a shout out for all the communicating you do around projects and schedules on a constant basis. And especially for my own schedule, to have such a caring group of humans always having an eye on my workload is a godsend. This week especially, each of you has done something to shift deadlines in a way that's made my work manageable. Each of you has asked me on multiple occasions if I am okay and what can you do to help. I can't tell you how much I appreciate all of you, your devotion to keeping workflow efficient and human, and the sense of positivity and calm you bring to our department. You're helping all of us do our best work and that's deserving of all the praise in the world.\n\n156#Thank you / Thank Gu|Daisy, Dana, Genessa, Jen, John, Kristen, Mary, Sara & Vahagn - thank you all for you support sending follow up note to the sales team following Ignite. It was great to have this team lend creativity to help us send a thoughtful note, along with some Gu, to the team. Thank you - or I should say thank Gu.\n\n157#Diplomacy at its best|John I wanted to recognize you for the outstanding presentation you gave to the marketing group today, as you walked us through the big vision regarding our new ways of working. The basics were presented in a digestible way, and with your trademark friendly and matter-of-fact tone. You made everyone feel included and heard, which set the room at ease - a very challenging thing to do with our group! I think we all realize that this is the first step of many, as we go forward, but I was so reassured walking out of there that you and the project management team will help us get where we all want to go.\n\n158#Ignite photography|John, Thank you for your help securing the photographer to capture the activities at Ignite Boston. It was a long shot list and I’m looking forward to seeing everything and sharing with employees. Really appreciate your help finding the person and sorting all that out in advance and your help with the activities on site too.\n\n159#A Good Night with a Few Good Men...|Amidst the blur of the pace of life, it is always nice to slow life down for a bit and connect about the ties that bind and the moments that really matter-and in the process learn something that you would not have otherwise known. Thank you for the honor and privilege of your company and for the camaraderie that will not end just because our dinner did.\n\n160#Enriching the SLC experience for winners|Colleen and John, thank you both for your help in creating a great experience for all of this year's Sales Leadership Club nominees.  Arranging for photos to be captured in the moment, combing through them all to pick suitable one's right away, editing/advising/enhancing other elements of the messaging and helping identify the best way to make the awards real.  And when we hit minor bumps in the road - John with the mystery of the missing photo and Colleen with the impromptu use of your own phone - you each stepped in right away to help. Thank you for being such great collaborators.\n\n161#Lights! Camera! It's the final countdown!|John, I truly appreciate all the work you did securing our photographer for the corporate headshots from beginning to end. Glenn was a huge hit with everyone who interacted with him, and I'm so excited to see the end result. What I'm most proud of is the way you helped get the last slideshow of the event up before the curtain closed! What a close call, but you did it and it was the perfect way to close out our Ignite. Thanks for being such an incredible team player.\n\n162#Being Human|One of my favorite parts of our yearly Ignite program is the dine arounds. It’s a chance to spend time with our fellow humans in an informal setting, with no rush, no pressure, just humans connecting. Last night, this paid off in spades. I want to say a heartfelt “thank you” to each one of you for being your authentic self! I loved the free-flowing conversations we had, the opportunity to learn more about each one of you, to share our similarities, and to find out what makes each of us unique. It’s experiences like this that make me proud to work with all of you at Workhuman.\n\n163#Efficiencies give me LIFE!|I want to THANK YOU for taking time to meet and brainstorm on assets to incorporate into the Project Management process. It has been great partnering with you and experiencing how you ALWAYS keep an open mind and value opinions/feedback.  It's a breath of fresh air and I am so excited to be a part of the PM team and the great things our team is going to do in 2020!\n\n164#New form, who dis?|John, my first time working directly with you has been such a delight. Thank you for your openness and responsiveness to helping the comms team centralize any and all speaking asks. Within one day you were showing us a newly created form on Workfront, which for the time being will allow us to report more easily and accurately on all internal and external engagements.  I look forward to working with you more this year.\n\n165#Go team!|John, you assembled this team faster than the avengers, and every bit as strong. Your expertise in this area has already helped drive so much positive change - thank you for trailblazing. Angela and Dianne, you have achieved Ol'G status - thank you for all you've both done for the team in your time here and have shown tremendous leadership in onboarding everyone else. Brian, its never a simple task to shift your focus area, it takes a lot of courage and hard work to do this, and you do it with kindness and positivity. Michael and Christina, you both have been here for like, a month or less - and already I'm so impressed at the focus, energy, and expertise you bring to projects & discussions. 2020 is shaping up to be a great year!\n\n166#Wamback has our backs|John, I want to thank you for your tireless efforts around putting the right processes and workflows in place to make it easier to do our best work. Since you’ve been here, you’ve taken huge steps to improve the way we work together, to shed light on what’s necessity and what’s self-imposed, and to ease the burden of those who are over-scheduled. You’re slowly but surely turning the chaos into calm, and I so appreciate you for this. Not to mention, your understanding and empathy. You always come at everything with a compassionate ear and a solutions-driven mind. So glad you’re here. We needed you.\n\n167#Dream Team!|John, Thank you for planning and leading our first team offsite last week. You have project management skills after all ;-) It was great to step away from projects to talk about our job and how we can best support our teammates in marketing and beyond. It was helpful to see all the presentations you've developed to clarify our roles. It is so great to have a team and other PM brains to hang out with. Cheers!\n\n168#Merck Email test.... and we're live!|Thank you to this all-star team for your incredible contributions in getting our first Redemption Reminder email test live!!  As a small but mighty team, you guys persevered through unchartered territory, navigating so many unknowns, obstacles, setbacks and changes, and ultimately got this first test live and out to the Merck US population (during peak holiday season no less, which is a huge window to impact!)  Now, not only do we have a sparkly new templates, processes and testing methodology to build on, but we also have AMAZING early results to start diving in to (hello 30% open rate on Day 1!) to learn more about how we can leverage the Email Channel to improve the customer experience and achieve our collective business goals.  Looking forward to continuing to partner with this group as we build out this program!!\n\n169#1st Annual Turkey Trot!|Wow!!!! From start to finish everyone on this team we're Rockstars! Jackie, you were the start of it all from coming up with not only a new tradition but an amazing new Workhuman Gives event we can add to our calendar! So many details went into the planning and execution of this event! Designing and ordering swag to packaging and selling shirts, everyone jumped in and helped out! Onsite this morning, we had the music jamming at 7:45AM ( Thanks Casey!) We got some great shots of the runners (we had over 100 participants!) Lauren you generously stepped up and took some professional photos to make sure we had some great memories of this event! We human arrows to make sure everyone stayed on the right track were bundled up and survived the cold weather! I cannot thank you enough!!!! Here is to another new tradition to add to all the others! Gobble Gobble!!!!\n\n170#Thank you for great referrals!|John - thank you for sending 2 great referrals my way for your Project Manager searches!  When we kicked off the search, you quickly combed your network, and reached out to some allstars.  You got 2 great candidates on the hook, and they were GREAT!  This is so helpful in recruiting, and we LOVE referrals at Workhuman.  They had great things to say about you, and quickly jumped at the opportunity to work with you again.  Thank you for always valuing relationships, and making them last.  You never know when paths will cross again!\n\n171#HIRED (x2)|John - congratulations on 2 brand new hires!  I am so excited for Michael and Christina to join your team.  Thank you so much for such great partnership during these searches.  Your honesty, positivity, guidance, responsiveness and prioritization were critical in making these 2 hires happen.  The process you selected was streamline and affective.  Thank you so much for giving each candidate (either over-the-phone or in-person) such a great candidate experience.  Each candidate had nothing but positive things to say about your conversations, and that is so important in attracting top talent!  YAY to 2 closed searches.  John, you are a great recruiting partner!\n\n172#Workfront in a hurry|Thank you SO much for making the Workfront html proof tool work on my machine!!! Being able to click through a website and make edits within the proofing tool is just magical – and I was in a hurry between meetings to get my edits to the team so we wouldn't lose time on the project (because when am I NOT rushing between meetings!). You were able to figure out how to make it work and update my proofing tool without needing to put in an IT ticket – and I am SO grateful! I would have lost an entire day on this project if I didn't have this tool working properly on my computer at just that time !!! thank you!\n\n173#Uncovered Company-Wide Tech Issue|Hi John,  From my first day here you equipped me with Workfront, only to have the \"Ground Hog Day\" effect where we needed to setup my account new each day! After digging deeper and working back and forth between Workfront and IT, you were instrumental in discovering the Single Sign On company-wide issue. Great patience and determination to get me (and others!) equipped to do our jobs!\n\n174#Kicking of Friday AM with some PM Inspiration|John - Thanks for a great project management brainstorming discussion this morning. I am really impressed with not only the ideas you are bringing to the table, but also the open dialogue you continue to have with Angela, Dianne and I. I'm very happy and excited to be part of this group, and can't wait to see what we can accomplish when we team up with the rest of Marketing and beyond. It was the perfect way to kick off a Friday and wrap up a productive week...I owe you some more gold coins!\n\n175#Successful Kick-off|John - thank you so much for recently taking the time to kick off your 2 newest Project Manager searches!  I'm so excited to be hiring for your team.  I loved working with you during your own hiring process, and things have come full circle.  This was the first time I kicked off our new job intake process.  Thank you for coming to the meeting so prepared, and for all of the information you shared with me.  I am confident in the hiring process we identified, and cannot wait to hit the ground running on this search!\n\n176#Thank you for the warm welcome!!|I meant to send this earlier this week, but I am still new to the system so apologies there! I finally found you though, and just want to send a big THANK YOU for the warm welcome and lunch earlier this week.  It was great to get some advice from you, and have you show me the way to the cafe next door. The small things make all of the difference, and you are part of the reason why it was such a great first week! THANK YOU!!!!!\n\n177#A new approach|After meeting with the three of you this week, I'm so excited of what's to come for our Benefits communications! I walked away from our meeting feeling inspired about the work we'll do together. I very much appreciate you all moving beyond the traditional and really helping me to think outside the box and push us further with this project (I can't wait to see the next version!).  As I review all the behaviors associated with Cultivating Innovation, the three of you displayed every single one in our meeting this week. Thank you for being great partners and approaching this project with positivity and creativity!\n\n178#Philips Demo Video|Hi Team, I just want to thank you for all your hard work in putting together the semi-custom video demo for our Philips pitch this week.

John, appreciate you running point on helping to orchestrate this along with the other projects the team had to make sure we had something in time to review, tweak and finalize before our pitch. Dan, thanks for the quick turnaround on incorporating their specific values into the site.  And James, thanks for giving the Workhuman solution a voice.  You collaborated with Marcy and I on the script so we could ensure we incorporated things like right to left languages, Workday, and multiple programs and you jumped right in to help us come up with a solution that could meet our timelines, but still make it a tailored experience.  Thank you - it made a tremendous impact day of and we will continue to use it going forward as we hopefully move into the next round of discussions.\n\n179#Grateful for your guidance|There was a moment yesterday where I was caught in the middle of a judgement call that had to be made. You got on the phone with me first thing in the morning to walk through the issue and help sort it out. There’s no way to please everyone, but you have a way of speaking to people that makes them feel respected and valued. You’ve been such a great mentor in your short time here offering solid advice and always making us feel supported. I’m grateful for everything you’ve done so far for our team. You have been a true advocate since day one.\n\n180#\"Clear is Kind\"|(Brene Brown) John - As you continue to champion the Project Management role, develop plans, and build a team of excellence - you often gather us to share the updates and ask for our input. This recognition is to thank you for the transparency. It allows us to walk the path with you, to feel a part of the plan, manages our expectations, and prevents a grapevine from growing. Way to lead and model collaboration!\n\n181#Desk dropping sparkles|Brian, Geoff, Niamh, Sara, Laury, Maureen, Austin and John —Thank you all for jumping in to help us add some magic into the office! Many hands made way less work (and time), especially when it comes to untangling lights (John takes the cake on this one- light extraordinaire). Thank you for staying late, for your respect for urgency (and teamwork), and for making this fun. I appreciate you all!\n\n182#Just a great human|John, just wanted to take a moment to recognize how thoughtful and kind you are. There has been a lot of change and you have approached each conversation, some confidential in nature, with respect and dignity. And looking out for the other humans has been so refreshing to see. Keep on being just a great human.\n\n183#Truly Imagination at Work!|Let me start by saying how grateful I am for this entire team for the collaborative efforts that you all put forth to design & deliver the gorgeous GE demo prototype to 25+ leaders at GE this week.  The feedback that I got from GE was \"the custom demo really made the difference\" and from a senior healthcare leader, \"really interesting & exciting...how do we get started!!\"  That is amazing feedback!  Special thanks to the marketing team for all of your hard work and creativity put into the custom demo AND the custom micro-sites that we are building together. To Dan Fiore who we refused to allow to enjoy his vacation :), to Sarah Whitman for attending and presenting at the meeting even though we only gave you 5 min to speak!

We are getting there, team!!\n\n184#Q4 style guide - Hello Gorgeous!|We asked, you delivered!  Maureen, John - thank you for your incredible work getting us to a place of reviewing a comprehensive style guide for Q4/holiday, and not to mention in August!

Well done! #gratitag\n\n186#Roses are red....|Violets are blue. The Healthcare campaign would be nothing without you. I truly appreciate the teamwork, energy and dedication that went into getting these healthcare ads back in market. A lot of back and forth, and lots of collaboration toward a share goal. Many thanks. I'm excited to see what the market has to say and start iterating on the awesome creative and copy!\n\n187#In good hands|Thank you both for your support on my projects while I was on vacation.

What a team!\n\n188#The Gratitude Effect|I am SO excited about where we are headed for our Gratitude Effect campaign.

You've also helped me really up my Workfront game, a process I hope will continue throughout 2019!\n\n190#Summertime!|Thank you team, for covering while I was on a much needed and very active vacation. It was great to be able to spend time with my family in the great outdoors, completely unplugged, before my daughter leaves for college. Precious moments that were possible because you both had it covered! I appreciate the extra efforts you put in to keep the traffic moving. Cheers!\n\n191#Hidden Talents|There wasn't a moment of hesitation by anyone when I asked \"do you want to help out and act in a video project?\" Which is one of my favorite parts about working here. You were all so willing and flexible to support a project for the video team. Just about all of you helped out acting, carrying equipment, and just generally doing whatever it took took to help us bring this little number to life. These are the kinds of projects that galvanize a team together through excitement, dedication, and the joy of the final result. I think the decision was pretty unanimous that we nailed it. Thank you everyone for your help and Andrea, I promise the next one you won't need crossed eyes.    No labradoodles were harmed in the making of this movie.\n\n192#Thank you!|Thank you for making a HUGE difference in my life of trying to progress many moments that matter for our future and current customers!

It’ll be a bumpy ride getting to our destination and there are sure to be some roadblocks along the way, but I’m feeling confident we can remove a bunch of these potholes that have been tripping us up.

Really appreciate the chess work you are doing in helping us all identify efficiencies (and gaps) across the groups!\n\n199#What a Brainstorm|There’s nothing like a three-hour meeting, sandwiched between the company meeting, a marketing vp meeting, and countless other commitments.  Yet, every one of you came with your A-Game – ready to brainstorm a whole new approach to the Workhuman Live website experience.  Thank you all for showing up focused, open-minded, and collectively in alignment on exceeding our audiences’ expectations through the site.
