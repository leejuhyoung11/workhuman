Do you know how awesome you all are? Do you know how special this relationship is that you have cultivated with Takeda? I sat back and watched Kim's face light up when she saw each of you. I saw hugs all around. From being on the other side of the equation, I can tell you that the usual emotions and behaviors on display in a vendor meeting are crossed arms, eye rolls, big sighs and cynicism. But of course not with this crew. Cause vendor who? We are partners and it shows. Clearly you put a lot of work into this account and these relationships. THEY LOVE YOU. This allowed for challenges (looking at you Paul) and the follow up questions (looking at you Amanda). You all have them thinking so strategically. It was such a joy to watch. The ideas and the love in that room. I am so impressed and proud to be one of this crew. I tried to tell you after the meeting and each of you responded with - oh yes, they are so great to work with. And they are great to work with. But friends, it's also you. You're amazing and you're great to work with and you GSD. Well done.\n\n5#Grateful for your dedication to our clients|Marie, Samar & Paul - It's amazing to see your dedication to our clients and unwavering commitment to demonstrating our value through the lens of what is most important to them.

I’m grateful to have you on our team and appreciate all you do!\n\n6#Syngenta Contract Renewal|Paul, congrats on getting Syngenta's contract renewal over the line... I know a lot of effort went into this and the negotiations were tough at times. Their procurement were asking for a lot of unreasonable things and there was a lot of back and forward on this, but you led from the front, pushed back where you thought necessary, and ultimately got them to agree to an early 2 year renewal that was favorable for both sides. I admire your persistence and professionalism shown here, well done...!\n\n7#Rio Tinto QBR|Thank you for the work to prepare and deliver the QBR for Rio Tinto this week.

We were informed of an issue with the core Thank You award template on the Catalyze program Tuesday evening, where a custom built back end template had aligned itself to the award and was going out to all employees receiving a Thank You award. CLS and CE teams jumped on late night calls to understand what had happened, which resulted in us putting the Thank You award temporarily on hold in Catalyze. After much collaboration, investigation, testing and retesting yesterday we were able to switch back on the award for AZ last night, confident this is now working as expected. I want to call out everyone's contribution here, as it was so vital to getting this resolved for AZ as quickly as we could, the internal response to resolving this issue was phenomenal.

Not only do you make time to answer my questions - from the simple to complex - you clearly think about how you can make an impact even after our conversation. I woke up this morning to well wishes and a link from you with intel that you thought might be useful for my first meeting with a customer today. That was such a thoughtful (strategic, creative, impactful - I could go on...) thing to do and it means so much Paul. I chose the value of quality here instead of teamwork because it is specifically the quality of your support that makes all the difference!\n\n40#Leading AZ to the next phase|Paul, I wanted to take a moment to recognise your huge win in extending AstraZeneca's partnership with Workhuman for 5 more years. It was a long and winding road to get there, requiring vast amounts of creativity and perseverance on your part. Over the last 12 months you expertly managed a challenging negotiation with multiple curve balls. In parallel, you coordinated across product, finance and eCommerce to ensure AZ's needs were heard. Throughout, you ensured I was supported in the day to day as we continue to build trust and foster growth at this customer. Thank you! Launched in a global pandemic, a new CHRO, a new program owner, supporting and recognising the humans developing and delivering a Covid vaccine and over half a million pounds donated to charity this program is ever evolving! Congratulations on getting this one across the line!\n\n41#Hang in there, You're doing AMAZING!|All, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the incredible work this team is doing everyday to support our largest customers!  I am beyond proud of each and every single one of you.  The value you each are bringing this organization and our clients is beyond measure.  It is a distinct privilege to get to see you in action, listen to your strategies to support our customers in all the right ways and see you succeed day after day.  It has been a rough go for a while now for a myriad of reasons and you all are absolute warriors.  You inspire and humble me with the creativity, fortitude and determination you all demonstrate.  Thank you for being uniquely you and for the contributions you bring to our customers and Workhuman.  Bravo!\n\n42#Making connections at Workhuman Live|A huge thanks for taking my clients under your wing at Workhuman Live and making them feel so welcome. It was a hard blow when I realised I wasn't going to make it, but a relief to know they would be in capable hands and wouldn't even miss me. Paul, perhaps it felt like you were herding cats, but thanks for being so willing to connect and engage with them over dinner. Jose, thanks for making this so personable that they already committed to next year, and your thorough debrief to bring me up to speed.\n\n43#It takes a Workhuman village! (part 2)|Last week was the culmination of the efforts by so many to bring the Executive Forum to life at Workhuman Live. Joining the team only 6 weeks before the event, I was blown away by the work ethic, camaraderie, and creativity of everyone involved. Your support, encouragement, and tireless commitment to the finished product (both during the final stretch of planning and onsite) far exceeded anything I could have ever imagined in a team, and your efforts were instrumental in delivering an impactful program for ExF members. Thank you for bringing the vision to life. It was a sincere pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.  With the craziness of the event, I fell a bit behind with recognition in the final 2 weeks leading up to the event. Please know - your contributions did not go unnoticed.   SCDs and Sales Teams – for your diligent efforts to fill the room and empower the most important Customers and Prospects to join the conversation. These efforts not only contributed to the success of this event, they also helped lay the foundation for future events and further development of our business relationships.   Meghan, Chris W, and Dave – for your diligent work facilitating and tracking customer experience and the growth account participation. I appreciate your keen eyes on the process!   Corina and Dana – for your collaborative efforts in integrating the Partner Program elements into the ExF experience and for your timely action in helping to lock in details ahead of our internal deadlines. Also, for your leadership and companionship as co-hosts of the Bellyard breakfasts and enthusiasm throughout the onsite experience. Your input during the breakfast conversations added real value to the attendees’ experiences. It was a delight to watch you in action!  With tremendous thanks for your involvement and contribution to this process – congratulations on a job well done! Onward to Dublin!\n\n44#Setting the Stage Like a Pro|To our amazing group of humans who took the stage to announce each WHL breakout speaker - BRAVO!!! This role required poise, prep, guts (especially for anyone not used to big audience public speaking), and energy - engaging the audience and setting the stage for the speaker talent. No small feat! Amy kicked us off by introducing Priya Parker on Monday afternoon and when her heel stuck in the stage floor, she handled it like the pro that she is and showed us all \"how it's done\" with grace and humanity. Everyone truly stepped up (yes, pun intended) for last-minute fill-ins when needed, seizing new opportunities and rising to the occasion. Thank you all for your collaboration and flexibility, and for truly making the breakout experience so phenomenal!\n\n45#WHL Strategic Accounts Team Success|HOTLANTA! Well done to this team of fabulous people! We got to reunite with old friends, new friends, and each other! You worked tirelessly to get the right customers to attend and really engage with us and it really paid off. I was so proud watching you all connect with our customers and see how proud they were to be hosted by you! Each of the customer speaking sessions was FAB! Mike Malloy could hardly contain himself—he may want a fulltime gig! Even GE was beaming! So many customers from so many accounts—many first timers! You all worked your tails off to be sure every customer felt great about their experience and managed to unearth some new insights and opportunities! Well done to each of you and to this fantastic team. You show up for each other and for customers in the very best way…every time. Cheers!!\n\n46#Helping AZ with Charitable Giving|A huge thank you for jumping into action so quickly this week to support AstraZeneca's employees in their efforts to donate to the Ukraine Crisis. Since 28th Feb, they have donated a whopping £120,000 which AZ will match and subsequently double for the British Red Cross. Maria, Natasha, Richard and Sean - thanks for helping get us the daily data to celebrate and communicate the successes of their campaign. Sarah, thanks for designing a custom panel for their home page to simplify this process for employees. Paul & Joyce - thanks for you continued support to really amplify everything this customer does!\n\n47#Q1 QBRs: a Fresh New Year!|A 2 week-er! As we 'wrap up' QBRs for the first quarter of 2022, I want to thank you for your deep discovery work and preparation. We started with a week long deep dive account by account to get us all level set on our current footing. It was a very intense week and I so appreciate you all being so prepared and professional! We then gathered in my city by the Bay for another few days of collaboration, ideation, and BIG idea sharing. What a fantastic few days! Thank you for your commitment to this process, for showing up with your whole selves, for being supportive and encouraging of each other, and for making me laugh so much. I'm so proud of the work we're doing together and always SO happy to see you all in person. (I'm also super grateful that Erika's house is Covid-free! We missed your presence physically but we felt your presence virtually!) Safe travels home and happy weekend! #bestteamevah\n\n48#The BEST team on the Planet!|You all are a team of fierce, focused and determined humans!  I am so thankful to have a front row seat to watch you pouring your heart into all that you do to support our customers and grow the business for Workhuman.  Each of you inspires me beyond measure.  The work you all do everyday is challenging and hard and you make it look effortless.  You are truly moving mountains and I couldn't be more proud of you all. Thank you for being uniquely you!\n\n49#A Major Breakthrough at Nokia|Ro and Paul~ SUPER excited to hear about your breakthrough meeting at Nokia today! It's been Y-E-A-R-S in the making. Paul, networking your way through the web that is a global, sprawling organization and confirming that it's an uphill battle even internally to talk about people over things, takes incredible patience and persistence and some wild hairs. To end up with a meeting with TWELVE HR Leaders including the Global VP of Culture and Leadership, VP of People, VP of Employee Value Proposition, AND the Global Head of Strategic Communications is absolutely remarkable! SO much opportunity and you were ready with the receipts! Ro, you remain a fantastic partner for us, at the ready with incredible Conversations content, compelling impactful story telling, and a TON of energy. Thank you for your partnership! Congrats to you both for this BIG event and continue to root for this momentum to get us to the next level with Nokia!\n\n50#Schneider teamwork|I wanted to express my gratitude to this team for the amazing collaboration in driving us to an on-time delivery for Schneider Electric.  This was a challenging project, but everywhere we turned, we encountered an attitude of 'what can I do to help'. Workhuman is an amazing company, and the  can-do attitude - this was in evidence from each of you through the Schneider work. Thank you all so much for your partnership.\n\n51#And, we're off!|This team had one heck of a year and they're already out of the starting gate to take on 2022! We're 14 days in and I am so inspired by the determination and planning that has lead to a LOT of strategic meetings already. We've already closed 2 more huge customers on the Inclusion Advisor, have Gratitude Summits underway---and a backlog of demand!, and have identified major opportunities with steps toward closing them. Congratulations on a great start to a fresh new year. Please hydrate!\n\n52#Celebrating One Million Moments at AZ|Thank you all for taking the time to record a video and help us celebrate one million recognition moments with AstraZeneca. I'm not sure where the last 2 years have gone but it's an honor to work with a customer at the forefront of this pandemic and I really appreciate everyone's help to share our gratitude and celebrate this milestone. Extra shout out to Allie for bringing it all together and Joyce for wordsmith mastery. Video here: https://weworkhuman.wistia.com/medias/09a804yioq\n\n53#Rebill Resolution!|Thank you all so much for your help and input along the way with rebilling open AZ China invoices to the UK. This will clear a massive backlog of 123 items on their 6 Chinese accounts. It took many calls and would not have happened without each of you. Thanks again and Enjoy!\n\n54#Bring on 2022!|What a group of inspirational and determined people all of you are!  In our time together this week at our QBRs, we focused on our vision and commitment to success in 2022.  I was blown away by the commitment and passion each of you demonstrated to continue to drive for the very best experience for our customers.  That in turn means, we will be driving for the very best for Workhuman.  2021 has been a challenging year in so many ways, both personally and professionally for each of you and the grit and fortitude you all demonstrate on a daily basis is unparalleled.  You all have blown your Moonshots out of the water and have continued to drive this business forward against many challenges.  The integrity and spirit of delivering the best experience for our customers, their culture and their employees is what continues to drive our success here as we continue to see more recognition happening at our largest customers.  You all are the lifeblood and I’m so proud to work alongside each of you.  Cheers!\n\n55#Thankful for You|This is the time of year where everyone is rushing toward the 'finish line'--literally pushing themselves and each other toward another year of record breaking performance. It's the crush of renewal season, always a bit stressful and uncertain until the deals are done. Thank you for hanging in there for each other and acting with integrity and professionalism. I'm so thankful to work with each of you! Wishing you a beautiful long weekend with your family and friends. On to December! Gobble Gobble!\n\n56#Celebrating your perseverance with Teva|Paul, Teva continue to challenge us and keep us on our toes but I wanted to take a moment to recognise your strategic vision and perseverance to gradually build trust with this customer and secure contract extension. It's a pleasure to partner with you on this marathon! Looking forward to the next 6 months and taking this forward.\n\n57#Rocking the RFP Pitch at Schneider Electric|A huge thank you to this incredible team for creating and delivering an intentional Workhuman experience on the SE RFP finalist pitch meeting to cement another 5 years!  For many in the states this meant a very early morning and like SE’s mission of “the moment you’re up – so are we.” It was evident today, everyone on this team lives, breathes and is fully committed to supporting SE and aligning social recognition directly with SE’s people, culture and business goals! Our pillar of Relationships stood tall. You all are writing the book on 5 steps to build long-lasting customer relationships, 1. Communicate what’s possible, what’s available today, how does this tie back to your talent and business goals. 2. Tell the truth – Chris C, amazing job in setting and managing expectations around the product and capabilities. Demonstrating call after call, we hear you, we’re committed and driving towards deadlines. 3. Make Their Lives Better – bring subject matter expertise, guiding them on their journey, what’s in it for SE employees, sharing industry best practices, and making SE’s program team’s day jobs easy. 4. Allow them to experience the Workhuman brand – the agenda, back to the future video, customized demo site, and making each “moment that matters” resonate. 5. Make them feel special – Our words, actions, high level of engagement, and warmth in dialogue all points to you are special Workhuman family members. Paul, Chris C and Traci, thanks for your imagination+ determination = innovation spirit and grit, carrying the key messages, wrapping concepts with illustrations and demonstrating our brand. Steve and Jose, for all your support over the years and today. Rebecca, Melissa F, Brian M, Dan F, Geoff, Alan, Brian K and Jesse A – for setting up the demo website, making it personal, relevant and resonate and the final presentation, a masterpiece!\n\n58#Taking Charge at Takeda|Paul, Tim shared with me what an incredible job you did on your first Steering Committee meeting with Takeda.  This was the first time you were meeting this group of Executives and per usual, they were ready to go down a tactical discussion around the new reporting tool that they had built internally.  You took one look at the situation and made it into a Strategic Discussion.  As they started to show the new reporting tool they had built to give insight into their recognition program, you began to ask questions that would highlight where you wanted them to focus.  You took them down several paths to highlight where there were opportunities to impact their employees experience and how to dive greater impact through the program.  It was a masterful way to flip the situation for the better and strategically get them thinking about all of the right things to increase recognition across the organization.  Incredible instincts and masterful moves Paul!\n\n59#Stepping Up to Celebrate a HUGE ACHIEVEMENT!!!|Party People!! Grab your noise makers, party horns and sing along to “these are the times to remember … the times to hold on to” in honor of SE’s Step-Up program’s 5- year anniversary!  That’s right, back in 2016, when Hamilton became a broadway sensation and Pokemon Go took over social media, the WH team was heads down, launching Step-Up to 160,000+ employees in 113 countries! In 5 short years, SE’s culture is rich in recognition with over 2,000,000 moments translating into recognition happening every minute of the day. Phenomenal!!  As SE celebrates throughout this week, I’d like to celebrate each of you that made this happen. Paul and Steve, you have built extraordinary relationships with executives, the program team, expanded the WH Cloud footprint within SE, turned these early critics into champions and advocates for the WH movement, shepherded SE become an early WH Certified customer, arranged many “first” type meetings, and year after year worked tirelessly to ensure investment in the Step-Up program skyrocketed from $8M to $23M in this time. Celebrating milestones like this reminds us to give thanks for everyday moments that make these results possible.   Jose, Michelle L, Robert, Dan, Lauren S, Melissa F and Kelsey – it’s a true team effort to execute on a week’s long 5-year celebration and refreshed retirement awards program all at once. From prepping and processing files for Charise Le’s (CHRO) award to all employees on Oct 18th to, to using new methods, to applying a new home page graphic, to the Intro Panels to mark the occasion, to the recorded Retirement manager and employee short training videos in English and French, and all of the thousands of actions in between, a huge THANK YOU, THANK YOU!! I’ve grateful to get to work along side such passionate, dedicated, high standards, work through “opportunities” and delight customers colleagues! YOU ROCK!\n\n60#It’s ELECTRIC (boogie-woogie-woogie)|My 7-year-old self often wondered why I was made to do the Electric Boogie (a.k.a. “the electric slide”) in first grade gym class. Why were they making me do this? Who is singing this song? Why are we dancing in a line? When will this knowledge ever be useful to me? Well now i have the answer to at least some of those questions… A huge thank you to everyone who participated in putting together the Schneider Electric renewal proposal – it was a lot of hard work, but the results were electr— (well, you get the idea!)\n\n61#Thanks for the Syngenta ref!|Jose, Paul & Steve, thank you individually and collectively for ensuring Sandra was available to speak with the Baloise Exec team.  I know it took quite a bit of effort on all your parts and for this Emily and I are very grateful indeed.  FYI, still waiting on feedback from Marc re her call on Friday morning, but in the meantime, thanks again for making it happen!  Cheers, Kieran\n\n62#Bursting with Gratitude!|To this magnificent group of remarkable leaders, I wanted to share with you the gratitude I feel for all of you every single day.  Each of you brings a unique point of view and inspiring ways you’re leading our customers into the future.  I can’t imagine this journey without any of you.  My heart is overflowing with gratitude that I get the opportunity to work alongside you, learn from you, laugh with you, swear with you and be inspired by you.  Never have I ever worked with a more talented group of humans.  Thank you for being you!!!\n\n63#Gratitude for your FIRE!|To this incredible team of pros, I hope you are dancing alongside me (virtually) to our theme song! You are the Fire in the band! How lucky are we all to work together and make work for millions of people centered in gratitude?! I'm grateful for each of you every day and inspired by your passion, drive, and leadership. Dance a little, sing a little, and feel celebrated---Never was a cloudy day!\n\n64#Strong partnership with Syngenta|Steve, Paul & Lynette thank you for the great work you are doing with Syngenta.  We had our QBR yesterday and it's great to hear the conversations we have with them, you've elevated these discussions so that we're planning for the future, asking for advise on approaches, discussing company impacting decisions & the role Val-You can play and are established as their trusted partner.  The operational discussions occur on the regular cadence of calls and this is testament to the great work you've done and the appetite to achieve more with Val-You.  Steve thank you the great partnership you've built with Mayur & Sandra, they know you will resolve any queries, give advice on scenarios and are available to brainstorm ideas.  Paul you've established strong relationships with Syngenta, are ensuring the strategic conversations are happening and recognition has a strong role to play within everything they are doing. Lynette thank you for the great partnership since launch, you understand how they communicate, the audiences and give guidance on communications, strategy, operational decisions and play an important role in this account. Thank you all for the fantastic work with this great customer, there's some exciting times ahead and you're the right group to lead, advise and support them in this journey.\n\n65#Transforming the Future|This team is beyond INCREDIBLE and the TRUE DREAM TEAM!  As I think about the future of where Workhuman is going and the experiences we are working diligently to create in partnership with our customers, knowing all of you are leading the way makes me beyond proud.  We spent an incredible couple of days together leveraging our 'Empire State of Strategic Minds\" and worked with determination and passion to identify, align and set a path forward for what is next, how to get there, and take us well beyond a $1B company during our QBR session.  The level of strategic thinking, passion and determination you all demonstrated was truly inspiring.  The transformative strategy you all have outlined is what is going to move us forward in all the best ways with focus on our customers digital transformation, sustainability, agility, inclusion and equity efforts and beyond.  I can’t wait to see where the vision takes this team and the relationships you have built. Amazing work team!\n\n66#Unstoppable Partnership - 5 Years and Counting!|It's ELECTRIC and it's STOPPABLE!! This team has built an extraordinary, unstoppable partnership with one of our largest, strategic, innovative and passionate customers, SE!  Paul, your ability to build strong partnerships at the senior level, inspire others to think differently, think bigger and bolder, sustain momentum and the belief partnering with Workhuman means things will only continue to move from good to great, and rise to new heights is award winning! Your partnership with Lipika, VP of Rewards, has yielded another speaking opportunity for SE at Gartner's Reimagine EMEA event. This partnership and helping the team see the future and reach for it has results that should be in MBA business books. Creating a culture of recognition will (1) decrease SE's $1B in regrettable turnover (2) increase employee engagement, (3) increase high performance (4) increase stock price from $80 in 2019 to $152 in 2021 (5) increase productivity and competitive advantage - check, check, check, check and CHECK!!   Steve, all of the things above are achieved by your daily commitment to SE's success. Unstoppable partnerships don't happen overnight. The key attributes are ones you live every day (1) supportive - dedicated, responsive, committed to excellence, and making customers successful (2) rewarding - win win scenarios for all team members, elevating others, bringing out their best, and feeling like they are a part of a career highlight (3) Trust - building trust in every moment, every interaction, every meeting to be the Senior CSM of the year! Jose, you've been on this journey since day 1 and your expertise, guidance, new and fresh perspective, drive for excellence and support have been paramount over the last 5 years! Melissa, your ability to visually showcase an experience and plan that's emotional and moving is amazing!! The 5 YOS plan received a yes, yes, yes, yes and yes!!! Brittany, thank you for joining us super early to listen and learn! This unstoppable team ROCKS!!!\n\n67#What slowdown?|Team fab. Every week I read your Strategic Insights and am blown away. It's actually a challenge to summarize the incredible work you are doing. Week after week, you are outdoing yourselves. The work that is happening today is work that we were only dreaming about a few years ago! You are truly setting a new bar weekly for us and forcing us to think bigger and bigger as an organization. Thank you for the work you are doing daily, conversation to conversation, meeting to meeting, internally and externally to make incredible things happen. And it's not just the work with customers, the collaboration and teamwork that you demonstrate every day makes me super proud. Thank you and Bravo!\n\n68#Integrating me to the SCD Team!|One month in and I have had such productive one on one conversations with each of the broader SCD team including also Traci and Becky.  Thank you to everyone for being such a productive, positive and meaningful addition to my onboarding.  There is so much to learn from all of  you and I am so thrilled to be a part of this team.  Thanks for leaning in and helping me get up to speed!\n\n69#Sowing the seeds for greater things to come...|Great work everyone today with Syngenta’s latest QBR! Thanks, Paul, for pulling together the key players from both sides, having Ruben, Syngenta’s Global Group Head Diversity and Inclusion attend the meeting and allow him to explain what he and the Syngenta team are working on from D&I was a real eye opener, I think we were all amazed at the amount of work he has done in just 7 months since he has taken on this new role. Well done Meisha-Ann Martin for connecting to dots and providing tangible examples of how D&I and recognition moments can work via our WHIQ Team capabilities… You could see the beaming smiles from Ruben and the Syngenta team at what opportunities lie ahead for us in this area when you took them through your presentation.  Then we chatted about Team Awards and the various new opportunities that lie there too from other parts of the Syngenta business!!! Finally thank you Lynette and Jose for playing your parts too and adding your valid points of view on the topics discussed. The future is bright with Syngenta!! Well done everyone!!\n\n70#Inspiring ICON|Isha, Jose and Paul, thank you all so much for your work over the last few weeks on the ICON Exec summary deck. As this client is currently undergoing one of the biggest acquisitions in their company history, we haven't been able to get in front of the program team for a review meeting. Because of this, we needed to be proactive and provide them with a brief and clear overview of the program data, that we could just hand over to them. As our program team are really close to the Inspire data, we also needed to make sure the data made sense and that we were sharing new and interesting insights on Inspire that they haven't seen before. This took a couple of meetings and iterations, but we got there. What we have to deliver to ICON is a clear, digestible and insightful overview of what is happening in Inspire. I'm really looking forward to hearing the feedback from the client on this. Thank you all again for your time and collaboration to pull this together.\n\n71#Making Sparks Fly|Huge THANK YOU to all of you for an incredible Quarterly Business Meeting today!  We could have spent the entire 3 hours celebrating all of the amazing work you all are doing. You all are the visionaries leading our customers into the Future of Work and helping them to build cultures that celebrate their employees.  The work you’re doing is fundamentally inspiring employees to feel valued, included and recognized for their contributions and unique perspectives.  As we continue to drive towards our goals for the second half of the year, I am certain we will continue to make sparks fly in all the right ways.  Your dedication and passion for the work we do is unprecedented and so evident in all you deliver.  I continue to be blown away by the talent each of you bring and can’t thank you enough for everything you do to support our customers.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n72#1st Annual Review for AstraZeneca|A huge thank you for the teamwork to bring together last weeks 1st Annual Review for AstraZeneca. I am hugely aware of the time and dedication to align the data insight to the story and I want to thank each one of you for your engagement in the many prep calls to help to make this a success. Alan, thanks for sharing your expertise and experience, working through the iterations and follow ups with the customer in record speed. Meisha-Ann, I am so grateful for your support, sharing insight, best practices and your personal experiences to optimise these meetings. Joyce, never more than a slack message away, you provide impact and moments of delight to the customer daily.  Paul, thank you for your insights, professionalism and vision to ensure this customer gets the attention it deserves as we work towards executive ready presentations. A great first year and I have no doubt this partnership will continue to go from strength to strength under your direction. Thank you all!\n\n73#Stepping Up Workhuman Live Online|Paul & Traci – I love the above quote from the CHRO at Schneider Electric, Charise Le. The both of you “took initiative, kept challenging the status quo and stayed curious” to secure her as speaker of our upcoming WHLO event. Traci, you reached out to Utkarsh Mittal to initially ask for his help in securing an interview with Olivier Blum, former CHRO and now Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer. They loved the idea, but came back to us with how about Charise Le, the new CHRO. The two of you kicked in your sense of urgency and went right to work, working with internal teams to make this a reality and coordinated across time zones to create the best scenario possible for Charise. To make this as easy as possible for our internal teams and Charise, you drafted up the questions for the interview session to bring out the best in the SE story, their journey and provide the audience with inspiration and actionable takeaways! Who doesn’t want to hear about the Next Era of the Human Workplace and how to get there! These asks and these gets require great trust and partnership, which the two of you have built so impeccably at Schneider Electric. This is sure to be in incredible interview and one the WH community will find tremendously valuable! Absolutely INCREDIBLE initiative and determination. Way to go!\n\n74#What's Next in Employee Experience for Schneider?|What's next for the employee experience at Schneider was what we called our ' 2021 Priorities Strategy Meeting' with our Schneider friends!! Traci, from the very first slide we were ALL hooked at how we can help them on their continuous journey with Workhuman. Showing them the full Workhuman experience for each of their employees and how that experience could look like if they added Life Events & Community Celebrations to their current Workhuman experience. You presented lots of facts and figures against your customer stories on where we can leverage all that's good with their Step Up Program to support areas that we can improve on. On top of us reviewing team awards on what they have done and what are the next steps to promote this option even more within their company to showcasing our new Inclusion Advisor which was as expected received with great excitement!!! Well done!! Paul, thanks as well for ensuring we were not the only ones talking in our jam packed session. Your questions back to Lipika and the Team were really valued and it made sure we had them really thinking about the bigger picture so we have another successful year with them! Well done to you both for making 60mins so worthwhile for the customer!!\n\n75#Always Ready!|Congrats and well done to this powerhouse team of Strategic Leaders on a blowout Q1! Your hard work and always ready mentality has proven to be our secret weapon. Every week I see you making major chess moves with our Strategic Accounts and teeing us up to win big. So many congratulations on the first of many successful quarters in 2021. Super proud of each of you and your new fabulous leader! Rock on!\n\n76#WOW, WHAT A LIGHTNING brain STORM|Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for your participation in our SFDC Lightning migration prep sessions!  Your input will be crucial to the success of this transition.  Change can be tough but with partners like you, I'm incredibly excited for what's to come!\n\n77#A New Voice....|Great work Paul on your first strategy call with Avanade. You gave a great introduction to the customer on your past work experiences and also what your are doing with other customers at Workhuman. I could see they were in good hands from the first minute of the meeting and it was nice to bounce off each other ideas of how we manage their ambition of how to connect more with their employees... As you said  in the meeting, 'you are now in the thick of it' and its great to have you on board. Welcome to Go Team!\n\n78#A Team Appreciation Day!|Happiest Employee Appreciation Day to this team of badasses! I could not be prouder to work with such a team of professionals. You make work fun! You show up every day, leaning in, supporting each other, raising the bar, and celebrating every moment along the way. I hope you feel the love every day but especially today! Thank you for being such great caretakers of our mission and leaders for the organization. Strategic Client Directors lead the way!\n\n79#Making Human Connections Stronger|And we are OFF 😊… Yes, our first QBR for 2021 with our Schneider-Electric friends. That’s right, they have become family and this meeting was full of that human CONNECTION. From Traci and Yuri introducing themselves to the new Schneider team members and telling how we work and play (kudos to you both for sharing wine tasting and marathon running tips!!) to Lipika, Meenaxi and Deepak sharing some of their wonderful family moments over the last few months with us. This is how we start meetings, breaking down barriers and allowing people to be themselves and it showed, Lipika gave a comprehensive overview of the business, in what was overall a very successful year for them, in fact if I quote Lipika it has been a ‘signature year’ for them , from having all their factories, offices and of course their customers able work around the global COVID19 pandemic ( example was having them make ventilators for medical use!!), their share prices have literally 'skyrocketed' to them celebrating as being voted by Corporate Knights World Economic Forum as best global sustainable company in 2021!! These meetings of course are only successful when you have great humans at the helm that can engage with everyone both on a personal and business level. First up was Yuri who took all of us on the WH Certified journey, then we had Traci who mastered the juggling act of talking about what WH saw from customers in 2020 with turnover & customer experience trends to showing key things to think about in a global comms plan to showing results of their CEO Team award… Then we had our Product update allowing Jim and John take a deep dive into Teams integrations. Thanks also to Paul for adding in your contributions to the dialogue and making sure we think big for our future with this exciting customer and lastly Jose for joining our meeting since she came back earlier this month...Thanks to everyone here for taking the time to do this important QBR.\n\n80#Visibility 2021|It's February 18! We're almost halfway through the quarter! What a whirlwind 2021 has been. Thanks to this team of inspired minds for coming together this week to review detailed individual action plans for our strategic accounts and also coming together to share our biggest opportunities with each other. We all learn and grow so much together and I LOVE IT! Special shout out to our new BFF, Yuri! Thanks so much for kicking us off, inspiring our thinking, introducing us to the best new yogi 2021, and giving us some insight and vision for the future of WHCE. We're so lucky to have you! Thanks to everyone on the team for contributing to our Periscope project and Data Insights project. We've made some real progress on ass kicking and it's 'only' February! I see you!\n\n81#'Cause That's What Dreams Are Made Of!|Sing with me, sing me with me!!! Cue the Van Halen song ... Dreams! Oh baby, we belong ... in a world that must be strong ... oh, that's what dreams are made of ... And in the end ... on dreams we will depend... 'cause that's what Workhuman humans are made of!   A huge THANK YOU team for living our value of Respect for Quality and helping Workhuman/Schneider Electric program team realize a long awaited DREAM!! Today, Jean Pascal (CEO) sent a Thank You award to all 130,000 employees in 115 countries to sincerely thank everyone for the tremendous efforts in 2020. None of this would have been possible without this team!   Steve and Paul, finally the dream of Schneider's CEO leveraging the Step Up platform to recognize and communicate with all employees across the globe! The countless account reviews, ad hoc meetings, polite pestering, strategy sessions etc. to get this to happen have been endless. But in the end, we knew we'd prevail because we dream big!! To the amazing technical and support team members who worked on this for the last 5-7 days ensuring a flawless execution, thank you!! It was your attention to detail, dedication, actively seeking inputs from other teams/sources to make timely and well-informed decisions, loading, testing and your commitment to quality that was on full display today across the globe!  The SVP of Total Rewards sent this comment - Thank you all for your support for this master piece of work! My Thank You award from the boss is in my mail box as I start my day. Best Karine. Followed by - Absolutely Karine! It was so nice to receive this message as the first message of the day! Start to a wonderful Wednesday. Thanks Utkarsh for managing it well internally. Thanks a lot Steve, Paul and Traci for organizing it as per plan. Thanks team! Lipika.   Thank you recognition rock stars!!\n\n82#Dr. Dre is the soundtrack for Saved by the Bell?|It sure can be when you get to decide who would play you in the story of your life! ... All - Thank you for a wonderful \"Zoom-around\". You demonstrated great creativity and shared a dose of good insight when asked the question, \"Who would play you in the story of your life?\" I enjoyed getting to know each of you a bit more, and appreciate this aspect of Ignite (in person or virtual) most - getting to meet and learn more about my fellow humans. With gratitude, -C\n\n83#Ready for a New Year!|Thanks to this very focused team of experts and leaders for creating something out of the tough 'hand' 2020 dealt us. Through all we've maneuvered through, I've consistently heard nothing but determination, strength, support for each other and for others, and a fierceness to overcome that is burned in my memory forever. As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking. Spending as much time as possible making things happen leaves little time for planning so all the more impressive how thoroughly you prepared to review action plans for each of your accounts. Thanks to our badass team of magicians, Traci and Rebecca for helping me pull off one of our greatest QBRs to date. Cheers to you all and to many more years of success together! You are all the magic of Christmas!\n\n84#Its been a rollercoaster of a year|Paul great job on your support for our last QBR for Schneider in 2020. It was great to meet the new program owner Vipika and listen to her ideas of what she would  like to work on with us in 2021. Kudos to you for making sure we pulled as much intel from her in those opening minutes of the meeting. Well done in helping us deliver another great meeting with one of our most interesting customers! Enjoy!\n\n85#The Road to More SUCCESS is NOW|Paul and Lynette thanks for joining me on a very successful partnership meeting with Syngenta the other week. This meeting was in planning stage for so long I thought it was never going to happen, in fact I believe we were supposed to have met Sandra, Mayur and the team back in Spring in Switzerland, but then 2020 has been a different year hasn’t it!!! Anyhow that did not stop the charge forward. Paul well done in keeping Sandra focused and having all of us take a step back to help her learn the basics of Workhuman and what we do for them with Val-You. By creating a simple framework for our meeting, we were able to showcase Syngenta’s journey with us so far and help Sandra catchup on all that's happened in the past and allow this fairly new team to see things more clearly, essentially pull them out from the weeds!! Once we had this addressed, then it got exciting where we spoke of how to make their plans to expand into China next year a reality,, this then led to more strategic conversations around integrations and looking to partner them with our WHIQ Team. Lynette, thanks for pulling together ideas of how we can help them launch China expansion with a bang and reassure them that the hard work is already done, Val-You is already touching the lives of thousands of Syngenta’s employees !!!.  Things are really starting to happen for this customer and with December being their program’s strongest month of rewards activity since launch this bodes well for a great 2021.  Great work team!!\n\n86#Grateful for the 'A' Team|Sending a heartfelt moment of thanks to this team of fierce friends. 2020 has been a test in many ways. The one thing that it has cemented for me is that the bonds that we make over time are clearly revealed in times of struggle. Thank you for your unwavering support of each other and the business through these many, many months of stress and hard work. Wishing each of you a day of rest and some time to reflect on your achievements thus far. I continue to be inspired by you and by the possibilities you see in yourselves and each other!\n\n87#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n88#Stepping UP when times got tough|It's all happening! After a global pandemic all but ground our friends at Schneider to a halt, this fearsome 3 doubled down on their Inspire At All Cost mentality and got to work setting a strategy that would create the greatest FOMO a company has ever felt! You set your sights high and aimed for the EHRLT---introducing their new CHRO, Charise to WH and confirming that she's already a raving fan. You recruited their CDO Tina Mylon to represent SE on the world stage and one of the first WH pre-certified companies confirming that she and their CEO were absolutely proud to be in line with the tenants set forth. But at the end of the day, what has mattered the MOST is your continuous support of their culture, your partnership to their leadership team, and your recruitment efforts over many years to cut the path for a recognition culture at SE--recruiting employees to overwhelming participate and support this culture. It's all the big meetings AND the every day actions and one to ones both internally and externally that get us through the hardest of times and the best of times. The news today, in writing, that SE is anxious to turn back on value at their 2019 levels is a tribute to all of the hard work that the 3 of your have put in over the long course of 9 months . Congratulations and thank you for being an incredible team and for representing the best of WH. Bravo!\n\n89#Pioneering efforts|Eileen, Marie, Paul and Patrick, thank you for your outstanding efforts in securing the first three Workhuman Certified Pioneers!  Securing executive level sponsorship for a brand new, provocative and industry changing initiative like this is not for the faint-hearted.  It requires creativity, persistence and courage to paint a vision for these leaders of what could be.  And you all came through!  The customer videos from Schneider, Cisco and Baystate were so powerful and a critical validation of our efforts to create a more human workplace.  Your contributions made this launch possible.  Thank you and fantastic work!\n\n90#Doing the dirty work|Let's face it, data clean up is no fun.  But, it's worth it!  Thank you for taking time out of your insane schedules to comb through data, find missing pieces and populate our tracker.  Becasue of your efforts we'll be able to get this into a centralized place - allowing us to work smarter and faster from here on out.  Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and getting it done!\n\n91#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n92#Setting up camp on the Moon|The biggest of shout outs to this group of badass teammates! Talk about taking Moonshots! Each of you came together to influence directly, support, and create an lane for us to present the WHCE movement directly to the most senior executives at some of our most influential customers. While we have certainly had opening in the enterprise communications groups at customers over the years, I believe this opportunity/offer to amplify their employee brand with Workhuman is being met in a very different way in 2020. The reactions at Board level executives is 'absolutely!'. While some of their calendars could not support the October timeframe, I believe they will be clamoring to participate in on-going events. We're going to have to start reading up on Beyond the Moon Shots! We have created incredible relationships with Executive Communications leaders through this process...relationships that will make us unstoppable. Thank you for your collaboration, support, all-in attitudes, and LEADERSHIP! To the Moon and Beyond!\n\n93#Schneider Electric Briefing|Derek, Paul, and Brenda – Many thanks for your support on the Schneider Electric briefing call for Workhuman Certified and Workhuman Live Online. Their SVP of Talent & Diversity came into and left the conversation excited and eager to be a pioneer as a WHCE company and has a wealth of knowledge to share in her interview with Lisa Ling and beyond. Paul, the strength of our partnership with them is clear and I’m very appreciative of all your efforts to help get us to this point including Tina’s participation in the online event.  Derek & Brenda, I learn so much from you on every call regarding Certified and Tina was engaged in everything you put in front of her. The team is well-positioned to continue to move this train forward and have a successful event next month.\n\n94#Thermo and Icon back in business!|Congratulations and thank you for your continued work over these last months to get these two customers to turn their recognition programs back on. I know that's it's been a lively 2020 with many ups and downs. Having a customer suspend a program after so much progress and momentum has been built over years of hard work has been really tough especially on you closest to the customers. Thank you for staying true to the WH Way and for motivating, coaxing, and cheering these two important customers to get back into the recognition business. Their employees are benefiting from your hard work and commitment. Bravo!\n\n95#Stepping into the future, TOGETHER!!!|To this amazing SE team - One step started this journey. One word \"thank you\" transformed SE's culture. One pandemic \"paused\" our progress. One \"team spirit\" has us forward focused. One team who bleeds Customer Success makes us a DREAM TEAM! Today was no exception to how we show up for SE with unwavering support, constant care, and total partnership - no matter the situation. Why? Because we know the road to success has many twists. Sally's words \"Thank you for the partnership. There have been NO GAPS in support even with our current situation. It's impressive.\" What a powerful, true statement!  Paul, you've probably felt the most turns in this journey. From meeting SE's CHRO your 3rd week, to stepping in to lead, to building strong relationships, to providing the perfect blend of guidance and gentle nudges, to bringing value to every engagement, to taking the tough calls, navigating all the changes - it's truly impressive. And personally, I love how Sally perks up and hangs on your every word. You're not afraid to speak up, nudge Sally on reinstating points, what's needed, and hold her accountable for actions in your effective Paul way.   Steve, you've become such a trusted partner for the team. You've mastered how SE likes to run Account Reviews. You continue to highlight the good Schneider is doing during these difficult times, champion where to next, close out every open action item, continue to push for integrations and set the program up for success once again in 2021. I know Utkarsh, Deepak and Marie would be lost without you - and me too!   Alan, you've become SE's resident data expert! They always look forward to hearing from you and understanding the story behind the data. You've done a marvelous job of sharing the data in a way that's easy to consume, tells the story and points to well, points matter!  Gil, you've been our steady support on SE Account review calls. It's very appreciated! You ALL ROCK!!\n\n96#Building Momentum|Thanks to this team for your time today discussing certified customer stories for Workhuman Live Online. Sometimes it takes an hour or two of good old-fashioned brainstorming to assess where we’re at in the process, identify the key leaders we want involved, and talk through any potential challenges. A special shout out to Eileen, Marie, and Paul for providing additional insight into each of your respective certified customers. Your expertise on collaborating with these accounts is priceless. While it will take a small village to get this over the finish line, there’s no better group of humans positioned to do it. Thanks to everyone for taking on the challenge so we can create something really exceptional alongside our customers.\n\n97#The Two Day ZoomBR Bonfire!|Thanks to this amazing team for two days (well, half days) of inspired thinking and planning in preparation for an amazing 2nd Half! As much as we missed the personal interaction and late nights, we managed to reconnect in a way that we really haven't been able to pull off in a few months! Special shout out to our Queen, Traci Pesch! She really knows how to inspire, engage, and fan the flames of success! Between Traci and Rebecca's creative minds we've got a great plan to find s'more ways to connect and create incredible experiences for our customers! And, looky here, we've got ourselves a marketing team! Thanks ever so much to the gods who sent us our fierce team in customer marketing, represented with the incredible Kristen G! A thoughtful, workable plan to bring our friends into the many cool streams happening in marketing. And lastly, thanks to all of you badass SCDs, always bringing the big ideas, shaking things up, pushing beyond your comfort zones and helping our customers do the same! I'm humbled and impressed every day to get to work with such a powerful group of people who do nothing but cheer each other on! Let's go light this thing up!\n\n98#Wow|Team, I was reviewing all of your progress updates for top accounts early this morning and I have to say that the work this team is doing is fantastic.  So many different variables are involved in these huge, complex accounts but each of you is on top of your accounts in such a strategic way.  Whether it is new growth in thriving accounts like bulk uploads, new sales incentive programs and retirement/milestone awards or just the right amount of surrounding for those accounts in temporary suspension.  This \"in the trenches\" work is so critical to the health and growth of both our business and the lives of the employees at your customers.  They need it more than ever right now.  Bravo and well done!  And special call out to your fearless leader Eileen who is leading from the front with a huge dose of imagination and determination.  Happy Monday!\n\n99#Syngenta makes Life Events a Reality!|Another amazing story to tell. How things have really changed over the last few years for Syngenta. We really  are starting to see this customer think more strategically about Val-You, how it impacts their employees and even with the current situation the world is seeing they are embracing new things to bring to their employees. Today we launched to their 35,000 employees Life Events and both Mayur and Sandra wrote back to me to say 'how wonderful the new program is' and that they really look forward to seeing how their employees embrace this new feature to the Val-You experience. Paul thanks you for making the contract updates seamless and getting this over the line quickly and Lynette thanks for helping me execute a quick turnaround in getting this launched in super quick time with your communications for the program. Finally, thanks Clarice for configuring and validating all the features worked 100% for the customer before they launched it. Great work everyone!\n\n100#Creating Exceptional Relationships That Matter!|Thank you all for creating exceptional customer relationships that matter! Like peanut butter and jelly, fine wine and cheese - Workhuman and Schneider go together. A journey started 4 years ago with like- minded companies collaborating together to make work more human. Q1 started with enormous momentum - a bang! Step Up recognition was surging 43% recipient reach, 16% nom reach. From 2018 to 2019, a 30% increase in investment totaling $13.5M in 2019 spend. Then the pandemic hit SE hard and the pan-DARN IT happened with SE needing to temporary suppress points-based awards. Tough times bring out the best and worst in humans. And the humans at WH only bring their best selves! Paul, you continue to show SE executives our unwavering support and partnership, bring innovative ideas and solutions to the table, provide loads of confidence and trust in 'we're here for you' and  confirmed points awards will be turned on by the beginning of 2021. You have a lovely way of keeping the program team focused on experiences and outcomes and out of the weeds. Steve, my SE work husband, who's consistently reminding us all of what it means to be a true partner, listen to needs, be absolutely responsive in crazy times, slay the numerous emails from Utkarsh and Deepak and essentially keep us all cycling together on the Tour de Schneider. Fantastic job! Alan, the data analysis shared today around the impact of suppressing points was both stomach wrenching and insightful. It clearly points to SE needs to reinvest in Step Up first!! Erin and John, thank you for providing integration and product updates. Your areas of expertise always have SE leaning in and listening. Luke and Joyce, the final polished up communication pieces for Retirement Awards couldn't have happened without your help! Guil, appreciate the time you carved out to listen, learn and provide feedback. Fresh set of eyes and ears. Thank you all for creating relationships, experiences and moments that matter! You Rock!!!\n\n101#Dream Team|I just want to take this moment to pay homage to this team of fierce, talented leaders for their focus and resilience during what is sure to go down in history as one of the most stressful times in world history. It's been quite an experience for each of us during this pandemic both from the work perspective and the 'outside of work' perspective. Each of you has been laser focused on the opportunity this situation created for our business and each of you have created opportunities out of this situation for the business! I'm so humbled by the never-quit mentality that you have lead with and continue to lead with in this environment. The impact you have made on our business at this moment is astounding. Thank you for the sacrifices, determination, support for each other, humor, and grace you have shown these past few months. It's pure joy to work with you!\n\n102#Delivering a New Experience in a New Climate|Great work is a result of great teamwork! This was a mammoth task to undertake even under normal times but to execute this in the current climate just shows the professionalism and determination each one of you has shown. Today we launched via Service Milestone product offering -  Schneider’s Retirement Program. Rachel we would not be able to have this achieved this goal without you leading the charge from the back end with your team keeping Paul and I up to date with what we could support today versus down the road. Your passion to balance the technology versus the overall customer experience was exceptional! Paul you navigated our discussions from a strategic level keeping the program manager and the VP of Reward more focused on the bigger picture and overall what the ideal experience we want for Schneider’s employees and finally Traci having you wield your magic and ensure that how we communicate and promote the new program is done the right way, the icing on the cake was your beautiful yet simple PowerPoint presentation that any Schneider executive will see what our Workhuman cloud solution can deliver and allow the employee to see for the first time how much they meant to the organisation (on a very human level)! Fantastic work yet again from all of you! Enjoy\n\n103#Strategic perspective|Paul, I just wanted to thank you so much for the strategic perspective you've brought to our Schneider Retirement discussions. We have a long history of \"learned behavior\" with them when it comes to product enhancements. You're quite skillfully helping both our organizations pivot to more of a shared value partnership. I can tell you from the Product side, your focus on the bigger picture and keeping calm in the face of temporary challenges has been incredibly helpful and allowed me to focus more on setting the path forward with the team for where we can and should go to the benefit of ALL our customers. So thank you!!\n\n104#Nokia Breakthrough!|Paul--Congrats on having a MAJOR breakthrough at Nokia! I remember being impressed with a story you told during the interview process of having a big breakthrough at a prospect as a sales person and being very impressed. You took NO TIME to put those skills to work at Nokia. Stalking their Global Head of People Analytics to find him speaking at an event(on-line). Listening and learning what he was keyed in on in his role. Doing specific outreach to him that hit on those key themes. And that messaging leading to a quick agreement to speak. Now a great opportunity to create true partnership through our talent in analytics and insights. You even have him going to work internally to find out who should be paying attention to our work! I mean, IMPRESSIVE! Super happy for you! Sometimes these wins lead to our biggest opportunities! Bravo!\n\n105#A Star Turn with SE|I'd like to commend you both for building such an strong bond with each other that even in the transition of SE's account, you have not missed a beat. You've essentially created a virtual seat at the ELT table through your partnership and focus. Because of this, the HR leadership fought to champion and hold on tight to the Step Up program---in an incredibly tough business environment. As the decision was delivered, you both showed great initiative and drive to make room for opportunity. You personally reached out to Karine and Olivier and shared 'we're partners, here for you, what can we do' and created an opportunity for Eric to do outreach to their new incoming CHRO. You took immediate action to ensure the 'best scenario' and focused on the employee experience. You prepared and delivered a detailed plan, outlined the steps WH would take to bolster up leveraging Thank You awards to express recognition and gratitude to others, the communications to support, the offer of the special edition Life Events and Conversations, and importantly add the 'key' comment 'let's continue to monitor and track SE's situation every 2 weeks.' Speaks volumes to how well you conducted all of the conversations leading up to 'the call' and then post call news and immediate action plan. You truly are a model for working human.  Karine, Sally and Utkarsh have huge amounts of respect and admiration for your work---and they were in fact, BLOWN AWAY with the incredible communication strategy presented to the team not 24 hours later. This was no easy feat with this customer! It all boils down to gaining the confidence and trust of others through honesty, integrity, and authenticity! Thank you for stepping and show SE, Workhuman, and all humans what it means to be a true partner - someone to lean on in good times and bad! Your leadership will create a path to even greater success as SE finds their way back to ‘normal’ business activities. SO WELL DONE!\n\n106#Team PaulMartin|Has it really been a year? Who knew that after what seemed like a year's search, we'd actually find TWO new team members last year to start at almost the same time and become BFFs in a matter of months? What an incredible experiment! Each of you has brought new perspective and master level skills to the team and they have certainly being deployed at a rapid pace. SInce the moment you each took over your portfolio of accounts, you dove in with great confidence and got down to business. I'm sure you both feel like 10 year veterans at this point in time! Who knew the universe would throw us such a situation that would accelerate your 'ramp up' period? Thank you for being great sports and for bringing humor, teamwork, and excellence in spades to the team. We all feel so lucky to call you friends and colleagues!\n\n107#CREATING A WAVE of GRATITUDE|Can you feel it? It's a soul lifting, soaking you to the bone, crashing wave of gratitude and joy that is emanating from this group of people. There are SO many ways this team of people is banding together, ideating, taking action, sharing, and LIFTING our customers (and each other) in this incredible hectic time! I just want to take a moment to say thank you for working through this time of uncertainty with your hearts on your sleeve. For reaching out to customers and giving them strength and light and the power to do good. If there was ever a team meant for the right now, it's this team. Thank you from leading from each of your seats and for creating incredible opportunities on a daily basis for our customers, for our brand, and for our business! You're ALL HEART and I'm loving it!!!\n\n108#It takes a BIG Village to pull this together!!|It REALLY does take a village to successfully execute these quarterly business reviews we have with Schneider-Electric.  Every single one of you played a huge part in helping us execute another successful meeting. From Dympna and Brian managing all the catering, IT and car parking aspects to ensure Sally Convey VP was given the warm welcome she deserved, to the actual meeting itself. As with any of these important meetings timing is critical to ensure we don’t lose focus on what we want to address in these strategy sessions. From getting up to date intel from Sally advising they are getting a new CFO and a new CHRO in Q2, (Olivier is staying at Schneider but moving up the ranks and taking up a position as an advisory within their Board of Management) to discussing the share price increase in Q1 for the company, to Alan demonstrating some fantastic WHIQ analysis on how the program’s latest success rates are linked to them removing approvals on certain awards, and that we can see how their management and executive employees are performing within the program, to Erin and John showing our plans to partner with them on various product integrations which again Schneider are leading the charge. Then we had an overall high level review of what comms and strategy tactics (go Traci!!!) to ensure we are ahead of the curve and making sure the Schneider Team promote storytelling, culture and recognition activity at every opportunity including new program ideas such as Retirement awards and not to mention your fantastic quarterly PDF newsletter template that will help tell the WH/Schneider story at a high level for the Schneider management team, to finally Paul showcasing our first customer WH Live website specially designed for Schneider to share and help promote WH Live among their leaders, ambassadors and executives. Phew!! there is a lot of good work being done here!!! Well done to everyone of you and here is to a great start in 2020 for this customer!\n\n109#Full Speed Ahead|#weworkhuman #shootthemoon #theinstitute  What a revitalizing day and a half! Thank you to this team of great big thinkers and risk takers for a deeply challenging few days of daring to reach for BIG ideas and creative paths to accomplish our mission. It was a great way to kick off our “project” for 2020. I believe this team, in this partnership, can achieve new heights. Thank you for giving yourself to this with your whole self! Cheers to the Dream State! Special shouts to Becky, Traci, and Jill for helping nail down our process and making sure we paused to drink and eat!!!\n\n110#Did we just become best friends?!|Team Gallows Dine Around 2020! What a lovely time we had at Ignite. From the cuisine (who doesn't adore poutine?!) to such wonderful conversation. 90's dance music, who would play our documentaries (nice icebreaker, Chris!), to finding hidden Bruins fans and exchanging hilarious movie quotes. What an awesome group. Thanks all so much for such a great night and being so awesome for my first dine around host experience.\n\n111#Making Schneider even better in 2020|Paul, it was great to finally put our partner shoes on and work together on our first face to face meeting of 2020 with our Schneider friends. Any facetime spent with our customers is always rewarding, and to quote Maria’s words on this occasion ‘thanks Paul and Steve for making the trip over to Paris and giving time with her and Utkarsh, it's so good to get time with you both to have great conversations on how we can build on what great things we have already did’. It echoes how far we have come with this customer and that despite their high expectations they do appreciate the energy, time and effort we put into this partnership with them. Yesterday's meeting was no exception we discussed how we want to work more effectively as partners in 2020 breaking out our areas of concern into Digital, Operations & Strategy, agreeing on who owns what from both sides of the partnership so it's not just sitting on one person’s shoulders! It’s also great to see that due to our strong ties with them that we were not afraid to call out items that simply we cannot support or it’s not what we should do and challenge the customer to really think about what is the best decision to achieve their goals. From demonstrating the new Pendo project to following up on further discussions around Outlook, Gloat and Yammer integrations, discussing the current results on the removal of approvals (the brave move Olivier made last year on removing approvals from some of their awards), delving deeper into who can help us increase our footprint within SE world,  to discussing who is coming to WH Live, we covered a lot of ground in our three-hour meeting.  Great job!!! One word of caution, maybe next time we will skip the dinner at Five Guys before a flight!!!\n\n112#Braving the road ahead!|Paul, a huge thanks for all that you are doing with Teva. I know it is challenging but all of your support and work to ensure we are building the right relationships and finding our champions is really helping to set us up for success in the long run. A few hurdles ahead but we have a clear, strategic path in the right direction and I look forward to partnering on this in 2020. Thank You!\n\n113#Q4 QBRs Rocked!|Thanks to every person on this team for bringing your best selves to Cleveland in the middle of a flurry of major projects, meetings, deliverables, and personal commitments. Each of you came together to share some incredible best practices, strategies that have moved the needles with our biggest opportunities, and some big plans for 2020. There is no better group of people to spend 2.5 days with talking about work. You bring a passion to the business that is only matched by Traci's passion for Cleveland! Thank you for your commitment to excellence! You ROCK!\n\n114#Audience with the Queen at Schneider!|Paul, to kick off this recognition moment, it is only apt to showcase your official cover photo on team Pave hah! What a way to kick off your introduction to the “Queen Bee” at Schneider’s HQ in Paris, which by the way is appropriately name “The Hive”! After weeks and weeks of planning, the day finally arrived. I was really impressed by the probing questions you put together which I have dubbed a “Paul original” when briefing Eileen about our work together in prep for the meeting. Slides are not meant to be the end all be all of meetings but rather a guide to help focus attendees and put forth critical thinking content. It was incredibly refreshing to see the new way you’ve introduced to kick off meetings. That one slide alone could be our template on how to create meaningful conversations with executives. It serves to intelligently educate us on the most important things to an organization and arm us with deep understanding of how we can best partner with them. Karine is not an easy one to break through and she was fully engaged and vested. Congratulations on a successful very first meeting on our Schneider tour!\n\n115#Doing it right|Paul, I just wanted to called out that I think your willingness to step forward, share ideas and try to move us beyond our traditional approaches to excellence is making us all better. Today’s feedback session on the Boston exec forum is just the latest example. It takes courage to be the new guy and bring forward ideas that are pushing the envelope. You do so fearlessly, and respectfully, which is a combination that can only lead to success in the future. Thanks for stepping up and I look forward to many many more examples like this in the future.\n\n116#Creating a pathway to success for Tata|We spend a lot of time with our customers, but it’s time we invest well when we get to do meetings like this that showcase how time well spent can show our customers how they value us as partners. Over the last 6 years we have watched the people at Tata Communications watch their Applause program grow stronger year after year and like our most successful customers they are not afraid to ask, where do we go from here, how can we increase the investment and get even more return at the same time, how can we leverage better technology with our employees to achieve those ambitions… and with that we launched our latest strategy review with one purpose, how do we change the conversation to make our customers see their current success versus potential future can be huge? As we listened diligently to Aman and how important Destination 21 is for Tata (to become the best employer by 2021 in each region they work in) to telling us how their successful employee engagement results in certain parts of the business are very much connected to their Applause Program, it was a great opportunity to show some great case study results from Cisco and LinkedIn and how their stories can be so inspirational and how they are making the leap to greater success as well allowing us to take their own programs results through the WHARI lens and show them great insights into their own program results within their organisation. To conclude, I had a follow-up meeting with the program team and they simply said as usual it’s always a pleasure to meet with Workhuman as they are always so inspiring and always pushes us to think differently. Great work Paul, Greg and Jose and whilst we have some work to do, it’s always better to work with a customer that is already on a great journey with us!\n\n117#And, they're off!|PaulMartin, what a joy it is to watch the two of you launch your careers at Workhuman! You've both been incredibly focused since day one, preparing to take on some of our largest, most strategic accounts, with a bang. Well, the race has begun (and I'm afraid, it's never going to end....there will be short breaks!!...but we're always moving forward!) Right out of the gate, you've been thrown right into some of the most complicated work we do and you're handling it all quite beautifully. So happy to have you on this amazing team! Let's do this!!\n\n118#Excellent Insights|This award is just a tad overdue!!  Thanks a mill Paul for the excellent insights you shared ala your SFSF experience at our recent International Sales team meeting - the case study you shared re BMW plus the other nuggets you shared on: ABQ; looking for champions and external partners in a A/C and ultimately not being afraid to walk away were all excellent insights and my team (plus me!) would all agree that they were really useful takeaways from your session.  Thanks again Paul for taking the time to do this and I'm really looking forward to partnering with you to continue to grow our Intl business - Kieran\n\n119#The Percussion Section is on FIRE|Thanks to each of you for bringing your 'best beats' to Bootcamp! Every great band needs a percussion section that can offer confidence, a solid framework, and some sick solos. Each of you came to play in Newport! Thank you for sharing your success with our most significant customers, your confidence in our market leadership, and your learnings along the way. Not only did you share with the broader sales organization but also in our team meetings throughout the week.  It's always tough to get through our QBR session, even when we have twice the time, so this time was especially impactful as you shared your work and opportunities. Especially thankful for our teammates who are bringing the pain with some incredible marketing ideas and experience projects that should elevate our ability to play into our Mick Jagger years! Cheers!\n\n120#The Power of Humans Electrify Schneider Electric!!|Say it with me … Workhuman! Workhuman!!! That’s right unleash the power of HUMANS and record levels of positivity, imagination, inspiration and innovation happen! This week it happened right before our eyes in Dublin with SE's Senior Total Rewards team.   Mirfie, your vision and passion for building authentic, trusted, and super strong partnerships with executives and senior leaders is superb! They see your vision, how WH can support and can’t wait to learn more. 47 new senior gratitude advocates!! Jose, you led from the front when Mirfie had unexpected family emergency. A true partner, working with Sally, our internal teams and executives to execute a flawless, memorable highlight-of-the-year experience for SE Total Rewards team. Your intro set the tone for the day and inspiration and learning ensued. Derek, Derek, Derek, yes, you need your name chanted a few times. Everyone pinches themselves when you’re in action. Like ‘Is this guy real? This is unbelievable.” A master of inspiration, connection, humanity, innovation and greatness. From the icebreaker, to the power of gratitude and D&I panel, everyone was fixated on your every word. Leslie, the Shire/Takeda culture transformation case study drove home how recognition is critical and 99% executive participation – a must! Niamh, you’re at the top of the list of the greatest, innovative Global HR leaders in the world! Your expertise, how-to work more human, make positive change happen, keep humans at the center is so impressive! SE loved your panel discussion!! Jim, Aimee, Sara, Steve, Kiernan, Paul and Jordane – it takes a village and your support with set-up, tours, interactions, warm greetings, friendly faces greatly added to the experience. Lauren, Stacey and Amanda – we couldn’t have done this without each of you. Let’s raise our arms in the air, start clapping, louder, louder … HUMANS ROCK!! Thank you, Traci, Mirfie and Jose\n\n121#Stealthy Talented Ninjas|You were all playing a critical role behind the scenes unknown to the 29 Exec attendees! Some of you were strategically planted as facilitators during the Living into Our Values exercise so we could gain insights about key individuals, some of you were responsible to ensure the technology we needed throughout the day (such as the video session with Gary Hammel and the videos strung throughout the master deck) worked without a hitch, some of you were our warm welcoming party and some of you helped capture critical notes from the entire day and assisted with scheduling for our own execs. You all played parts that were important to ensure that the day went as smoothly as possible, allowing us to showcase our strengths and content without distractions. Thank you for your positive partnership to ensure our guests left feeling that it was a day extremely well spent and that we were poised to gather as much insights as we could to use during post event outreach and communications. So many expressed that it was one of the best Learning Expeditions they have had! Congratulations and Thank you so much team for being such amazing ambassadors - we could not have accomplished what we did without you!\n\n122#Inspiring Greatness|Thank you to this incredible team of strategists for an impressive two (very) long days of concentrated best practice sharing, ideation, mind blowing progress on our dream state goals, and overall pure stamina. I was reminded again these last solid 48 hours exactly how much work you are doing and magic you are making at our most strategic customers. It is truly mind blowing what we can do as a team to impact the business. Thank you for your teamwork, your commitment to make the best of our time together, for helping to find the humor in some tough situations, and for being downright badass leaders. Each of you brought a perspective to our two day marathon that helped someone move an idea or a strategy forward. Each of you contributed your unique voice. Together, you make up the greatest team I’ve been privileged to work with. Onward to victory! Bravo!\n\n123#Keeping On Boarding Fun!|Thanks to this great group of fellow \"New Humans\" for keeping on boarding engaging and fun! On Monday we were a random group of people from various parts of the company (and even the World) and by Friday we became friends and teammates who now have a common goal...to make work more Human! I think we are off to a great start and I look forward to working with you all as our journey continues!\n\n"
