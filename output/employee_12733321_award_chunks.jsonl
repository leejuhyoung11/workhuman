"0#Capita Heroes!|Thank you to each of you for your incredible support during the Capita Design Lab pt.2 in London yesterday! It started off with me getting stuck in the lift.... It could have descended into absolute chaos but thanks to you all being ready to support, we were back on track! Nick and Joyce, firstly thank you for joining at the crack of dawn, it was so appreciated. Joyce, I was so glad to have your support and input yesterday. Knowing you were on hand to answer any tricky questions gave me such peace of mind and let me do my thing without any need for panic. You also saved the day by sharing your screen multiple times - thank you thank you! Nick, you jumped in with so much fantastic insight. The client left feeling confident knowing they were in great hands thanks to your solution oriented approach to a tricky program design requirement. Lu, what would I have done without you managing the logistical gymnastics of sound and visuals in the room!? Not having either wasn't on the plan but you adjusted and came up with a great solution all whilst giving an informative and helpful demo. James, you quietly sorted so many things yesterday between meeting rooms, demos for SLTs and much more! Your calm energy and input was so appreciated by myself and everyone in the room. Thank you all for your support!\n\n1#My Teams Usability Testing 🔍|Thank you for taking the time to participate in usability testing and share your thoughts on the new My Team designs! 💻 We truly appreciate your insights and are excited to incorporate your feedback in the near future!! 💡\n\n2#Ring the Gong for FM, Launching Recognition!|Team, congratulations on the successful launch of FM's new Bravo Recognition program, alongside their already live Service Milestones program. This new program is now live for FM's 5,500 global employees! This project was a long term commitment from many team members, and I appreciate this groups dedication to delivering an exceptional launch experience for the client through many unique and complex discussions. Thank you!\n\n3#Institutional and Client Knowledge Champs!|Dinorah and Nick, I wanted to thank you both for your superb support this week as I've been working to cover the LKQ launch project while another colleague is out of office. Nick, we ran into some weird issues with testing and in other areas, and you very kindly dropped everything to help me. You brought your vast institutional knowledge to bear, and while we couldn't independently solve the problems, we got the right people on the case and tickets in place! Dinorah, you've been a great help to me all week, chiming in with your knowledge of the LKQ contacts and program design nuances. In fact, you caught a small detail in an email that led to a massively important confirmation and re-configuration of their program design, less than one week before launch. This would have had a negative impact if we'd missed it, so thank you for jumping in. I appreciate you both!\n\n4#HI Certified|Nick, congratulations for passing your HI Certification.  Reviews included \"Nice work overall, Nick! You clearly understand what we do and why we do it. You did a nice job of weaving in competitive positioning - we're not just a check the box vendor, we are a true partner.\" Also you did a \"Good job answering all questions accurately and succinctly.\"  I know you took this preparation and presentation very seriously and your efforts have clearly shown through.  Great job!\n\n5#Investment Calculator - Master|Nick, thank you for bring your expertise around the Investment Calculator and showing the team the importance of this tool as part of the table stakes of a solid Launch.  During our 2025 Launch Team annual meeting, you were able to provide a number of scenarios for the team to review, digest, and discuss.  The feedback on this session has been great, the team is well equipped to manage through a number of scenarios that may come their way.\n\n6#Continuous Improvement|Jess and Nick, I want to thank you both for your efforts to ensure the Launch Team is constantly improving.   Recently you both came together to help the Launch Team focus on where our various Product Resources are kept when to use them and why.  In addition this quick learning included ways to troubleshoot situations ensuring we continue to deliver a quality production to our customers.  Thank you again for teaming up, ensuring our group continues to improve each and every day.\n\n7#The Launch Leaders! 2024|As we wrap up 2024, I wanted to extend my sincerest appreciation for this incredible group of humans! This year has been different from my first two at Workhuman, and I am grateful for the experiences and growth it has brought. 🥂I was lucky enough to work formally with both Nick and Matt. It is so clear how passionate you both are about making your pods the best they can be, and I have experienced this firsthand with both of you. 🎉Rich, I always value the insight you bring to any conversation and the camaraderie you have built on the launch team. It is truly unique and something to be appreciated. ❤️Amy, I am so grateful that I was able to work on Conversations with you this year. I have learned so much about different parts of the business and how things work. Even with unexpected changes this year, you took things in stride and focused on the future. 😊I cannot wait to see what this team will accomplish in 2025! Thank you!⭐🍻\n\n8#Continuously Sharing Learnings|Nick, I appreciate the working relationship we have and continue to have.  You and I started at WH around the same time, had a few launches together, and we continue to share learnings about the Launch and Customer Success world to this day.  You regularly lend a hand to help me out with talk tracks and specific nuance on functionality.  I appreciate you!\n\n9#Coming Together to Innovate for Qualcomm|Team QC, your effort in the last seven days was an absolute showcase of how Innovation is born from Imagination and Determination. What a week, what a win! Finding an innovative solution to a critical spend cap need has succeeded in keeping our relationship (and revenue potential) intact. How rewarding to see this team in action and the ways you each played a part.  Tom, your rapport with the VP of Comp made all the difference. Your advocacy and responsiveness kept him feeling heard, and made our priorities crystal clear, while solutions got sorted. Thank you, Christina, for tapping your super-power customer relations skills to support strategically and tactically. We moved faster and more collaboratively thanks to you. Kate, rolling up your sleeves and being all-in says so much about how you will show up for QC long-term. If I’m them, I’m feeling fortunate to have you and Christina on my side after go-live. Rahul and Nick, way to hustle in chasing down anyone at WH with spend caps expertise, and great job quickly testing scenarios and outlining a clear approach. So much of the magic is in the pitch. You nailed it, Rahul! Tony, Jason, and Grant, you provided the one-two punch of winning functional solutions. Your expertise in combo with making yourselves urgently available were the real game-changers. Dinorah, you’ve provided a relentless pulse of strategic guidance in the face of major headwinds. You’ve done it all right: posing Challenger-type questions, pointing to the goal of recognition’s impact, and seizing chances to make small gains. I see your efforts and know they will yield dividends as QC’s journey progresses. Likewise, Lauren, your focus on the “why” has helped round-out the team’s view of an otherwise tactical challenge. A shadowing experience for the ages!   Congrats, team, on rebounding from a potential showstopper to a satisfied customer and forward-looking launch!\n\n10#To Support Our Customers|In sales after you've brought on a new client, it's important to have confidence in your team to take it from there and deliver.  While I know Qualcomm (better than most) doesn't always make things easy, we are still in the business of serving our clients.  This team has been incredible through the design and implementation process, especially since they aren't exactly following our blueprint.  Recently during one of the many calls with their team, they threw us a bit of a curveball that could have resulted in being a showstopper.  This team rallied like no other to find 'the solution' to accommodate the needs of Qualcomm.  While a little nervous about the outcome, I'll take this team 100 out of 100 times to solve challenges and deliver for our clients.  Sending you a HUGE ThankQ for all your efforts to keep things on track with Qualcomm 🙏🏼\n\n11#Wintrust Launch Support!|Nick, thank you so much for all the support you have provided over the past few days for Wintrust's launch! I truly appreciate your flexibility in accommodating ad hoc meetings for all of my questions. Even during our brief check-in today, you took the time to confirm that I have presented all the right options to the Wintrust team, which was incredibly reassuring. Cheers to another successful launch!\n\n12#Bravo! to Our Ferguson Launch Team|Join me in celebrating the launch of the Ferguson Bravo! platform, which includes R&R, YOS, Automated Welcome Award and Celebrations to 32,000 employees across 5 countries in 5 languages.  Together this Ferguson Launch team navigated some tricky scenarios, ala confirming P20, delayed launch, and PM maternity leave to name a few! That said, Bravo! is live and powerful moments of gratitude are flowing to Ferguson associates.   Joyce, this launch was truly a marathon, and your expertise and customer focus made all the difference. Thank you for your incredible partnership.  Susana, thank you for establishing yourself as a trusted partner who it already to supporting them in their program growth. Matt Carlin thank you for your fantastic technical support, attention to detail, and even those last-minute updates! Your efforts are greatly appreciated.  Aidan and ihar, your branding design and implementation were absolutely fantastic and I sincerely appreciate you.  Matt Gillen, thank you for your expertise, support, and the much needed sense of humor on this launch.  Divya and Elaine, thank you for working with urgency to accommodate our client's requests.  There were many hands that helped on the TS and CL&S team and I appreciate each of you.  Bravo to this fantastic Ferugson Team!\n\n13#LKQ's Updated Data File|Team, extremely appreciative for you all in helping me get LKQ's updated file loaded into production. There were a couple of issues that were occurring and this data file load was time sensitive because of an update that the customer decided to make last minute. Although this situation threw us a curve ball, it was resolved and the timeline did not shift at all. Thank you so much for your efforts!\n\n14#Taking charge!|Nick, want to thank you for first inviting some of our EMEA collogues to attend our Design Lab Watch Party.  Not only did you take the lead on this invitation, you also hosted the session as well.  Showing our colleagues a design lab, chatting in Zoom, and helping others understand the opportunities and challenges post contract signing is very important and you did a fantastic job showcasing this initiative. Thank you!\n\n15#Dataload emergency|It was supposed to be a Monday like any other. However, a change in NG's datafile was preventing it from running and subsequently not allowing us to start the descendant process for ESO, which was extremely time-sensitive. Thank you, Nick, for connecting with me to run through the decisions we made and the potential impacts, and for helping me decide the best way forward, especially when I was about to meet the customer the same day and had to lay out our options to them. Kat, thank you so much for staying connected with me the whole day and helping to troubleshoot the datafile, ensuring it ran successfully in SDX in time to meet the customer's deadline. Rae and Niall, thank you for looking after the file in production for me, doing everything you could on your end to guarantee the file would get processed. It is amazing to be able to count on this group to get things moving. Thank you very much!\n\n16#Spin off data file change team|Team, I wanted to thank you all for your efforts and focus on getting the National Grid data file loaded without the ESO team this week! The timeline had been laid out to start cutover activities, but a perfect storm of challenges created some delay. Things like text format, column headers, ADL and other challenges but this group pulled together and got the file loaded and the ESO launch on track! Thank you!\n\n17#YOU truly made an IM'PACT on Moody's|Celebrating the successful launch of Moody's IM’PACT platform, featuring eThanks Recognition, YOS, CEO Award, and Celebrations Bundle, now supports over 14,000 employees across 40 countries. This achievement was a true team effort, highlighted by MS Teams integration, Service Anniversary Catchup for 2023 and 2024, Experiences (Sept 26) and the World Gratitude Day Award for all.  A heartfelt thank you to everyone involved: Lauren, your dedication and engaging demos were invaluable. Katrine, your exceptional partnership and trust-building with the client shone through. Luisa and TS team, thank you for your meticulous preparation of the awards, even with last-minute updates! To the CL&S, Mobile, QA and MS Teams Integrations teams, your support and urgency in troubleshooting our client's security and other nuances was crucial in meeting our September 16 launch date.  THANK YOU, you truly made an IM'PACT :)\n\n18#Taking a Moment|On this World Gratitude Day, I want to take a moment to recognize and celebrate the incredible work you do every single day. As high-performing team, you are the driving force behind our success. Your dedication, strategic thinking, and ability to execute with precision is what keeps us moving forward, and for that, I am deeply grateful.  You handle complex challenges with grace, manage countless moving parts, and always keep your eye on delivering results. Your resilience, adaptability, and leadership have not only helped us meet our goals but have inspired those around you to strive for excellence.  Thank you for your commitment, your hard work, and your passion for making things happen. Today, we celebrate the immense value each of you bring to the team.  Let's continue to aim high, push boundaries, and achieve greatness together.\n\n19#Successful Early Q3 Review Meeting|Team, thank you for taking time to join our early Q3 review of launch successes. We had an opportunity to reflect on 9/11, celebrate some great milestones for our team members, review our wins, and improve our processes.  The team did a great job during our break out session, collaborating and thinking differently around \"The Law of triviality\".  Thank you again for your engagement and participation during our review meeting.\n\n20#Qualcomm - Welcome to the WH family!!|Huge congratulations to Sameer and the team who were actively involved in the successful sales process with Qualcomm.  After a 29-month cycle, I am extremely excited to share that they are the newest member of the WH customer family adding 50,000 more users to our platform!  It was a win that required significant effort and strategy led by Sameer with support from so many WH team members along the way to ensure we had a positive outcome.  During the course of the process we had more than 70 documented meetings and every engagement and deposit made was very intentional. This included having several key Qualcomm executives at WHLive, many “moments that mattered” (YOS videos, Birthday videos, delivering WH golf balls/shirts, even a video from Snapdragon stadium which is sponsored by Qualcomm), a strong ABM campaign (Custom demo, microsite, mood video), and lots of customer storytelling to create unparalleled levels of credibility.  This sales process was a rollercoaster ride with lots of twists and turns resulting in a head-to-head competition with Augeo who promised the world at highly aggressive prices. But at the end of the day Qualcomm realized that our level of experience, product capabilities, and strategic value we provide are hands down the best in the industry and we became the obvious choice.  This would not have happened without the tireless work of all involved including Hari Date, Nuvs, Erin Avery, Cam Torre, Martina Campbell, Jason Gori, Meisha-Ann Martin, Larry Dennison, Alessandra Fagone, Brian Moore, Brian Kennedy, Owen Cooney, Christopher Claude, Julia Towle, Emily Smith, Hillary Mahoney, Chuck Labovitz, Rich Sorrentino, Rahul Srinivasan, Nick Eng, Ekaterina Kim, and Nina Reichert.  Thank you for going above and beyond to support this important sale!\n\n21#Launch Lyfe|I am so indebted to you all for your help on the implementation challenges and pitfalls section of my upcoming chapter. This is an effort I am excited about and have never done before. So when the editor asked for a section on this, I went to the experts. I knew you were experts which is why I sought you out, but man oh man oh man, did you ever show up and show out. This is nowhere near in your day job at all and I know you all have full plates and yet you made the time. No half stepping. You gave me so much to choose from and you even did a read through of what I wrote at the last minute. I can't say thank you enough. When I do something that stretches me and makes me a little uncomfortable, it is so great to know I have people like you in my corner to help. Thank you so very very much.\n\n22#Celebrating our Q2 Wins|Team, thank you for taking time to join our Q2 review of launch successes.  We had an opportunity to have fun, review our wins, improve our processes, and enjoy each others' company.  A review meeting is only as good as the input and energy of those attending.  That's why we always have GREAT review meetings.  This team always brings the energy and passion to our meetings and I am very grateful for that.  Thank you again and I'm looking forward to our next team get together.\n\n23#Thank You For Your Support!|Thank you so much for all of your support throughout the NIQ launch! We knew early on that NIQ would present some unique challenges, but as they consistently threw us curveballs each week, you were there to help ease my mind and strategize the best approach forward. From discussions around NIQ's current monetary program to navigating Workday and data file roadblocks, each week you collaborated with me to make sure I was on the right track and covering all of the bases I needed to. Your patience and partnership gave me the confidence to persevere and get us to launch. I'm truly grateful!\n\n24#5 Star Review|Nick, I want to congratulate you on a successful launch of Arabelle (a divesture of GE).  There were twists and turns, but you stuck with it, all while supporting your own team of LSMs.  The PM Sylvie Girbal completed our post launch survey, rating her project management launch experience as a 5 out of 5, adding the following \"A huge thanks for your responsiveness and flexibility during this launch process\".  Thank you for keeping our customers in focus, while at the same time juggling the very important responsibilities of a people leader.\n\n25#Workday Support!|Matt and Nick, just wanted to thank you both for providing so much support to Aptiv as we approach launched and had some challenges with getting production data. Things were coming down to the wire and this required a many internal discussions along with multiple connects with the customer. I appreciate you both joining me on some calls to troubleshoot with the Aptiv team which then led to successful datafile jobs in production. Thank you both!\n\n26#Creating an amazing team culture|Amy, Rich and Nick, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for making the time to meet me, answering my questions last week, and for helping me to settle in my new role. The opportunity to engage with our dynamic team in person was incredibly valuable, and I am deeply appreciative. When I joined the team, the first thing I noticed was the team spirit, and how everyone was there to support one another, and after spending a week in person with the team, I can tell we learnt this by example. So, I wanted to thank you for making the time on your busy agendas to meet with me, get to know me, not only as a professional, but as a person, and to make me feel as part of the team, even being 2.6k miles away (yeah, I have googled it).\n\n27#Rocket Teamwork!|Thank you all for making time for the call this morning with Rocket and for your partnership over the last few days! We were able to come into the meeting aligned internally on the needs of the client and the solutions Workhuman could support. I know Tim and Carmen appreciated the quick response and ability of the team to pivot quickly and support his needs. Great teamwork and communication by everyone!\n\n28#PPL Dream Team!|Team, I appreciate your efforts in coming together for Friday's check-in with PPL. This launch customer is near the finish line, and I appreciate each one of you taking the time to provide exceptional support. Allison and Morgan, I appreciate both of you showing up for this call! It was scheduled at the last minute, however, you were both prepared to talk about the various types of reporting we offer. Allison, you were so well-spoken and organized when presenting. Morgan, I appreciate you jumping into our launch channel with all the answers, as this request came directly from their CHRO! Nick, thank you so much for letting me lean on you throughout the call. I appreciate you coming up with creative solutions to keep this launch moving along! Thank you all for being the dream team!\n\n29#Continuous Improvement|Team, thank you for all coming together through multiple sessions and iterations to help improve the presentation and flow of our Launch Project Plan in Asana.  You all helped with suggestions and execution around consolidating tasks, eliminating waste, and improving efficiency.  With this type of continuous improvement we ensure customers continue to have the best launch experience possible, while ensuring our team members new and seasoned are able to execute efficiently and confidently.\n\n30#Praise from Prudential|Team, We're on a call with Prudential post-WHL and they asked us to thank you for a BEST IN CLASS experience in Sales and Launch. A little background, they spoke to many customers who were talking about their program features or different things, and PRU was proud to be able to say they had taken a best-in-class approach to launch! They had turned on most features and designed recommended award levels and approvals right from the get-go. This feedback is a testament to all the hard work that went into the in the prospecting phase and then when they came on board as a customer. Thank you for laying such an incredible foundation for this customer. I was privileged to work with you all directly and couldn't agree with this feedback more! They are very proud of the strong sales experience and successful implementation. Congratulations on this high customer praise!\n\n31#Thank You for the Coverage!|Thank you, Nick for your recent OOO coverage. During a difficult week for my family, you did not miss a beat with my clients. As always, I appreciate the support and empathy.   Thank you again!\n\n32#Design Lab Prep|Nick, I cannot thank you enough for your support to help me prepare for Aptiv's design lab last week. This was a unique situation that gave launch an opportunity to dive deeper into some areas that we normally would not discuss in so much detail so early in the process. We certainly had to think outside of the box, and you came to our prep sessions with so much to share. Putting together a productive agenda for Day 2, discussing the Workday integration in detail, talking through integrations and SSO, are just a few things that we went through and made sure fit what the customer was looking for in a design lab environment. Given that we only had a couple of days for preparation, I am just amazed at how much guidance you were able to provide. Thank you!\n\n33#My Heroes!|Nick and Ruchi, I wanted to thank you both so much for the urgent help you've provided this week as I was dealing with two super time-sensitive issues for Fidelity. Nick, this client has never been able to produce a \"clean\" sandbox file, and when they switched over to the prod version of their data file integration, decryption was not working as expected. They kept telling me it was an issue on our end, but you saved the day by quickly reviewing with me and noting that the problem was both easily fixed and on the Fidelity end. We got the decryption working programmatically this morning, which was a major step to our ability to launch in a few weeks. Ruchi, I went to push live today and got blocked with some weird errors. This was really time-sensitive due to the fact that it's a pre-requisite to some downstream steps to get Prod up and running for some pre-launch testing next week. You jumped in, deployed a script to deal with the mystery error, and helped me troubleshoot until the push was complete. I really appreciate the quick turnarounds and collaboration from both of you - you're my heroes this week!\n\n34#Dallas Fed Success 🙌|Nick, William, and Aaron, thank you so much coming together as a united front for Dallas Fed. Just a few weeks before their launch, Dallas Fed raised the topic of cash, and throughout our call each one of you chimed in to encourage them to adhere to our best practices. Despite Dallas Fed's initial belief that cash rewards would be a game-changer for them, they ultimately embraced our philosophy that cash is not king! This is a significant victory for their program, both now and in the future when they implement a point-based recognition program. Thank you for being the dream team!\n\n35#2024 Launch Team Offsite|Team, thank you all for an incredible 2024 Launch Team Offsite.  We took the time to celebrate our wins in 2023, had fun learning about other areas of the business, playing \"Deal or No Deal\" and \"Fact or Fiction\".  We had fun and learned a lot from Judy and Chuck, and to had time to focus in on process improvements around Workday, hosted by Matt Gillen and communicating effectively, hosted by Nick Eng.  Most importantly you were present, thoughtful and engaged.  As we continue through 2024 with our focus on the Strategy Board, we all play a part in achieving our goals.  I'm very excited as to see what 2024 brings for each and everyone of you.\n\n36#Key connections for National Grid|What an amazing group of humans. I wanted to thank you for your ongoing support of the National Grid launch. This particular client certainly took the best everyone had to offer and support to overcome many complex items. Things like understanding how plateaus worked in the US versus UK, purchasing power of points, carryovers of awards. Many specialized items needed to be addressed like transaction fees, UK tax rules and the ecommerce experience in the UK team. This group certainly pulled their expertise to help the team stay connected and move in the right direction.\n\n37#Outstanding Team Collaboration|Expressing the sheer incredibility of our team is quite a challenge. Each day, you all manage to astound me. A massive shoutout to Matt Gillen, Nick Eng, and every single one of you for offering exceptional support to our team. Your collaboration is truly outstanding and immensely valued. Thank you all for dedicating your time to collaborate last week - you guys truly rock! Rich, thanks for being my Boston buddy!\n\n38#Thriving on team Eng|Nick as my year and half on team Eng is coming to a close, I wanted to take a moment and pause to reflect on the journey we have been on together.  During this time, you have challenged me to look at my blind spots and not be scared of them but focus on them, seek opportunities to learn and provide support on those hard days. You have supported me sin June 2022 through 8 new launches, 2 post launch project and 2 more soon to be completed. Some stand out items are two crosswalks, Michelin's launch day award, and two-point carryovers. Along the journey I have picked up tips on best practices, who to reach out to and the best ways to navigate challenging waters.  The support you provide to your team every day is essential to keeping the team and our customers happy. I know you will miss me and the 5pm on a Friday calls for National Grid or figuring out gatecrashers at Activate. Thanks for all you do!\n\n39#Seagate's Successful YOS Launch!|Nick,   This award is well overdue, since it’s officially been a month since Seagate launched YOS!  Throughout pre-launch and beyond, your unwavering dedication, adaptability (considering the difference in time zones and hopping in mid-launch), and the level of knowledge you've provided to the Seagate team has not gone unnoticed. Seagate can be a bit of a challenge, and with a large launch project team, numerous detailed inquiries, and overall, a lot of moving parts, to handle their team with such ease, requires a unique set of skills and patience. Your effective communication and your strategic planning played a pivotal role in achieving a smooth, successful launch. Your ability to step in seamlessly, mid-stream, navigate through their perpetual queries, and provide the necessary support, showcased your exceptional expertise and your commitment to their success. Thank you from both Suzanne and I, for your invaluable role in launching YOS for Seagate! I know the Seagate team appreciates you just as much as we do! (P.S I imagine the picture added to this award is how you felt pushing the YOS live LOL)\n\n40#Paternity Leave Coverage|Nick, Shayna and Robin, I cannot thank you enough for your support while I took time away to be with my family. I made sure to disconnect and take advantage of bonding with my newest family member and was truly able to make the best of it knowing my customers were in excellent hands. Nick, thank you for bringing Seagate's YoS program thru the finish line! We both know the many challenges that can arise with this customer, so I understand the level of work it took to achieve this. Your additional support with Kohler and connecting with CT Children's is also greatly appreciated. Shayna, thank you for being an amazing partner to Kohler during my absence! While I was out, they made a huge change within their organization that affected their launch which I am sure made for some challenging conversations with the customer. You continued to be a great partner and provided me with all the information needed to pick things back up. Robin, so exciting to see that The Standard launched their program! We had complexities with this customer since the beginning and I know that even right before launch there were some more challenges that came up. Knowing how helpful of a partner you were when we were both working with the customer, it is not surprising to see that things resolved. Grateful for teammates like you, thank you all!\n\n41#The Buyer Journey Panel|I hope you are still buzzing from the amazing kick off last week and I just wanted to extend my sincerest thanks for all of the hard work and prep that went into making the panel a reality. I know I threw a weird format at you with all that back-and-forth, no one believed Ken could keep it under 5 minutes, and Meisha-Ann was pulling double duty speaking on behalf of both teams – but it turned out to be fantastic! I'm always mining for on-stage talent around here, so don't be surprised if I come asking again – you were all excellent! The work you put in to boil down your story and share its value definitely showed and I think you may have started a new session worthy of repeating at future kick-offs. Thank you for all the enthusiasm and for letting me jump in to help it find its way to main stage.\n\n42#Down to the wire for National Grid|Team, I wanted to take a moment to pause to appreciate everyone's work in getting the National Grid program WBAU award carryover awards to the finish line. Over the last few weeks there have been tons of slack messages, Jira ticket, and more excel files that anyone would ever want. Through this time this group has been responsive to review many versions of the files, persevered when things got complex and capability to go the extra mile when a 4:40 PM call was required (on a Friday).  This was a huge project and I truly appreciate every one of your supports in the project getting it to this place. Go Team!\n\n43#Arkansas Children's Awesome Launch Team!|Let's Celebrate the Arkansas Children's launch including R&R, YOS, and the Celebrations Bundle to over 6000 dedicated employees.  This launch was a true team effort with MS Teams & Outlook Integrations, recurring Wellness Points WBAUs, Gratitude Summit and more.  The Arkansas Children's Awards Feed is flooded with heartwarming and authentic moments of gratitude.  THANK YOU to every awesome member of this team that made this launch possible!\n\n44#A Superstar! ✨|Nick, Thank you so much for your exceptional support and guidance over the past week! Our conversations have been invaluable in ensuring that FRBD has a successful launch! I am truly grateful for your participation in my Dallas Fed datafile call to assist with Workday discussions. Your willingness to walk them through the process of setting up Workday and showcasing the portal is greatly appreciated. I am also thankful for the time you took to share your insights and expertise on Spend Caps. And let's not forget the fantastic pizza recommendations you provided along with your advice! Thank you so much for everything!\n\n45#Launch Report Assistance|Nick! Thank you so much for your help in sorting out the launches this quarter! I was at a complete standstill with all CUS organization calculations, and because of your assistance I am finally able tomove to forward in the process so everyone can be paid their Q4 bonus on time! Thanks so much for jumping right to it and getting it squared away so quickly. I appreciate your time and partnership!\n\n46#An overdue thank you!|Nick, this is long overdue. The amount of complex, random, and challenging items you have helped me with over the last few weeks is too high to count. A few of the highlights are the Diageo payroll file duplicates without missing a beat you pulled in the right resources from CL&S to help the this resolved quickly with meetings and emails starting before 7:30 AM. We have had many conversations on National Grid everything from how to cover GBP award values into USD/SOLI adjusted amounts to ensure a great employee redemption experience, to custom plateaus (that may or may not exist in the UK) all the way to configuration of the years of service program. I am grateful to have a manager that lets me run the show but is always cheering from the sidelines and when necessary jump in when called upon. Thank you for all you do!\n\n47#Celebrate! the MUSC Launch Team!|AN ENOURMOUS THANK YOU to the entire team that supported the Medical University of South Carolina's Launch!  MUSC launched Celebrate! with Plateau YOS, Celebrations Bundle and R&R set for Spring 2024 to over 20,000 employees and healthcare providers.  MUSC will celebrate its Bicentennial next year and needed a strategic recognition partner who would respect their 200-year traditions  while deepening their culture of gratitude and community.  Lisa, thank you for the awesome relationship you built with MUSC as well as the critical coordination efforts with our WH eCommerce team.  Dinorah, I am grateful for the strategy and care you provided MUSC, flexing to meet their communication/training needs on this quick launch.  Aidan and ihar, a tremendous thank you for your skill and hard work in meeting a tight timeline. Dylan, thank you for your thoughtful technical support and UAT prep.  To the Integrations and CL&S team members that supported this launch, thank you for your partnership and patience in troubleshooting and executing on SSO, WD API, MS Teams Integration and more.  CONGRATULATIONS to the entire team who contributed to and supported this launch!\n\n48#Q3 Review|Team, I can't thank you all enough for coming to our Q3 review meeting with such amazing energy!  The participation was great and I hope everyone enjoyed playing our \"Please let me in ...\" game.  From impersonating a plumber, throwing rocks at the windows, teleporting or riding a horse through a field.  You all thought creatively when it came to solving the problem.  I'm also excited to see everyone taking on the new enhanced huddle postings with such enthusiasm.  This team is ever present and constantly striving for improvement.  Thank you for being authentic selves in our meetings and everyday.\n\n49#RISE-ing to the Challenge!|Nick, Ruchi, Daniela, Gerard, and Sara - I cannot thank you all enough for all of your support in the days leading up to Mantrac's RISE recognition launch day. With a brand new team of program managers taking over a process they were unfamiliar with, Mantrac's nearly ready-to-go program was suddenly faced with some significant last-minute changes. Ruchi, thank you again for your determination and persistence to get crucial transformation rules in place and working - your communication and partnership is amazing! Daniela, thank you for intercepting and securing in place the incredibly last-minute changes the Mantrac team required in order to go-live the next day! Gerard, your support and insight to resolving their SSO issues the week of was so helpful to guiding Mantrac toward finding the right solutions with their team! Sara, thank you for your support with updating several of these tickets and making precise updates in Mantrac's config to ensure everything was ready for go-live! Last but definitely not least, Nick, thank you for your guidance, expertise, and partnership to problem solve with me nearly every day in the week leading up to Mantrac's launch. I am so grateful to have such an amazing team supporting our launches at Workhuman - thank you all!!\n\n50#Allison Partner and Cheerleader|Thank you, Nick for all of your help with Allison Transmission including troubleshooting, offering encouragement and advice, and support the Allison team during my time off. Our team is incredibly lucky to have you as our leader.\n\n51#Vacation Coverage!|Nick and Jamie, thank you both for stepping up and helping to cover my two recent vacations. It was great to be able to take some time away and be fully confident that anything coming in for me would be well-handled. I didn't even look at email or Slack once, which is unusual for me! I appreciate you both having my back.\n\n52#Amazing Team Purple for a marathon presentation!|What an amazing team for a marathon of a finalist presentation.  Thank you to each of you for the outstanding performance and dedication showcased during our finalist presentation to Truist Bank. Your unwavering commitment, resilience in overcoming technology challenges, and exceptional ability to build strong relationships and demonstrate our capabilities were truly commendable. You were ready to go for each prep session; you brought critical and creative thinking to the process; you made it fun and created a compelling story!  The 4-hour finalist presentation was a critical milestone for our team, and you all rose to the occasion with remarkable poise and professionalism. Despite encountering unexpected technology issues on the 45th floor and wi-fi/MS Teams connection, (even after the 3 hour prep the evening before where we tested each video and each external connection) your collective effort and adaptability ensured that we not only persevered but thrived in the face of adversity.  You pivoted, found new ways to show the particular feature/capability and why it should matter to Truist and the meeting was a resounding success…our coach whispered to me (and Lisa) upon exiting “Y’all did an amazing job!”! Your adeptness at having meaningful conversations with the stakeholders at Truist on the phone and at the table, showcased our dedication to building enduring partnerships based on trust, mutual understanding, and effective communication. Moreover, the comprehensive demonstration of our capabilities was a testament to the hard work, preparation, and talent that each one of you brought to the table. The expertise, creativity, and collaborative spirit displayed throughout the presentation underscored our team's competence and ability to deliver value to our clients. Thank you once again for your exceptional efforts and dedication. Together, we have demonstrated that as a team, we can overcome any challenge and succeed.\n\n53#Cheers to great backup support|On days like today I am grateful to have the support of such a strong team. The last two weeks have been busy with a client visit and time away to recharge. During this time, Shayna took charge of my current post launch projects that need help with data files, updating employee ID and making sure everything was moving along. Nick and Rich stepped up to help make my new launch feel welcomed while we received signed contracts and started documenting the short launch window. It was very reassuring that the team had my back with calls immediately when I got back to work. Thank you for being such a great team!\n\n54#Crushing our Launch Workshop|Team, I want to thank you for clearly coming prepared for our Workshop this week.  We all came together to practice presenting our launches, as if we were attending an All Hands Meeting.  These meetings are generally packed with exciting speakers and information, therefore when we get an opportunity to present, we must be tight, efficient and deliver on educating others.  Everyone did a fantastic job.\n\n55#Stepping into Product Research|….what does ‘Dataload’ mean to you...? Thank you to our interviewees, Des, Joe, Martin, Andrew, Alena, Luisa, Nick, Mark and Padraig, for the time you took to honestly explain your interactions with, insights of and some hopes for Dataload’s future. To our interviewers, Darragh and Edmund, thank you for capturing the valuable feedback and running the interview sessions. Jelena, thank you for leading the Product Research way, something new to many of us on the team. Sharon, thanks for mountain of mainly unseen thoughtful considerations and organisation!\n\n56#Dynamic Duo|As we celebrate World Gratitude Day, I reflect on just how fortunate I am to be working with both of you.  You each bring a different perspective to all our discussions.  You compliment each other like \"lamb and tuna fish\", or maybe you like the analogy of \"spaghetti and meatballs\" better!  Either way, working with you both has made me a better manager and a better person.  There is no obstacle or challenge that we can't tackle together.\n\n57#Thanks for the fast action to help when I was out!|Nick, thanks for the incredible flurry of action you took when I was out sick this week. With Mantrac especially, I appreciate how you jumped in to take the morning call for me and move on so many steps to get them ready for launch next week. It's a bummer they decided to delay another month, but working with the timeline we knew yesterday, you spent nearly your full day communicating with my customer's team, opening tickets, trying to getting their data loaded 14 times and sending detailed feedback, and sharing updates with me to keep me in the loop. I seriously seriously appreciate how much you had my back and how it let me focus on resting, I am still getting used to how supportive the team is of each other at WH and it really makes a big difference. Thank you!!!\n\n58#A Sparkly New Customer - Kohler $3M|Congratulations to Dawn O’Brien and her team on this exceptional achievement.  The hard work, dedication, and perseverance during this lengthy sales cycle has paid off.  Dawn led the ongoing work and successfully won this significant customer.  Thank you to the entire team for all your valuable contributions throughout the past 18 months.  If there was a selling step along the way to “check off,” this deal included it.  Two Workhuman Live events, pushed start dates, an onsite presentation in the middle of a snowstorm, a 2 hour plant tour, numerous dinners, demonstrations, business case preparation, a prioritization committee, a very controlling IT Team, a highly risk averse organization and a final approval process that required sign off from the CEO (whose last name is Kohler), were just a sampling of the key events required for this deal.  This is a new program build for Kohler and will initially include 25,000 global employees.    Kohler Company was founded in 1873 and is an American manufacturing company based in Kohler, Wisconsin. Kohler is best known for its plumbing products, but the company also manufactures furniture, cabinetry, tile, engines, and generators.  Kohler also owns several world class resorts including hotels and spas at St. Andrews Scotland.\n\n59#A Beautiful enCORE Performance!|Nick, a HUGE congratulations on getting Corewell launched! Right from the start we knew this was going to be fun as Beaumont and Spectrum were still working out the specifics of the merger and wanting to go-live the same day as their Workday integration (a Saturday before a holiday no-less). You dealt with some fun personalities and requests along the way and always kept your cool while providing them with the best guidance to keep the project moving forwards. It was clear that you had established such a good, trusting relationship during the original Beaumont launch by how quickly the larger Corewell team turned to you for advice and saw you as their trusted advisor every step of the way. While we may not have been successful in getting them to move on from their beloved $2 award, you helped build a strong foundation with their VP to begin conversations to bring in other revenue generating award programs. You should feel very proud for getting them over the finish line for a second time. Well done!\n\n60#The TTEC Experience|Team, thank you all for your expertise and commitment to getting TTEC pilot group to their launch day! From day one of the project this group presented some unique challenges around access to the site because of contracted restrictions to secure working environments. This provided the space for the team which included Nuvs, Hari, Sameer, and Nick to provide input on suggested strategy and tools to help navigate the unique requests of the client.  Joyce, thank you for leading from the front with me to keep TTEC focused on their goals and launch success. Amanda, thank you for being present and providing input though out the whole launch processes. Your commitment will help TTEC continue to be successful as they transition into post launch support. Finally, Adam, thank you for your support behind the scenes in makings sure everything was running smooth from creating UAT scripts, initial project setup to launch day cookies. Louie (TTEC’s Mascot) thinks you are all number #1!\n\n61#It's \"Element\"ary, my dear LSM!|Nick - We are actually, seriously 100% confirmed on the other side of Element's relaunch, and I'm long overdue in saying THANK YOU for making it happen for all 2,300 people in the data file! I knew from the first time I spoke with Jennifer that this project was going to need an MVP to lead the way each week, and from the get-go your organization and professional approach won her trust back. Week after week you set expectations and stuck to the project plan, keeping Element happy and fielding some of the most intense questions I've heard in awhile. After a few months I honestly started to wonder if Jen was quizzing us, but you kept composure and found a solution for the team whenever technically possible. I'd like to thank you personally for taking on all the hours of configuration and reconfiguration, JIRA tickets and the keeping track of those, and the quick and thorough emails back to Jennifer. This relaunch was no small feat, and you have truly won back a happy customer that is ready to reinvigorate their entire platform with us. Congratulations!\n\n62#Element Relaunch|Nick & Dan you clearly made a tremendous impact on the main contacts at Element.  Here is some of Jennifer Garcia's (Manager Employee Experience) comments, \" I wanted to really thank you both for all you have done for us over the past several months.  Once it got started, you seamlessly directed us through the project process, had great ideas, and were great partners.  We really appreciate all that you did to make our re-launch possible.  I know we still have a few more touch points but I just wanted to truly express our gratitude.\"  Then Kally Reinke (Director, Talent & Organization Effectiveness) piled on with, \"I second this! Thank you SO much! You both have been incremental in guiding this initiative and so supportive throughout answering questions, sharing best practices and more. It’s been very exciting seeing the new site come to life and watching our employees engage and recognize each other as soon as it had launched. Thank you for all you did to make this a success!\"  Getting customer feedback like this is incredible and due to the efforts you each put in.\n\n63#BINGO Winners!|Congratulations, Rahul and Nick, on your Launch Consultant + LSM BINGO wins! Way to leverage that free space, Rahul, to swiftly fill a line with the colleagues in your immediate vicinity. Work smarter, not harder, right? And nicely done, Nick, edging out Amy with a square only she could fill. Haha! Whether it happened via strategy or luck, it worked! Thank you both for being good sports, tapping into a bit of competitive spirit, and learning more about our special uniquenesses and commonalities.\n\n64#'Check it Out' - Bug Hunt|Thank you everyone for your recent feedback on our new Checkout in #Store-feedback.  Your feedback will help us provide the best possible checkout experience for all our users.  Happy Shopping!! :)\n\n65#Supporting Kent's Launch in the Final Moments|Nick, Luka, and Rahul - Thank you all for providing urgent support to help resolve some issues in the days and hours leading up to Kent's recognition launch today. This launch has taken some twists and turns as we got data for production just a few days ago, so the final changes and updates for their program led to encountering some issues at the last minute. Nick, thank you for helping me quarterback and take action when these issues came up. And Luka and Rahul, thank you for jumping in so quickly when we were 8 hours out from Kent going live in Dubai. Rahul, extra thanks for helping this same situation the day before when we had another error holding up some changes. Having your support and teamwork is so appreciated and it allowed Kent to have a successful, error-free launch today! Thank you!!\n\n66#Launch Team Q2 Review Meeting|I want to thank everyone for coming prepared and fully invested into our launch team Q2 review meeting.  These meetings are successful because of everyone's participation.  Whether you attended in person, remotely, or by providing email feedback in advance due to being on site for a customer launch!  This team is dedicated to delivering an exceptional experience for our customers and it shows during these meetings where we laugh, learn and reflect.  The best part was learning that one LSM has never had ice cream on top of their cake.\n\n67#Customer Coverage|Team, I am so thankful for your support while I took some time off as we welcomed our newest addition to our family, Jeevan! My start date of being out was never exact given the situation, but I appreciate all of you being so understanding and of course taking the time to meet with me ahead of time just to be prepared. It was amazing to hear how much was accomplished across all my customers such as a UAT session and a lot of program structure decision making. Coming back to work and meeting with all of you to transition things back was a breeze. I am so grateful that I was able to spend quality time with my family without having to worry at all about work. Thank you all so much for being amazing teammates!\n\n68#Appreciation from Element|Just a quick moment to share the appreciation from our PM at Element, Jen Garcia. She sent over an urgent request and as anxious PM’s do when the request impacts their CEO looking to give awards, they reach out to more people. You quickly jumped in to assess the situation and provided the best recommendation. It was an easy resolution on their side, but you gently guided Jen on next steps and expectations to put her at ease. She repeatedly shared how appreciative she was of your support and what a great help you were!\n\n69#Brain Trust|This is long overdue as I wanted to thank each of you for your support you’ve provided me over the last little while, including last week. The support varies from crafting training materials, backend testing, demos, project support, managing customer responses and calls, validation on configuration/data files/my knowledge and escalation coverage. Your combined support has provided confidence in the support Workhuman is providing to our customers and continuing their trust in us. Thank you for allowing me to tap into this brain trust and I appreciate each of you!\n\n70#The Final Count Down for Associated Materials|What an amazing group of Humans that helped come together in the final hours to get Associated Materials across the finish line!  This group was able to remove obstacles and keep things from derailing. Over the last two weeks we have had to update the program email address more than once, which required a deep understanding of prior and new configuration requirements. Make changes to the homepage two days before launch. Finally get the complex years of service catch up awards processed. Appreciate the support from this team to keep our customer happy.\n\n71##BigRocksBigResults -Module #3 -Class of May 2023|💡 “Whatever you are not changing, you are choosing\".

This band of superheroes have united to get Warner Bros. Discovery re-launched combing the momentous task of joining Discovery and Warner Media under a combined Workday enabled, Stellar Recognition program to over 36,000 employees in 53 countries! The project started with a new client team and the Workhuman team pulling together. BRENDA, you were critical in helping make sure that we had our basis covered by a strategic objective. MELISSA, you brought in an impressive knowledge of large complex client management. BRITTANY, your keen observation of the details allowed us to keep the project moving forward. SUSANA, the team’s historian brought over essential knowledge from the legacy Discovery program and was critical to ongoing support discussions. LAUREN, your ability to jump right while the project already had a life of its own was exactly what we needed to get this to the finish line. SHANNON, joining our team as we prepare for launch will ensure a smooth transition. NICK, thank you for your deep technical knowledge to ensure everything came together. This launch did take a full hero squad to this victorious day!\n\n75#Answers to All Questions|Hey Nick,   I cannot thank you enough for your ongoing guidance and answers to the many questions that I have posed to you. Your insight into everything Workhuman is priceless, and your quick responses are much appreciated.  THANK YOU!!!\n\n76#Jumping in together|Fantastic job to this team for everyone’s part on uncovering the root cause for Benjamin Moore’s constant MIS tab changes and the resolution. It had created additional manual work from multiple teams. Working together we were able to identify the issue, make and test the changes and confidently share with the customer the resolution. We were able to provide relief to the customer and set them on the path forward. I appreciate you all jumping into this one to delight our customer.\n\n77#Moment Maker Magic!|Thank you everyone for all of your hard work on the Freeman launch. They are off to a fantastic start to their launch day thanks to each and every one of you! Katie, Kim, and the rest of the Freeman team are thrilled with how Moment Makers has turned out.   My (new) tradition for my launches is to tie a ribbon to the plant that lives behind my desk. Look how much the Freeman vine has grown since the start of their launch! I'm excited to see how this program grows in the future.   Thank you again to everyone!\n\n78#KUDOS to this team!|I am so honored to have worked with such an amazing group of individuals that assisted in launching Recognition, Years of Service, and the full Celebrations bundle to 1,500 US based workers for Invitation Homes in 119 days! This was completed while using our new project management tool Asana, Workday API Integration, and rolling out MS Teams and Outlook integrations.  This team answered many Jira tickets on everything from custom approval rules to Asana access and everything in the middle. Jao- thank you for stepping up and being a great partner keeping things like years of service catch up awards on track and delivered on time. William - Appreciate you being on this journey and being a strong partner for many weekly calls. A huge KUDOS to this team!\n\n79#Much appreciated.|Nick, thank you so much for being capable and able to step right in on my customer calls. Yesterday I was under the weather, and all I had to do was ask  because you were right with whatever I needed. WBD is at a critical time where we needed to have yesterday’s call to keep the launch timing on track and you were able to take over and keep them moving forward. Also, Invitation Homes needed some last-minute data file changes, and you were ready to help out. I appreciate your commitment to the team and our overall success! Thanks!\n\n80#PTO Coverage!|Nick, thank you so much for covering me while I was out for a few days!

We originally expected this to take a few hours, but unfortunately, it took much longer than anyone wanted! However, this group of awesome humans was responsive, helpful, and had a proactive approach to solving challenges and removing roadblocks. I saw a tremendous amount of commitment, knowledge, and a strong work ethic throughout this process. You are all very skilled and do an excellent job managing and driving work for Workhuman. Thank you again!\n\n82#Costa Rica Coverage!|Thank you both for allowing me to unplug and fully enjoy my time off with the knowledge that Billings Clinic and Freeman were in such great hands!\n\n83#To- Do- List ✔|This week has been extremely busy for all 3 of my clients!

Continuous improvement is the name of the game and you leaned in, making sure your content was thoughtful and engaging.  You ensured the team understood the goal of the Workshop right from the beginning and you encouraged others to provide their feedback and real-world experiences, which made for a very conversational interaction.  You clearly put time and effort into this session.  I am looking forward to future Workshops, thank you for taking lead on this one.\n\n85#Kudos to you on an amazing Arch Capital launch!|Nick and Mary-Liz, many congratulations to you both on an AMAZING launch for Arch Capital! You handled those difficult conversations around change management/Arch segment demands with ease and built such a strong relationship with Julianne and Andrew as trusted partners, empowering them to be advocates for Workhuman internally. The perfect post launch survey results are a testament to your attentiveness and dedication throughout the launch. Can't thank you both enough for setting up the post launch team for success. Kudos -- pun intended ;) -- to you on this accomplishment! Hope to partner with you on more launches in the future.\n\n86#Difference-Making Journey|Thank you thank you thank you to my amazing Billings Clinic launch team! Your knowledge, patience, and motivation throughout this launch was invaluable. To say that I could not have completed this launch without each of you is an enormous understatement.

Thank you again for everything you do everyday to set Billings and all of our clients up for success!\n\n87#Men Behind the Curtain|Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.... Having those \"men behind the curtain\" during our Kohler presentation was priceless! Even though we had a large in-person presence at the Kohler Executive meeting, we all wanted to stay present in the moment, so we called on our all-around experts, Rich Sorrentino & Nick Eng to help us out.  We had a good group of Kohler executives in the room, but there were an additional 20+ who joined remotely.  Since we had a short window with a lot of material to cover, we suggested attendees submit questions via chat....and that they did!  Rich & Nick were busy in the background answering questions as we were soaring through our presentation.  Having experts addressing topics as they arose was perfect!  Everyone felt heard and valued, whether they were in the room or not.   Having those men behind the curtain was so helpful!  Thanks Rich & Nick for your support, sharing your knowledge, and making us look good!\n\n88#A true cause for Applause!|Nick, you mentioned Arch Applause as your favorite launch and full disclosure.. it’s been my favorite launch too!! And truly that’s been influenced by the amazing relationship and partnership you fostered with Julianne and Andrew and the wider Arch team. You could tell they found you a true delight to work with and not only valued your expertise and support but genuinely enjoyed and appreciated our meetings and your guidance throughout. Huge congratulations on this launch Nick- a true culture change for Arch bringing together all Segments. You can feel the excitement from the Arch team on the amazing impact and difference Arch Applause will have on the culture, unity, and engagement and that’s thanks to you truly ARCHing the program and all segments for the better!\n\n89#2023 Launch Team Offsite|Team, I can not thank you enough for bringing your wholeself to our Launch Team Offsite, coming right off the heels of Activate.  Everyone did such a great job participating and leaning into each and every topic.  As a group we were able to launch 66 brand new customers, averaging 172 days from contract to launch in 2022.  We had great guest speakers and every one of you ensured your voice was heard in each session.  I'm very excited to see what 2023 bring to this team.  Thank you for being authentic, thoughtful and involved!\n\n90#Top Customer Central Users|As I shared today on your CS Team call, you all were among our most active Customer Central users in 2022!

Thank you for your respect for customers and championing Customer Central!\n\n91#Gratefull|Nick, I am so grateful for your support this week. I found out very late that I needed to take a half day on Monday to help my mom out and without missing a beat you were there for me supporting with whatever I needed. Thank you for being such a caring leader to help me be successful as both an LSM and a daughter.\n\n92#4th Quarter Billings Clinic Teamwork|Thank you all for working together to support our friends at Billings Clinic in their efforts to come up with a plan for moving their program forward during a time of financial stress. I know Sandy and Kristin feel more at ease after speaking with everyone this afternoon. Your dedication and empathy shown towards the Billings team is incredible to witness.\n\n93#Hylighting the way for me!|Nick, where to even begin!! Thank you for supporting me before Hyland even started and helping me find the tools and learn the steps to getting to today - my first official launch day! You've spent countless hours preparing with me for key launch topics, helping me navigate difficult discussions, and keeping me focused on the core goals of launch. Not to mention, all the tiny steps you helped me get through with updating checklists, or even knowing where the checklist is to begin with! And probably most importantly, how you literally supported me live during calls with Hyland to help give me the info and resources I need to keep the conversation going smoothly - seeing the slack notification from you at times like that is like seeing a lifesaver when I felt like I didn't know what to do next! All of those things, along with even covering my PTO, when I felt so assured they were in the best hands, made this an incredible experience throughout. I am so grateful to have had you with me at every step of the way and help me figure out my own balance as I learn how to carry a launch from start to finish. You've made such an impact on my first year and first launch at Workhuman and I can't say enough how grateful I am. Thank you, Nick!!\n\n94#Congratulations on a successful launch!|Thank you to this incredible launch team! Hyland just went live and you all did such an amazing job to get them here. Shayna, you consistently kept the team on track and always had a clear agenda for each call to help them understand what decisions needed to be made. You were able to listen to their concerns while also providing our best practices to help them build a program they’re so excited about. Dinorah, the Hyland team was so impressed with the knowledge you brought and relied heavily on your direction for their comms strategy and were so thankful for the large group trainings you held! Nick, while taking on a more behind the scenes role you provided us all with such great support and technical product knowledge. Well done all around and thank you all for setting Hyland up for success!\n\n95#Quick Turnaround!|A big shoutout to this team for coming together so quickly to provide a great kick-off call for Corewell Health to get them thinking about what their new platform will look like. We had a large group from the client side, some who know the program well and some hearing about it for the first time, and you all did a great job of getting them to ask questions and participate in discussion. I’m excited to work with you on taking what was already a successful program and growing it even more!\n\n96#A 2022 - Thank you!|Nick, the Slack messages speak for themselves, but I wanted to thank you for all your support over the last few months as you moved into your team leader role (according to Spark 181 days ago). From day one you always provided your expertise and guidance on whatever I had going on and stepped up when personal things came up this summer. During that time some of the highlights were -PGE deciding they wanted Amazon two days before launch - covering for Michelin unexpectedly and the hand holding required to get things done - PTW helping with the password reset feature the day of launch - Patterson with helping create an employee experience to align with their unique program setup. Thank you for always supporting me, my growth, our customers and answering my many slack messages. I look forward to 2023!\n\n97#\"You down with ATD?...yeah you know me!\"|This is long overdue, as I have had the pleasure to work with Nick throughout the launch of ATD. To say it has been \"interesting\" may be one of the most loaded statements of 2022. What an adventure! As a result of witnessing Nick's expertise at client engagement and product knowledge he has been the unfortunate recipient of endless \"pings\" from me. Usually goes something like this, \"hey Nick, do you have a few minutes after our ATD call that I could run some questions by you?\" A \"few minutes/some questions\" usually turns into a longer conversation. Nick has a great ability to simplify rather complex scenarios and explanations into something concise and easily understood by clients (and colleagues). The result is turning a client that is stressed, concerned, nervous, or combative into a confident and receptive partner energized in their recognition program. Nick becomes a trusted advisor so quickly it is admirable. Nick, thank you so much for your support with my never-ending questions, and for creating a wonderful onboarding and launch experience for our clients.\n\n98#The Mobile Solutions|Team, thank you all for your expertise, advise guidance and readiness to help figure out a path forward for Patterson's mobile experience. As we are getting ready to launch next week some concerns about how the mobile experience works with a YOS plateau program only. This group pulled together with creative solutions, a strong understanding of how things have worked in the past and the flexibility to help with testing. I am so grateful for this village that I work with every day and each of you! Thanks!\n\n99#Thank you for your support!|Jen and Nick, thank you both so much for working with my customers as I was out of the office for a few days spending time with my family! I know a lot of items came your way and I am so thankful for your assistance during my absence. Jen, Temenos did not miss a beat while you were working with them. You organized their UAT feedback so well and were able to make many updates/provide explanations that allowed me to easily transition back once I returned. For Dana Farber, you were able to provide support to the team while they were testing out their YoS awards. They are about to launch on time because you you kept things moving forward! Nick, I know with Global Payments and Kenvue, there were many moving parts. Thank you for helping Global Payments test their YoS awards and work with them through some additional changes that needed to be made within the website. For Kenvue, continuing to assist with their branding changes, technical items like SSO and leading internal and external conversations related to their program structure. Both of you were also able to cover some calls and open various tickets that were required. It is amazing to be part of a team that provides so much support to allow each other to recharge. Thank you!\n\n100#YOS Guru|Nick! Although you've taken a step back with Prudential, I'm grateful for your dedication to assist with adhoc questions and taking the time out of your busy schedule to walk through some configuration changes for their upcoming expansion of YOS. You are patient, clear, and detail oriented - never missing a beat! You have been a fundamental part of their success and I appreciate your partnership (big time) behind the scenes on my first post-launch account.  You are an incredible teacher and I admire your thoroughness-hoping to one day be as knowledgeable as you. Thanks again Nick!\n\n101#You're the reason Ochsner is celebrating!|Congratulations to the Ochsner Launch Team on a successful and heartening launch!  The Ochsner PM said that it felt that Christmas Eve the on the Eve of their Ovations Launch to their 32,000 caregivers and employees that help change and save lives every day.  We met Ochsner employees 'where they work' by launching successfully with MS Teams and Outlook integrations.  Dinorah, your approach was knowledgeable, client-focused, and flexible as we continuously navigated twists and turns from our client AND all the while delivering successful trainings! John, you leaned into this launch from day one, offering a supportive and confident voice to our technical/product conversations. Brenda, your seasoned, natural delivery in front of the client (when called upon) is a pleasure to witness and absorb.

Jenn, thank you for your commitment to shadowing this launch as your engagement and positive energy throughout.  Beth and Lisa, thank you for bringing Ochsner to WH and for the continued collaboration.  Dan Fiore, a huge thank you - Ochsner required troubleshooting that ultimately ended in a shared celebration and bonding between the Ochsner and WH teams.  Laura, your ability to keep the Ochsner team focused on a VERY tight branding timeline was impressive and your design was a delightful slam dunk!  Ihar thank you for make the Ochsner branding come to life with all your beautiful finishing touches. Johnny Grant, thank you for your support of this launch in all ways, including a 'trickier than expected' custom approval rule and a last minute change request.  Hillary and team, thank you for your quick and decisive responses to Ochsner's payroll team- well done! A huge thank you to CS&L and QA team members, we could not have made this happen without your expertise!  THANK YOU to this amazing Ochsner launch team!  Congratulations!\n\n102#Great customer feedback!!|Nick, You did a great job stepping in to help a customer with some changes and get them into UAT while their LSM is on vacation. Since Monday, you've spent a lot of hours making these changes, fixing sandbox, putting in tickets, and getting ready for today's UAT (plus I'm sure there's more that I didn't see). It wasn't easy, but today's feedback from the customer was awesome and sooo well-deserved!!!. They said \"Nick, have we told you lately how much we appreciate you?\" We all do. Congratulations on this customer feedback.\n\n103#Good Vibes for Ochsner Teamwork!|Nick, an overdue and renewed THANK YOU for your teamwork, leadership, and expertise.  You are cool, calm, and kind in your approach.  During a recent troubleshooting session, the clock was ticking, and you continued to give off 'Good Vibes' that along with your technical experience got us to a swift resolution.  I appreciate YOU!\n\n104#PTW- Last minute SOS|Thank you both as we are on PTW's launch date and there was an issue with the employees setting their initial password. Appreciate you  jumping into research what could have happened and quickly figured it out. It takes a team to keep things moving forward. With your help and quick action, we have a happy customer on launch day. Go team!\n\n105#Delivering Excellence|Jen, Matt, and Nick, thank you for providing commentary and demos of your recent launches to the Customer Marketing group.  Each of you represented Launch, showing internal stakeholders just how awesome a team we are.  Everyone delivered tight summaries and demos staying on time and/or finishing early.  You clearly knew your customer and understood your audience.  Thank you for showing others just how great a team we are.\n\n106#Clients don't always see it, but...|We have an incredible team focused on doing what's right for the customer, even when we don't have the exact solution they are looking for.  Nick, you've been carrying this baton for a while now, and I'm always impressed by the thoughtfulness and care you put into designing potential solutions.  Claire, Dana, and Shannon, thank you for now taking that baton and ensuring we have good footing to take the relationship to the next step in the journey.  (Dana, thank you for putting yourself in our client's shoes).  Nuvs and Scott, thanks for partnering with us on what is viable now vs. what can or can't be a future design consideration. I'm confident we will get to where we need to - and that confidence comes from this team thinking about serving our customers well.\n\n107#Design Lab Watch Party|THANK YOU for such an interesting and engaging training today. Having the Slack channel to ask questions and get your proactive context throughout made it all come together. This was a really important perspective for the corp comm and customer marketing teams to see. Being able to connect with launch managers moving forward will add so much value to how we plan our marketing and communications, and hopefully in turn help for an even better launch process!\n\n108#Leaning into new processes!|Nick, we are hours from releasing the new Launch Score Card, tracking top 3 wins and challenges on a launch.  You enthusiastically jump right in, updating your most recent launch.  Thank you for leaning in and being first!\n\n109#Celebrating Bravery & Unfiltered Feedback|Launch team, I wanted to thank you all for your courage and authenticity during our recent round of project management process interviews, in preparation for the upcoming Asana rollout. Having dedicated time to talk through each of your feelings and ideas for the next generation of launch individually was such a gift. While it may have felt uncomfortable for some, the feedback from every single person was unique and valuable. You all understood the assignment and came ready with fantastic insights. My hope is that at the end of this month, you each see yourself reflected in the initial Asana rollout; it wouldn't have happened without you!\n\n110#On Point|Although it has only been a short few weeks, I feel lucky to have worked with you on my first launch! Your knowledge of all things Workhuman is amazing. I only hope a little has rubbed off on me. I appreciate all the guidance you have provided! You have done a fantastic job managing a challenging team and juggling it all perfectly. Thank you!\n\n111#Pru Crew|Nick, Dana, and Lauren-  hypercare has been a fun run with the Prudential team. The collaboration during post-launch has been critical to the strong relationship being built with them. The amount of internal support has shined forward to the Prudential team on our daily hypercare calls. The level of support being provided to their team is definitely not over-looked and couldn't be made possible without the determination of the Pru Crew! Just wanted to share my appreciation and send a friendly reminder that You Rock!\n\n112#Partners in Excellence initiative|Thank you all for taking time last week to be involved in an ongoing initiative that CL&S team are working on with teams on to identify common issues and bottlenecks we encounter on both sides of the fence when raising and dealing with requests from our Launch Customers. The discussions allow us a better insight into both how our teams operate and where challenges are faced on both sides when it comes to handling customer requests. This info gathered will be vital in helping our teams work more closely, improve synergy and identify solutions to help make a more streamlined and effective process of handling customer requests. Thanks again.\n\n113#Time to fly a kite|Thank you, Nick, Shayna, and Rich, for supporting my clients so I could have some much-needed rest and time off with my family. Time to fly a kite and go on adventures with my family. Having a team that can pick up and run with all the items juggling at any one time during a launch is amazing and then quickly get me right back in the mix is so important and allowed me to truly unplug. Thank you!\n\n114#Supporting us in an instant|Thank you, Rich and Nick, for coming in to support Jen and me at a pivotal moment on Benjamin Moore's UAT day. When we had custom configuration challenging us with errors the morning of, you both jumped into action, aligned the team, and within an hour, we had a resolution. Your knowledge of other customers' configuration gave us such helpful context for BMC's challenging design element and knowing what the right path was to take, so thank you for being there when we needed you!\n\n115#Grateful to be part of an amazing team|What an amazing group of humans that I am grateful to call my team! Over the last few months, I have been challenged in new ways personally and professionally. This group without missing a beat has been there to support me as a whole human. Helping my clients move forward, being a friendly ear or answering an SOS for help through Slack. In my career, I have never worked on a team that had each other’s back as much as this group of humans. Thank you and Go Launch!\n\n116#You Rock!|Nick, CONGRATULATIONS on the launch of Prudential's You Rock! recognition program that went live to 15,000 people today. You were an excellent leader and partner from Day 1. We were in sync early on---even with our coordinating vacation time 1 week after the initial contract signature. Do you remember meeting 5x before the kickoff to plan for kickoff? That was back in May. Since then, you met with Prudential 5-7 times a week minimum to ensure every facet of the launch process, decisions, deliverables, questions, etc. were covered. You sent follow-up information in a well-organized and timely fashion that enabled them to turn around deliverables or set meetings faster. We met with champions, business owners, core team members, and more...all with the goal of setting this customer up for success. You didn't just advise them. You really thought through the personas and rules and tested scenarios in Sandbox before sharing ideas with them. Prudential ultimately followed our evidence-based best practices with program design in every way which is a true testament to the information we shared as well as the delivery in which it was shared, and re-shared. It was a true partnership. I most fondly recall working with you on their Culture Aspirations (award reasons) and their Award Advisor. As it turns out, we're both total Award Advisor NERDS. It was a pleasure to brainstorm with you, share customer examples we could leverage, and be included in the process even if it wasn't directly related to my role because it helped us move forward with decisions and program communications. I look forward to when they can bring on the additional populations in Japan and Mexico soon! Massive Congratulations on a successful launch.\n\n117#Congrats on completing Prudential UAT|Nick, You accomplished something pretty big this week---Prudential signed off on UAT. Early on, they had requested 4 weeks for testing (most customers test for 1 week). Prudential then came back and requested a testing period of 8 weeks without impacting their Sept 27 launch date. This included 9 testers from Cognizant first and then a 2nd round of testing from 15 Prudential testers (including 3 from the program team).   Shayna, you did an excellent job getting all of the testing scripts built so the site could be thoroughly tested by both Cognizant and Prudential. Thank you for your attention to detail. It enabled them to test every aspect of the program before go-live.  Massive congratulations to you both on successfully completing UAT with Prudential. CHEERS!\n\n118#Launch and CL&S Meet and Greet|We have many new faces on the Launch side and on the CL&S side. We interact on tickets and calls so it was wonderful to put faces to names and get to know each other a little more. Fun facts we learned include our love of cats and dogs, painting miniature figurines, a drummer in a band, basketball coach, love of travel, sharing childhood video games with your son, amateur photographer, bartender extraordinaire, previous life in the TV world, hitting every baseball stadium, getting married at a living history museum, meeting your spouse at work and speaking Arabic, but we will still be after you Stephen for the fun fact that will only be shared over drinks. We look forward to our work together and continuing to meet the rest of our team members!\n\n119#The best Launch day Pit crew- Launch day|Wow,  is all I can say. When this team was presented with a challenging launch day award, they all stepped up to the racetrack. Every lap of the race there was unique challenges from two data files that did not want to run all the way to changing the email distribution of the launch day award in the final hour. This team worked together like a finetuned pit crew to get us to a successful launch day award exactly how the customer wanted, certain a first-place win in my book! Thank you!\n\n120#Michelin UAT Readiness|Thank you, team, for pulling together with some last-minute work get Michelin ready for UAT on short notice with some very last-minute decisions. Aliaksandr thank you for leading the initiative for a quick turn around and complete QA. Bryar, appreciate you stepping up and creating highly customized UAT scripts adopting them to the unique Michelin program.  Nick and Brian thank you for supporting my rush tickets to make sure the spend caps were enabled properly and just in time! Shayna thank you for helping do some important configuration and data file review/ update.  Proof that it takes a village to reach each milestone for our customers. Thank you for making this all happen in a short time frame.\n\n121#SSO Stress|A challenge we have had with Michelin is getting the right resources from the client for some technical pieces of the launch. After much bargaining and asking we got the SSO team to re-prioritize the work needed for launch and this meant for the Workhuman team a quick turnaround for updated metadata. This group helped escalate Michelin's concerns and advocate for them while I was on back-to-back meetings. Also, Luke was able drive this ticket to completion and get it wrapped up just in time! Thank you all for being such a great supportive team! It certainly takes a strong pit crew to keep the race going!\n\n122#Launching is a highway|Nick, launches in theory should be a highway. A nice straight line, a steady pace as we pass different mile markers, and a marked acceleration at the end, especially with a great driver like you leading the way. And then we get the interesting adventures, where I'm extra grateful for your steady hand at the wheel. With ATD, it felt like we had a backseat driver right at the start with their kick-off. Their direction felt contrary at times but you kept the team's eyes on the road ahead and made steady progress despite the blind spots, black ice and my goodness, the questions for when we'd get there. In all seriousness, you found new ways to explain our typical concepts so the ATD team would understand the ramifications of their decisions while not getting overwhelmed. You forged a strong relationship with PM Dora, and I saw her trust reflected in her steady conversations with us and her constant outreach to you to help her not only understand but also position things best with her team. And seriously, you were on all the calls, video on, smiling with patience no matter what was thrown your way. And I'm talking about some serious roadblocks at the end with the \"are we/aren't we mobile\" and some last-minute major program changes. I can't tell you how much I appreciated the commiseration, the constant contact and updates we had with each other, and the united front in providing the team with our best practices and our best foot forward (hopefully, on the gas and not the brakes!) We made it and I'm ready for that victory lap!\n\n123#Slack Superhero|Nick, when you combine Slack outreach + Super heroic efforts, you get a Slack Superhero?!  I was in the middle of a live training session for PGE when their employee attendees started reporting errors trying to give recognition while using their brand new program Spotlight.  From the minute I got off the call, reached out to you and Jen for advice and support, to your offer to meet with the PM Amanda and her tech resource, it only took less than 20-minutes.  Amanda appreciated our immediate support and quick response from acknowledging that it was a global outage and also when you followed up with the resolution per their request.  Thank you for stepping in to help this client in their first week of launch, especially knowing we were going into another training session tomorrow.\n\n124#Time away!|Shayna and Nick, I wanted to thank you for supporting my launches while I was on PTO for a long weekend. Having the support of my team made it easy for me to disconnect and know my clients are in excellent hands. Shayna you were able to push some essential changes live on PGE while managing customer emails. Nick you helped facilitate some challenging conversations on both Michelin and PGE.  Thank you!\n\n125#Demo Prep Appreciation!|Nick, thank you so much for your help and support during my demo prep! Your early feedback helped me find the right direction, and when I ran into trouble areas that I just couldn't figure out, you didn't hesitate to offer your advice to help me solve it. I appreciate that you're someone I know I can come to, to talk through topics I don't fully understand, and work through them in a way that works best for my learning. I'm so grateful to be on your team and have the chance to learn from you so often!\n\n126#Saving the day!|Nick!  Thank you so much for saving the day! As soon as I slacked you, you jumped on zoom with Robin and I right away to solve any issues we were having. Not only were you quick to help, but you did it in a very thoughtful and kind manner. We are eternally grateful!\n\n127#Time to recharge|Thank you, Matt, Nick, and Rahul, for supporting my customers while I was enjoying some much-needed rest and time to relax with my family. The team’s ability to have my back and run with all the items I had been juggling made it easy for me to unplug and enjoy this time. Matt thanks for your help with your Insight into the PGE years of service program adjustments. Nick thanks for running the Michelin call even with the PM tried to cancel it, the work you did allowed for us to keep our branding call later in the week. Rahul thanks for running point on the QA for PGE and all the questions on Michelin including starting their branding. I am grateful to have you all as part of my team! Thanks!\n\n128#A GREAT PRU CREW!|Thank you both for going above and beyond in your willingness' to help develop me as a new Consultant as we navigate the Prudential launch. It has not been lost on me how willing you both are to foster an environment that focuses on mentorship and the process of learning.\n\n129#Thank you for flying with us!|Nick! I cannot thank you enough for all of the support you provided during Jet Aviation's launch. I just wrapped up the handover call yesterday and during the feedback session, they had many positive things to say about their experience. The guidance you provided to myself and to the customer is a huge reason as to why they had the feedback they did. Thank you for taking the time to answer all of my questions through slack and jump on quick (and some not so quick) zoom calls to review my work. I also appreciate you being the main point of contact for them when I took some time off to spend with my family. This launch enjoyed the 'cruising altitude' stage but you stuck around till the end and I am extremely thankful for that. I have learned so much from you during these past few months, you truly are an amazing leader!\n\n130#Scanning to infinity and beyond!|To my amazing WHL scanning family - it takes a village and I am grateful for all of you! Not only did you show up literally, but you all showed up figuratively - when faced with various challenges. You kept the masses calm, came up with creative ways to keep the lines moving, smiled when the app/device/internet decided to take a break - you name it, you NAILED it! When we realized we needed more scanners for max capacity sessions, you answered the frenzied (ok yes, desperate) call for help! You were my Buzz Lightyears, (especially when I had that same look Woody has on his face in this picture) swooping in with a \"we got this\" attitude and a smile. While this \"job\" at WHL might have seemed mundane and thankless, it was actually mission-critical to the success of a large portion of the overall event and YOU are the reason we conquered! Thanks to each and every one of you for being the amazing teammates that you are!\n\n131#PRUving the WH Value|Nick and Lauren, Joe is a tough one to impress.  So, while this message seems trival it’s a huge testament to the work you’ve both done to build trust and show expertise that Joe clearly values. I’m actually a little jealous because I don’t think Marcy and I got this type of “reaction” from Joe (guess we’ll have to settle for the smirk he gave us once…lol). Well done and thank you for all you’re doing to continue to get Joe to WH Advocate status.\n\n132#Little Nuggets of Knowledge|Nick, Thank you for your help today with PGE. Over the course of the day, you have explained to me how to setup a program email address at a client’s domain and gave me some important nuggets of guidance on the award advisor conversation. Appreciate you sharing your knowledge. Thanks!\n\n133#Excellent teamwork|Team, I want to pause and recognize you for the extraordinary efforts taking place to transition Prudential from Sales to the Launch Phase. Alex, Marcy and Naomi, you all shared so much valuable information to helo us with this transition and we can’t thank you enough. Nick, Ally, and William, the dialogue, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing in advance if the kickoff has been nothing short of amazing. We have created a safe space to share opinions and ideas in a way that will ensure we meet this customers expectations. I am grateful that we are all on this one together. Here’s to a successful kickoff next week!\n\n134#Lots of kudos for Kudos+|Congratulations on Hess's recognition launch! Nick - great job working closely with Brent to get us over the finish line. You did a great job ensuring everything was lined up while also remaining flexible for Brent. Thanks for always making him feel supported even when he was in his own way. I'm thankful we were on this together! Thanks for being such a great partner! Ashley - Thank you for working on the internal marketing campaign with me. As always you nailed it. Their comms team was not very engaged in the launch process but you helped make it a bit easier for me when I had to navigate the conversations around the internal marketing campaign. Bryant - Thanks for being engaged and jumping on the calls with us to make sure Brent felt supported. Really appreciate you being there to help out when things came up! Thanks everyone! Congrats!\n\n135#Thank you for the support on my first week!|Thank you all for being a part of my first week with the Launch team! The warm welcomes, helpful information, talks about what we do at Workhuman and our values and mission, answers to random questions, small talk, and having someone to sit with at the office have added up to a great onboarding experience. It makes me excited for the weeks to come, so thank you for such a great start!\n\n136#Launch Team - Continuous Improvement Team Meeting|Team, thank you for coming together for the 2nd time this year to celebrate Q1 wins and collaborate on launch process improvements.  I was inspired by Nick's segment on trust and found another great Michael Jordan quote, \"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.\"  We have such a talented group of individuals, all coming together ensuring that we are always delivering the best launch experience for our customers!\n\n137#PTO coverage|Thank you Nick and Rahul for supporting my customers while I was on pto spending time with my family. Knowing Ensono's YOS got launched and BioMarin did not miss a beat with data file testing made me appreciate what a great team we have. Thank you ! (photo of my daughter enjoying her first Friendlies ice cream Sunday. )\n\n138#Hiring@Workhuman Interview Pro's!|Thank you to this awesome group for such a fun Hiring@Workhuman session today! I really appreciate you all being active participants, sharing your insights and asking your questions. Mostly, I SO appreciate that you all truly care about the quality of your interviews so we can ensure a positive candidate experience, while also ensuring that we hire the right human for each job. Thank you for your dedication to quality interviewing aligned with our company values!\n\n139#March Customer Webinar Success!|Team, this week's customer webinar on \"Uniting Your Humans in a Dispersed Working World\" went very smooth and successful! Based on the technical issues during the dry runs I was a bit nervous for game day, but all went well! Joyce and Nick, thank you for adding your touches to the content to craft the best message around access points, mobile adoption/MDM, creating moments that matter, and leveraging recognition for their return to work strategies and tying all of this to integrations, communication resources, and team awards. You both presented the story well and tied great customer use cases to each key point. Allison and Evan, there is so much that goes into all of the behind the scenes program management to get the webinars live. Thank you for supporting the promotional side, customer facing follow up content, and the very manual data insights for exec recaps and CSM actions. Mark, as always, your expertise in the webinar technology, supporting us from the office to ensure we have a stable connection, and your availability for dry runs and day of events is very valuable in making these events successful. Thanks to everyone on this cross-functional team to bringing a vision to light and giving our customers value add content that they can action after these webinars.\n\n140#Nordson's North Star|Nick, you have been doing an exceptional job of keeping us on task during Nordson's launch of social recognition. While the customer is familiar with YOS, social recognition is something that is completely new to them. You have consistently answered their questions patiently and thoroughly, not to mention expeditiously. The demo you conducted for a member of senior leadership was thoughtful, well-paced and covered all aspects of social recognition. You positioned yourself as a credible resource to the customer, anticipating their questions even before they asked you. The impact you have made on Nordson thus far is already apparent; this will definitely set the stage for continued success in this relationship.\n\n141#Energizer has launched!!|Energizer has launched and it could not have been done without all of you! The initial feedback after checking in with the customer was very positive and they are excited to incorporate 'CELEBRATE' into their culture. Nick, thank you for being an amazing co-lead on my first launch! I cannot share enough appreciation for the guidance you provided. You must have answered a million questions of mine! I have learned so much through working with you. Mary-Liz and Brenda, the support you provided on our check-in calls was so valuable and I am extremely appreciative of everything you did to get the customer ready to make the most of this program. Sarah and Cliona, the branding came out excellent, they signed off so quickly. Thank you for working with us on a quicker timeline to meet the customer's needs. Kevin and Dan, I really appreciate all of the technical support that you provided, especially in various instances where there was a time crunch. You both really came through for the customer. Luka, Gerard, Robert and Johnny, there were many tickets opened related to data files, SSO, etc and I cannot express how thankful I am for the support you provided especially with quick turn arounds. This customer had a faster timeline and they could not have been launched effectively without everyone. Great job to all and thank you!!\n\n142#Great Communicator !!!|Nick, I wanted to shout out a BIG THANK YOU for the strong communication and clarity on client expectations and providing assets while onboarding Milliken physical awards. These are not always straight forward processes however, you clearly explaining the client’s needs truly helps me provide all available options to any situation.  You were a pleasure to work with during this process - you asked all the right questions and followed all necessary steps to ensure the client has the right physical awards for their employees’ milestones. When the communication is there these onboardings run a lot smoother for all ! Thank you !!!!!\n\n143#Launch Team Offsite|Team, I want to thank each and every one of you for a great Team Offsite!  All of you participated fully, sharing your experiences, tips and words of encouragement.  From sharing your fun facts to leaning in how to show empathy to customers during a launch, I could not be prouder of the amount of \"yes and's\" that were used along with thoughtful discussions focused on Moments That Matter during a launch.  We celebrated 2021, highlighted the achievements of each other, and recognized our collective accomplishments.  I'm so excited to see what 2022 brings to each of you individually and as a team!  Remember, we are not just launching a program, we are helping our customers launch a culture!\n\n144#Great work with the JLL takeover!|Nick, thank you for the time and attention you've put in this week as you take over the JLL post-launch initiative as I take my leave from Workhuman! They are a very large and complex client, with a lot of programs and a relatively unique population. I realize it's not the easiest project to step into with all of the data file re-work going on, and with the fact that the project team has stepped into PM roles but were not involved in the initial launch. Best wishes wrapping this up and rolling out a fabulous new recognition landscape with them!\n\n145#Milliken's North Star!|Nick, Inspire is live and it’s largely due to you your tireless effort since Milliken’s launch process began back in July. There was no shortage of curveballs thrown your way, let’s be serious! Whether it be accommodating their request around manager packs, getting them comfortable around the redemption and E-commerce experience, oh and a month and a half before launch getting the news our two main POCs were leaving Milliken, then helping them roadmap that transition. There’s a saying “when you find your North Star, you know where you’re headed”. You were Milliken’s North Star, no doubt about it. In three days, the activity on Inspire is amazing, their CEO is even participating on the site! This is just a testament to the work that went in to making it all happen. On behalf of myself, Lauren, Lisa, and everyone else involved in the launch, we THANK YOU!\n\n146#Double the clients/Double the fun, Double Nick Eng|Nick, thank you.  It is hard to let go of projects so close to their Go Live dates as there can be lots of nuances, changes needed and question answering.  When asked if you could cover me for a week, you didn't hesitate and then did not back away when I told you what was occurring the week I away.  There were multiple emails thanking you for keeping workstreams moving forward.  Your timeliness and thorough responses enhanced our relationship with the clients.  You carried the workload (some unexpected) with positivity. Trust in your teammates while away allows you to truly disconnect as well as help the first day back.  Thank you for your support!\n\n147#Launch Dream Team!|Rich, Nick and Kat have done such an amazing job of stepping in and addressing all of the last-minute questions and action items regarding WEX's launch today. The dedication they have shown to this customer is world-class. They have all worked tirelessly and efficiently both internally and externally to ensure a smooth launch experience. Kat really got this ball rolling by providing comprehensive solutions to the customer's initial issues on Friday, escalating things to Rich and creating open lines of communication between internal teams. Rich and Nick took the baton and ran with it, meeting with WEX on a Monday morning call, logging urgent tickets and responding quickly to ensure that we hit launch day deadlines. Thank you for showing WEX what a powerhouse our Launch team is!\n\n148#Launch Team Champions!!!|Dear Launch Team, I wanted to send this recognition in light of what was definitely the busiest ever year for the launch team. There has been some super significant and biggest ever launches(YET!!) with Accenture, IBM/Kyndryl and more. Looking back on the launch notes of Jan 2021, seeing launches like Edgewell, RGP, Cree, LogMeIn, Organon and much more,  reminds me of all the incredible hard work and dedication that was done in the year. I am so glad that I have the privilege of hosting our weekly Launch Meetings and interacting and collaborating with all of you wonderful humans. RingTheGong is now one of my favorite slack channels to celebrate all the successes we have together. It's incredible to see how much is achieved. Over the year you have had new hires and its clear with all the new additions, the launch team is going from strength to strength. Amy you are outstanding at leading this team. Rich, You are the champion of the launch processes. Liz, you have just gone and launched our biggest ever client (#legend), Judith you know everything there is to know about launch and the true leader of SMB's), Shawn you are continuously knocking it out of the park and my go to with any launch question, Matt C, every launch of yours I see goes so smoothly. Matt G, every launch we work on I am reminded of your dedication to delivering the best product and success to our clients. Kat,  seeing your 1 YOS recently reminds me of how much work you have gone through that year, incredible. Kel, working with you on Kyndryl showed me how awesome you truly are and how much great things there are to come. Nick, seeing Hess pop up on Ring the Gong just reminds be of the amazing work your doing. Jen, Rahul and Jamie, I have enjoyed collaborating with you so far and you have all been a joy to work with. Looking forward to all the future launches and I am so excited to see what is to come. It is truly an honor working with you all and I am excited to see what 2022 brings for you.\n\n149#Kudos+ for launching YOS at Hess!|Congratulations Nick on launching YOS for Hess. Brent and team have certainly leaned on you to help navigate and guide them through the launch process. No matter how hard it is to read Brent sometimes (it's really hard!), you've managed to steer him and the team in the right direction and answer all of his questions to make sure we're keeping them aligned to best practice. Looking forward to having some more fun on the recognition side of the launch with you and Bryant! Great job!\n\n150#Standing Ovation|As the last of our launches in 2021 now live, I have to pause and acknowledge all of your efforts this year.  You had a combined 76 net new and post launch projects – take a bow!  It’s a grind of patience, consulting, leading, managing and of course rinse and repeat on the same customer.  You all have incredible talent to bring work human to our customers. The  passion for their success and giving them the best program possible is clear across this team. I hope you all pause and reflect on your own journey this year, how you’ve done individually and as a team. And Rich…You lead from the front with confident, conviction and courage. You push the boundaries for more for each team member to be their best, for our processes and for yourself. Thank you all for an incredible year!\n\n151#Launch Process Improvements|Team, I want to thank everyone for coming to our Process Improvement Meeting with open minds and positive attitudes.  Everyone was engaged while we discussed the \"Sales to Launch Handover Process\", \"Client Introduction Call setup and execution\", \"Agenda Management\" and \"Launch to Customer Success Handover Process\". Having a mindset for constant incremental improvement is the key.  Our goal was progress, not perfection.  Although with this team I'm confident perfection is around the corner!  I'm so proud of the team and how everyone has leaned in as we tackled each improving each process.  Thank you all for being present, participating, and doing your part to ensure the very best launch experience for our customers!\n\n152#Vacation Coverage Champ|Nick, thank you so much for keeping my launches on point while I was out of office last week! From working through Covance data load complexity, to answering all of Barings' questions, to escalating and opening tickets, I appreciate everything. This might have been the most work I've left behind, but I felt totally comfortable going on vacation knowing that you had my back and wouldn't let anything slip.\n\n153#Coach of the Year|Nick, I am nothing but thankful for all of the effort you have put in during these last few weeks to help me kick things off with my first customer. Right from the moment Jet Aviation was assigned to me, you were ready to answer all of my questions and guide me through each step which guaranteed success. I appreciate you trusting me to lead conversations with the customer but at the same time ready to provide any additional input when necessary.  Although we are at the beginning stages with Jet Aviation, I feel very confident moving forward because you are part of this launch. Thank you!\n\n154#Turning clients into raving fans|Nick,  Thank you for all your efforts with the Milliken implementation.  They have hit many hurdles during their journey.  However, with every challenge, you pulled the team together and solved the issues.  The ultimate compliment came this week from Anna.  She lit up when she realized Rich is your boss.  She was so happy to share how thrilled she is to work with you.  Thank you for all you are doing to build their new program.\n\n155#Patience, Persistence, and Planning|Nick - what a rollercoaster ride ATD has already been in just its first couple of months. No matter what mouth-dropping moment they surprise us with, you are always there with a patient smile, ready to guide the conversation on track. Regardless if it's a last-minute request to change the kick-off agenda, or being told in the middle of talking program design that we can't discuss it, or dare I say it - being told not to demo, and then having to demo over and over on each subsequent call - nothing fazes you. Your thoughtfulness and dedication into approaching the agenda and the team each week is commended - you're making the client feel heard and understood but also persistently guiding them to what they need to do, not what they want to do. Have I mentioned how much I appreciate your partnership, the internal conversations to prep, and your outreach to all invested parties to ensure we are prepared for anything that comes our way? Also, can I borrow from your endless bucket of patience? Now buckle in, and let's get ready for that next curve on the track!\n\n156#Launch Excellence!|Nick, I had the pleasure of attending a call with Milliken this week.  It was a run of the mill type of call, that I was attending while you were doing great work for another customer.  On that call, Lisa introduced me and no sooner did she finish, the PM Anna had to say just how \"fabulous\" Nick is!  She also went on to say, \"I don't know how we go so luckily, having him assigned to us.\"  It is these unsolicited types of comments that remind us all the impact that Workhuman team members have on our customers.  Great job as always!\n\n157#Flying high with this team!!|Team - I want to thank you all for your attention to detail, and quality work that is being done in the Jet Aviation calls. I've been part of two meetings now, and you all represent the brand with such passion, it's a joy to see you do what you do. I love how you all challenge the client, share best practices/insights, and really tailor to their needs and requirements. Excited to see this fly beyond their expectations, great job today and last week team!\n\n158#Customer Strategy People and Culture Offsite|Thank you so much for your participation and contributions at our recent Customer Strategy People and Culture offsite.  With our work environment changing so radically and the personal stress mounting, you all volunteered to be part of the solution.  You came with open minds and a solution-oriented outlook to address the main feedback areas on behalf of your respective team members.  From video communications and updated team rhythms to self-care habits and cross-departmental relations, your ideas sprung forth into actionable plans.  I can't wait for your peers to hear about them.  Thank you not only for the great work but for the positive attitude and growth mindset you brought to the discussions.  I'm very grateful to be on this journey alongside such caring teammates.\n\n159#Prepare for launch|As I reflect upon the last 4 months and the start of my journey here at Workhuman, I am truly grateful to be part of such a supportive team.  During this time, I have been working on learning the process of launch and the philosophies of Workhuman while every person has welcomed me onto the team, answered all my questions and has been more than happy to share their expertise and friendship with me. This makes me feel truly humbled to be part of such an amazing group of people. Looking into next week our team will continue to grow and I can’t wait to help welcome them with open arms as you did me. Thank you for all you do!\n\n160#Harvard Pilgrim YOS Cancellation|Thanks for helping me cancel awards for Point32Health. The CEO from Harvard Pilgrim left the new organization and there were a number of YOS awards pending with their old CEO. I really appreciate your time and patience with the report I had. The report had a mix of heritage Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts Health Plan employees, so not everyone on the list had an award generated. Hopefully this helps us get their years of service program back on track. Thanks!\n\n161#Another WUnderful Launch!|Nick, we can close the book on yet another successful launch with Western Union!  It's always a pleasure partnering with you on a customer.  While you own the relationship throughout the launch, I've always appreciated how well you partner with us as CSMs to have an engaged role throughout the implementation.  For a program that doesn't have a lot of restrictions/approvals in place, the first week has gone as well as we could have hoped regarding spend and overall activity.  It's a testament to the configuration you helped build and how well you prepared their team for their launch.  Their program team and leadership truly has confidence in an open peer-to-peer recognition program because of your work.  As always, thank you for staying involved post launch to close the loop and see everything through.  It shows them that you care much more than just getting them to Launch Day, but you're invested in making sure the program is a success right out of the gate.  Thank you again for all you do!\n\n162#Dynamic Duo|Nick and Lauren,  I am so lucky to have you two leading Milliken.  We hit a major snag with gift cards, but you never missed a step.  You both kept the activities moving, adding value, thinking of creative ways to help the client, and we are back on track.  You are both such great role models for determination and positivity.  I think this quote sums it up best  \"it is not what life deals you, but  how you handle it,  that matters most\"\n\n163#Good looking out!|Nick, thank you for your proactive reach out for my launch on Tuesday. Recently, Nick discovered a nuance to processing Years of Service awards when they need to be backdated.  He proactively took a look at our launch list and reached out asking if I had any files in launches coming up which I most certainly did.  Nick took the time to explain the timing of it all and made a suggestion of who could help in my unique scenario.  The client will never know of this interaction, but behind the scenes, this was a huge help in creating the best experience for their launch. Thank you!\n\n164#Making it Look Easy for Western Union|Nick - Congratulations on another successful launch! Jo and Russ could not say enough good words about you. On our last call, Jo commented on how you were able to make a  big project seem easy. There were some challenges along the way, from a misunderstanding about CIL countries to tricky payroll questions and you handled it all with ease and patience. Thank you for being a great partner to me and to Western Union. They'll certainly be an advocate of ours moving forward, thanks largely to your efforts! Cheers to you!\n\n165#Valuable Feedback|I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for taking the time to join my Roundtable session to introduce yourselves and spend sometime providing me with helpful context and feedback about your time at Workhuman - everything you shared was very helpful for me learning the business and looking for areas to quickly add value. I so look forward to our continued partnership!\n\n166#Thank You!|Simona & Nick, Thanks for jumping on a call today walking through the payroll/invoice process for RGP. Client had raised concerns and we wanted to backtrack what was agreed during launch & Bingo Nick you had the answer for us & Simona Once Again thanks for always doing a Fab job configure /launching YOS for client, both of you are Great assets to WH.   SJ\n\n167#Jumping into the Conga line|Nick, thank you for your support while I was out of the office just as Conga was launching.  It was great knowing you were there for support to my clients and as you experienced, they did need it in the those days.  Your quick responses and follow through resolved questions as well as any uneasiness that typically occurs days before a launch.  I felt in the know when I came back and couldn't be happier with where they were on their launch day.  Thank you for your support as always!\n\n168#Off to a WUnderful Start|Throughout the sales cycle we share with our future customers why Workhuman is amazing...and then there comes a time when our team has to back it up.  I recently had the pleasure of spending time with our friends from Western Union, and they were raving fans about this launch team.  No matter what they continue to throw your direction, it was shared that you handle it all in stride, patience and grace.  Thank you for continuing to instill the confidence in their team, and giving them the support they need to be ready to launch a world class program.  You are all amazing and appreciated!!!\n\n169#Going for the Gold!|Team, I want to thank each of you for participating in today's quick lunch time brainstorming session.  We know the amount of hard work, dedication, and finesse that is required of our team day in and day out.  Everyone shows up to win everyday and it is evident with the recent stellar feedback we have been getting directly from customers.  I really appreciate everyone's time and focus in our meeting today.  This session was just one of many, as we look to constantly fine tune and improve the launch process. I truly value everyone's input and I look forward to future productive sessions.\n\n170#Brookfield Stars|Simona & Nick, you both impressed newly launched client Brookfield via scheduled call yesterday with your outstanding support dealing with additional requests of addressing New Award Program & an increase of payments for YOS for an  specific group of employees, after the call PM Dallas Henault thanked both of you via email & wrote following :   Thanks so much for the great call and turnaround on these issues.   Well Done to both of you, You Rock! SJ\n\n171#Building raving fans one new client at a time|Lauren and Nick,  I am thrilled to have both of you leading Milliken's implementation. Your passion, confidence, and level of expertise blew away their team.  I am so proud and grateful to have such amazing colleagues building the Workhuman experience for our new clients.  Not only did I think you did an amazing job, but the CHRO also went straight to Anna's desk after the call and was ecstatic with our kick-off meeting.  He said, \"no matter what we asked them, they had the answers,  and gave us examples of other companies they had already done it with.\"   Also, our contact is so thrilled with all her interactions with  Workhuman, she has recommended to her husband, to get Workhuman into his company.\n\n172#New Employee Trainings!|Officially one month of training under my belt! I wanted to take the time to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for taking the time out of already busy schedules, and all your efforts to introduce me on all things Workhuman to help my growth. Amy - the launch success overview was so helpful to understand all the work and time that goes into ensuring customers are set up to succeed from the start Claire - appreciate you walking me through the data load processes, and offering to support when its really go time! Kara - the CSM overview you provided was invaluable from your perspective, and so great to see all the growth you had personally Christa - all things in the daily life of a CSM in salesforce was a great tutorial, and really appreciate you facilitating the follow up session once everything was up and running properly again Erica - the WHiQ overview you provided was excellent  Nick - the data/payroll files overview you were able to provide during such a busy week for you was really appreciated. Very detail orientated, I took the most notes from that session! Michael - both sessions admin functionality and Birst/RI were full of lots of technical information that you made easy to follow, and appreciate the tips! Kenny - reviewing the emails/digests was very helpful. you were full of knowledge and had some great suggestions for the rest of my onboarding. Also such quick follow up! Paul - the introduction to prod support you delivered was very organized and following up with the slides was much appreciated! Melissa- Gosh, thank you for everything. The weekly touchbases, adding me to shadow your customers, and being a sounding board has been a great learning tool and support to have. Tiff-  Thank you for organizing EVERYTHING, and providing so many of my trainings.  As well as your patience for technology :)  Jay-really appreciate our weekly check-ins and you answering my random questions - learning something new each time to be set up for success!\n\n173#Knowledge Sharing|Thank you for presenting at this weeks Customer Success All Hands meeting! Kylie, Sophia and Rachel - the stories you shared about how you are each working with your customers on DEI initiatives brought helpful insight that allows the broader team to think about DEI opportunities at other customers. Nick, Matt and Judith - Congrats to each of you on your recent launches and thank you for sharing your learnings with the broader team!\n\n174#2021 STRATIES Cup Finalist|Congratulations to each of you for qualifying as inaugural STRATIES Cup finalists! The STRATIEs are meant to celebrate innovation in customer strategy and the judges were in unanimous agreement that the level of innovation, imagination and quality of your presentations was incredibly high.     A HUGE thank you goes out to all finalists for your courage in putting forth an idea, developing it and then presenting it in front of the entire team.  It is never easy to go first. Someone must raise their hand and step into the unknown to blaze the trail for those who will participate in the future.  Bravo!   All of the finalist ideas merit progression and your leaders will be following up with each of you to discuss how we can help move them forward.   Very well done!  Thank you and congratulations!\n\n175#Re-imagining Performance Management with bp|To the phenomenal technical team behind the launch of the bp Conversations pilot, Thank you!!! Nick, thanks again for covering for me during my absence. You helped Kylie and the team prep for the go-live day. In addition, you managed the customer's expectations along with all technical aspects of the launch. Paul, you were our “go-to” SR lead. You took charge of ensuring we had the correct scripts running in for both environments. Especially in the final stages to get the site ready for pilot users. During the past few months, Gavin consulted on what the product can do to facilitate bp’s current initiatives. With your help, we were able to add hierarchical goals and company values for tagging. In addition, you connected with SR and DBA teams on getting those changes live in sandbox and production. HUGE shoutout to your squad: Yury Shulat, Andrew McAleer, Katia Davidovich for their efforts as well. You all worked many hours to make this happen. Users in this pilot will glimpse how we at Workhuman keep the customers at the center of all our efforts. Thank you!\n\n176#OOO Coverage|Nick, thank you for being my OOO for the Bp launch. There were many unforseen challenges to work through before launch day. You connected with internal teams and with the customer on all require configurations. Thanks to your efforts their Conversations pilot is now live! I couldn’t have asked for a better OOO.\n\n177#BP Conversations Pilot is Live - Thank You!|A huge shout out to each of you involved in the bp Conversations pilot going live on Tuesday 6 July. Sometimes it certainly takes a village to go live and this one of those situations so thank you for the important role you played.  To Gavin, Yury, Andrew & Katia, the conversations team who understood the urgency and reacted so quickly to support on all of the necessary changes to ensure production mirrored their test environment & delivered their requirements. To Stephen, Gerard, Paul, Kate & Robert who also acted with urgency to address any of the requests made to them. To Kel & Kylie who liaised with the customer, had regular calls during launch and for go live & held their hand to deliver and ensure we had a successful rollout. Kel loved the relationship you formed with the group during this launch.  Kylie you've established a great relationship with bp and that trust is testament to the rollout this week.  To Nick who joined the team in Kel's absence and kept keys parts moving, logging tickets, working with the customer and again delivering for them. Lynette & Ro thank you for being the subject matter experts, for guiding our friends at bp explaining the thought process behind the \"why\" Conversations work this way & what it delivers for them.  Thank you Lynette for launching to the pilot group yesterday and conducting an informative training session with your usual charm & insights.  I am proud to work with each of you and thank you for all your incredible work on this project!\n\n178#Brookfield Properties is live!|Nick and Lisa, Great work on Brookfield over the past few months. They are LIVE and have sent us really great feedback about all of the launch efforts. I was able to join in the home stretch and we just had to get them over the hurdle with their new brand guidelines. You all did just that and steered them towards best practices too.   To quote the team:   Thank you for your diligence, creativity and vision to bring this to life. It is 7:21am MST and I just logged into Bravo! – I cannot believe how full the Bravo! feed is already! This is going to make a huge, long lasting impact for our colleagues across the company.  You all did a great job guiding this team towards best practices and the impact is already being felt. Great, great work!!\n\n179#A moment that matters at Acushnet|Nick, thank you for organizing a thoughtful moment of recognition for our PM at Acushnet. We knew from day one Susan's goal was to launch Bravo before she left to enjoy retirement at the end of June. Unfortunately things didn't quite line up, launch has been delayed, and Susan is on her way to beginning a new chapter - but not before putting in a ton of effort to design a great program for Acushnet's employees. You knew how important this implementation was to her and made sure she had the chance to experience what a meaningful recognition moment would be like in our platform. Thank you for being so thoughtful to coordinate this moment that matters for Susan and giving Kenny and I a chance to express our best wishes to Susan. Based on her email earlier, she was very touched by the sentiment and is leaving proud of the legacy she will leave with Bravo. A few words from Susan: \"I thank you all for your message. You are all true professionals and I am grateful to have had the experience to work and learn from all of you.\" Kudos, Nick, for giving Susan a special sendoff from Workhuman!\n\n180#Completing the Transition|Even though Beaumont launched a couple of weeks ago, you both have gone above and beyond to make sure the relationship remained positive before transitioning to post-launch Customer Success.  Nick,  from the YOS catchup awards, to the all-employee launch day award, to the countless training questions, there was a lot to coordinate. I appreciate you extending your regular calls and continuing to meet with their group until we have closure.  Rich, I appreciate your leadership jumping in over the last few weeks.  You helped us get approval for some sensitive topics.  Also, meeting with Gianna earlier this week and giving her the opportunity to provide feedback over the last few months went a long way.  It demonstrated that we truly do care about their experience.  Gianna's most recent feedback proved how much she values the partnership the Launch team has developed.  As a CSM taking over this account, I appreciate all the work that was done to not only launch this client successfully, but developing the relationship where it's stronger today than it's ever been.  Thank you!\n\n181#Kicking off Hess!|Nick and Bryant - When we had our intro call with the Hess team we knew our kick off wasn't going to be ordinary. We followed the team's feedback about what they were looking to achieve, adjusted our presentations to meet their expectations, and remained flexible on the kick off calls to adjust to their needs in the moment - even using new technology to poll their teams on key decisions in real time. Great job prepping and making sure the Hess team felt supported and heard throughout the process. Brent and team now have what they need to move forward with their internal meetings to make the best design decisions. Looking forward to working with you both on this!\n\n182#Sharing your customer and project updates|Thank you all for participating in the recent Customer Success All Hands meeting sharing updates on the happenings with your customers and projects.  You can definitely see all the great work you've been doing with what you were able to share with the broader team.  We covered a number of topics around customer relaunches, launches, Moments that Matter, AWS migration and moving the needle with your accounts.  The details you were able to share helped educate the team with examples we can all learn from in sharing with other clients.  Thank you for your customer focus in all that you're doing with your accounts and making it real for the rest of the team.\n\n183#Being Extraordinary!|We’re live!  I owe you both a well-deserved, long overdue thank you for the work put in on this launch.  We were all swimming upstream early on here and I think at one point the project might have been in jeopardy.  Lauren, they had an idea of what they wanted in a recognition program, but your guidance and leadership throughout the entire launch showed them why you’re an industry expert.  (I regret not being able to join one of your trainings to hear the famous “soothing radio voice.”)  Nick, talk about being thrown curveball after curveball.  From managing difficult expectations out of the sales cycle around redemptions to coordinating last minute (literally) contract amendments, billing requests and an all-employee launch day award, there was a lot to manage outside the standard launch activities.  You didn’t miss a beat.  We had to do a lot to win this group over and I can thank you both for that.  Now that their hospital is seeing the light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel, I can’t think of a better time to launch a recognition program to reward all of their employee’s hard work.  Thank you again for everything that helped get us to this point!\n\n184#Beaumont Health is Live!|Hi team,  Congratulations on the launch of Beaumont Health. This healthcare system has over 33,000 employees and issued a monetary launch day award to all FT and PT employees to kickoff the debut of their program BExtraordinary! Nick, you did a great job leading the charge and overcoming some unusual hurdles. You were also flexible during their time of need---when they were experiencing their 3rd surge of Covid-19 in May that resulted in over 1,000 hospitalizations. Sarah, you followed their branding direction but they ended up deciding it was too hard to incorporate clinical versus non-clinical workers in the same image especially those without masks, so they pivoted and went with something more celebratory. Thank you for being flexible. And Mike, you've been there all along ready to take the handoff when this customer launches and answering questions as they arose. I wish you all the best. Congrats on the launch, folks!\n\n185#Recent Launches|Kat and Nick, I just wanted to recognise the great work that you both carried out on your recent launches! I worked with you on Fujifilm, Acushnet and Beaumont - these were our first launches together and I was so impressed by how smooth most of them went. Fujifilm and Acushnet ran incredibly smooth as far as launches go! Your organisation, communication and positive attitudes paved the way for success on both of these. Beaumont had a few directional changes halfway through, but again, Nick - you stayed positive, calm and communicated so well throughout, and we got there in the end with a design the customer was very happy with! I really look forward to working with you both in the near future on many more launches, thank you both for being great partners!\n\n186#Celebrating the Fujifilm Launch!|Fujifilm is live, thanks to your combined efforts! Nick, I couldn't have asked for a better co-lead for my first Launch. You were an incredible partner, patiently explaining things during our 1:1s, helping prep for client calls and tricky conversations, covering for me when I got COVID during a critical project week, and providing emotional support and humor when it came time to push to production! Danielle, you've been so helpful for our team and the Fujifilm comms team, going the extra mile to ensure they were carefully considering some key naming and comms decisions, and helping them to prepare for their Launch Day events on-site. Sarah, a huge thank you for compressing the branding timeline to meet the client's aggressive target dates; they are so impressed with the branding efforts, saying that the pages came out even better than they'd hoped. Mick, many thanks to you for sticking with the team during our weekly calls, providing insight into post-Launch life with Workhuman's client services team and offering up some key opinions during strategy sessions. Alise, thank you for answering all of my first-time LSM questions related to technical specialist partnership, and for the help along the way. This launch would not have been a success without you all; I'm grateful to have had this team with me on the journey. Here's a note from Rikke Rothe, the PM and key decision maker: \"We have enjoyed working with Workhuman from the very beginning. The implementation team has been fabulous, always well prepared, always quick to follow-up and share templates for inspiration helping us take the right decisions. Really a professional team to work with in all respects and kind people. Thank you all! BR, Rikke & Tina & the FDBD team.\"\n\n187#Quick turnaround!|Thanks for your super quick responses to my questions regarding a number of upcoming launches. With a loaded June calendar, Operations wanted to ensure we were fully prepared and knew about every wrinkle in each program! This will give us the optimal chance of providing the best customer experience right from the start with these new clients! Much appreciated!\n\n188#Teamwork Makes the WBAU Work!|Alise and Rahul, thank you both so much for your hard work over multiple days trying to run a test WBAU for Fujifilm's Appreciate and YOS programs. We're down to the wire on testing, and I know there was a LOT of back and forth via email, JIRA, and Slack. Matt and Nick, thank you for generously offering your time to review the configuration and talk through potential solutions. The success of the test awards was truly a group effort, and now we're set up for UAT success. Couldn't have done it without the whole group!\n\n189#We know that WE know!|Team, thank you so much for your participation and knowledge sharing at our training this week. There is so much that we can learn together as we grow as a team to create solid process, resources and guidance on the way we interact with our customers. Special thanks to those in the group that lent their voices and expertise to the training to further refine and enhance the experience for all. Now we can say that WE know!!\n\n190#Inspired by you!!!|Nick, a huge congratulations and well done to you on the launch of the Vitesco Inspire program. Vitesco are a spin-off group from another client of ours, you managed the transition for them to their new program absolutely seamlessly. You ensured the new program team were fully aware of all the inner workings they were taking with them, as well as the new opportunities for them as they launched a brand new program. We did have some challenges along the way with SSO however you managed these expertly and importantly at all times ensured the client's expectations were managed as regards the launch date. Well done! The Vitesco team are thrilled with the new program and have expressed how thankful they are to you on many occasions through-out the launch, thank you for your great work here! It was super to get to partner with you on this!\n\n191#Vitesco Valedictorian|Nick, on this momentous, long-awaited, long-anticipated launch day for Vitesco, I crown you Valedictorian. Despite all the obstacles that kept popping up last minute to prevent Inspire from \"graduating\" - whether it was a surprise infosec questionnaire, a Vanity URL that didn't work, SSO issues, the most complicated unredeemed awards/redemption scheme - you kept them steady and straight. You were really a principal and school counselor all rolled into one - firmly directing them where they needed to go (and what to do) and patient advisor to make sure they were pursuing all their appropriate contacts in a timely way. No matter what was happening, you were always calm and smiling on the calls, and a considerate colleague behind the scenes, keeping Tracey and I updated every step of the way. I appreciate your patience and partnership in our first launch together! I'm just not ready to toss my graduation cap and hit the after party until their trainings are over. ;)\n\n192#Testimonial Kings and Queens|I just wanted to personally thank each and everyone of you for taking the time to submit your testimonials. Your contribution is helping us build up our employer brand and really give the outside world a snippet into our  Workhuman culture . Thank you so much again.\n\n193#Teamwork Makes the Dream Work|Nick, thank you for your amazing partnership on the Fujifilm launch, and especially for stepping in to lead their weekly checkpoint today. You put this important client at ease; your knowledge and attention to detail kept them focused on deliverables and next steps. You were able to take a quick look at the agenda and pick up our conversation right where I left off last week!\n\n194#A Real Trooper!|Nick and I had a call where the client was less than agreeable, and Nick stayed calm, cool, and collected the whole way! In his \"Nick\" way of always being happy and chipper, he guided the client through the complexities of their build and gently nudged them until they were able to communicate their needs.  Way to be steadfast and an awesome human!!!!\n\n195#Spark, Sizzle, VentureFizz!|Thank you to each of you who contributed your own stories to the 'Why I Joined' feature with VentureFizz! Bringing your own spark to our employer brand story is so valuable as we continue to differentiate ourselves with candidates and build our presence as a top employer. I appreciate the time you took to share your journey to develop our brand, as well as your own personal brand!\n\n196#GRATIPLAUSE from Western Digital|GRATIPLAUSE!! ... From the WH Total Rewards Team  Liz B - Thank you for everything! Spearheading and leading the project team to a successful launch with many moving pieces and with a moving target - April 5th 2021 will live in WDC history! For all the countless edits and improvements along the way – ensuring the data file was accurate with Shiri S. and company.    Lauren S- Thank you for being a part of the Thursday night “Branding, Change Mgmt, Comms, and everything else” call. You are an honorary WDC team member. I will miss all the laughs and quizzical moments. It’s not “Pulse,” it’s the new Applause “Soundwave.” The best tagline too - the sound of recognition. Thank you for all the great work on the demonstrations for HR, people leaders, and employees.    Devon W - You are officially riding the Applause roller coaster with WDC – no turning back! We are thrilled to have you partner with us and helping us get to launch. Thank you for answering questions day in and day out. There is so much great work and partnering ahead of us. The road will be bumpy at times, but also so very bright.    Nick E- Thank you for stepping in during Liz’s vacation --- during Launch week! I knew when Liz said Nick E. would be stepping in --- and he has you covered, we had nothing to worry about. And she was 100% correct. It was like you were there from the beginning.    Sarah P - Thank you for everything around branding and the numerous edits… it took us time to find our brand with the soundwave, colors and CERA PRO but you were supportive each step of the way and we LOVE how the final site turned out.    Kara, Jay, Corbrina - We did it! Applause. Many years in the making. Thank you for all the help historically especially most recently in creating options & materials that our Executive team couldn’t pass up. Thank you working thru the holiday season to get a signed contract on December 30th ! YOU ROCK!!\n\n197#Applause for Excellence|Thank you all for your incredible efforts, teamwork and collaboration in launching Western Digital's new Applause site.  Liz - you have been absolutely incredible navigating through this launch.  Over these past few months you have been pivoting, adjusting, responding, acting, changing and doing anything and everything possible to make this launch a resounding success - and it already is!!!  You effectively engaged the program team at Western Digital to listen to their preferences, feedback and ideas to determine what was doable - and most of it in the end was due to your diligent research and analysis.  Lauren - I absolutely loved hearing your soothing \"radio voice\" during the training sessions.  You covered an incredible amount of material, because they wanted their associates to know about all of it, in just right amount of detail and with such clarity.  You have also done a fantastic job fielding questions and tracking down answers.  And Nick, thank you for stepping in to cover for Liz so she could take a super well deserved vacation.  You made the transition seamless by ramping up ahead of time and taking the baton that Liz passed to you on the Friday before launch.  I Applaud all three of you for your efforts so now the Sound of Recognition can reverberate all across Western Digital!\n\n198#Western Digital Dream Team|TEAM! Before I bon voyage, I had to submit this last thank you for all you've done to get Western Digital across the finish line. This launch has been years in the making, and it took so much effort on the part of so many people to finally bring it to fruition. Lauren / Devon -  thanks for being partners in all the calls, emails, and late nights. Lauren! I know those 8 PM Thursday comms calls were the highlight of your week and I am so grateful you made them happen (dad jokes and all!). Dan Forest - thank you for being my sanity throughout QA and configuring celebrations. You jumping in to help sort through the testing was such a help! Sarah / Ihar! Branding was a journey with these guys. Sarah - the million and one shades or purple / orange / teal, different graphics and (three?) different branding leads made a not easy process, but you made it look seamless. Ashley - thanks for all your help with graphics and getting things to just work! Melissa - for populating / repopulating / rechecking the site for A PERFECT demo 10+ times. Nick - for being my back up and jumping in even before your time when the client wanted to email us all! And finally - production support team, thank you for just making it happen. These approvals changes THREE times in the last week before launch, and you just made it work. Not to mention Kate helping save the day with production server caches, Brian helping sanity check how fraud works. Thank you for all the things you do team! We wouldn't be here without you!\n\n199#Vitesco Launch Praise|What a way to head into the weekend receiving proactive customer praise on the launch team. Cheryl Kelley, Head of Comp & Ben, shared the following message, \"We are nearing our launch date and wanted to provide you with a little feedback.  Nick Eng is our implementation manager and is doing a fantastic job.  We are completely swamped with our spin-off from Continental and have not always been the easiest to work with.  Nick has pushed to get everyone’s deliverables completed on both the Vitesco and Workhuman sides.  He is very organized and knowledgeable.  Joyce has done a great job as well.  It’s been a real pleasure thus far.  We are looking forward to our continued partnership.\" Enjoy this special message as you both have so much passion for Cheryl and Vitesco's program to be successful!\n\n200#A successful kickoff for Fujifilm!|Team, What a great kickoff with the Fujifilm team yesterday. The customer is ready to go and eager to get started thanks to all of you! Kat - you nailed your section! I know I mentioned this to you offline but you would never know that this was your second kickoff. You really know your stuff and I'm looking forward to working with you on this and many more in the future! Mick - Thanks for opening the meeting and building the customer relationship from the start of the launch process. Kieran - Thanks for all of the pre-work and ensuring that all of us were good to go for the kickoff and launch. Steen, Nick, and Alise - thanks for all of the behind the scenes support and efforts to help us have a great kickoff meeting.  Looking forward to working with you all!\n\n201#Winner for VentureFizz Article Submission!|Nick! Thank you so much for taking the time to elaborate on why you joined Workhuman. Sharing employee perspectives is so valuable in helping candidates understand what it's like to work here. I appreciate your willingness to take on this new opportunity with urgency and enthusiasm!\n\n202#Moments that Matter|Melissa, Kieran & Nick - Thank you so much for helping create this amazing celebration for Version 1! They have have been selected as a great place to work for 10 years in a row and we couldn't miss the opportunity to congratulate this incredible milestone with a short video. All of you displayed great energy and I can't thank you enough for making this such a memorable experience for our client. Melissa - Thank you so much for organizing and editing and uploading the video. You are a true star!! Here's the feedback from the PM: \"What a thoughtful gesture and very much appreciated, thank you & the team very much! Also congratulations on your Laureate Award as well as making the list again!\" and the feedback from their Employee Experience Consultant: \"What a lovely video and nice surprise this morning, thanks Workhuman!\"\n\n203#Getting the Job Done!|Hi Nick, I just want to take a moment to thank you for all your support over the last few weeks. You have supported me with various tasks/requests that aids in a first class client on-boarding experience. You are so diligent and efficient in all that you do and that really shines through - it is such a pleasure to work with you!!\n\n204#Appreciating You!|Customer Success Teams thank you for the amazing work that you do for our customers everyday! We wanted to take a moment on Employee Appreciation Day to appreciate all of you for your truly impactful work. Even in the remote world that we’ve all been in over the past year you haven’t missed a beat and continue to change the world through how you engage with our customers and other internal colleagues. As we strive to bring recognition to the global workplace you are all making an impact through your efforts, activities and thoughtful interactions. From, Jay, Jose, Danielle, Michelle and Amy\n\n205#RGP Support|Nick, Thanks a mill for making yourself available at short notice to join a call with RGP around some questions they had.   You made yourself available without hesitation and it was really appreciated by the Customer and my team.   Thank You for your flexibility\n\n206#Amazing Launch|Nick & Melissa,   I just wanted to recognize you both on an excellent launch completed with RGP. Throughout the whole process you were both so thorough in everything you did for the customer. It was really appreciated by the customer and it really made for such a smooth transition of the customer over to Client Services.   Thank you again for the hard work on this.   Enjoy the award.  Mick\n\n207#Rockin' launches, receiving rave reviews!|Nick! Congrats on two recent launches I’ve had the pleasure to work with you on. First, Nordson, a bit of a rocky start, but we all quickly found our groove with this YoS only customer, and you never lost your stride. Works Councils demos, questions, possible delays? Single sign-on? Username and PW? And round and round we went, but nothing threw you off your game. The Nordson team were proud of the program and platform you helped them launch, and their PM Michelle, a woman of few words, was sure to exclaim on our last call how happy she was with the result and how grateful she was for your hard work and perseverance to get it done on time and done right. And this week the long-awaited launch of RGP! If I’m being honest, I was nervous this launch date could get pushed and pushed with the many changes and complexities they had until the very last moment, but again, your calm nature, thoughtful answers and alternative solutions made the team feel extremely comfortable and have full trust in you (as do I). At the end of our project call this week, Lianne expressed her sincere appreciation for the many ways you demonstrated teamwork, resilience, innovative thinking and reassurance that everything would be just as they expected. And even followed that up with an email to say “You make us look good! You’ve been outstanding!”  I’ve enjoyed all aspects of partnering with you on these two launches, and I’m truly looking forward to working with you in the future. The learning curve is steep, but you’ve soaked it all in and are making your mark here and with each of your customers. Well done and congrats on two more successful launches to add to the list!\n\n208#All Star Customer Support!|Nick, thank you for all of your diligence and efforts on Nordson's launch. This launch was a bit unique in the set up being a YOS only client, but you were able to figure out the implications of that for the client. There were certainly a few curveballs thrown your way. I was so impressed with how you handled the situations and appreciate you connecting with me all along the way to make sure I understood what happened and how we were resolving. The responsiveness and quality of support that you provided went a long way with the client and has built a strong foundation for the account.\n\n209#Enabling our new hires for greatness!|Team- You have all been involved with our new hires, some of you have volunteered to be their buddies and others have taken on various training subjects throughout the past year(s) and some have stepped up to do both! A few of you have even helped with our interview process to ensure we bring the RIGHT people onto the team. You all have really helped with the onboarding process as a whole as it can get pretty stale listening to the same person (me) over and over again :) This effort is often something that is overlooked, but I wanted to truly thank all of you for taking leadership and stepping up to the plate by taking the time out of your busy days to assist with this very important process.  We will continue to rely on you as our team continues to grow, and really appreciate it!\n\n210#Cree is in Production!|Nick, congratulations on pushing Cree to production today! This is a big moment! I think this might have been the first launch you were assigned; although at this point, not your first customer launched. Funny how it works out that way. We started working with them, believe it or not, at the end of May this year. I don't think we officially kicked off until a few weeks later. Initially the intention was for you to shadow me on this project and in a fun turn of events, you took the lead instead. You did a great job too, expertly leading them through a number of program decisions and technical decisions such as SSO on desktop and username/password on mobile and Spend Management recommendations and configurations. They had a few hiccups along the way, such as their executive sponsor leaving the company and the PM moving into a different role. At times made these internal changes at Cree made it difficult to keep the team engaged, and you always pulled them back in. It was great working on this project with you and you are almost at the finish line with them officially launching in January! Congratulations!!\n\n211#Ready, Steady and Launch!!!!|To Amy, Rich, Shawn, Dan, Liz, Nick, Judith, Matt Carroll and Matt Gillen.  I wanted to recognise each and everyone of you for all the work that you all have put into the Weekly Launch Meetings with our team each Wednesday. I have been hosting these for a few weeks now and have been supremely impressed at the level of quality you deliver and excellent updates you provide each week. You all take the time each week to keep us informed on any urgent request, upcoming QA/UAT weeks, any autobau or wbaus on launch. I can go on and on!! Dan you provide the weekly spreadsheet each week to help us navigate the upcoming launches. Amy as every you offer such great leadership and guidance on launches. There has been so many clients this year we have all worked on. Even in the last number of weeks. Shawn you have managed Christiana Care,NCR and the exciting IBM project. Rich with the recent launch of Cytiva, State Street and Aviva. Judith you had Resource REIT, LLA, Moderna. Liz you have Manulife, Takeda and the new project for J&J. Nick with Nordson, Bobcat and now Cree. Matt C with 3D Systems, Amadeus and Snyopys. Matt G with P&G earlier in the year and now Health First and Edgewell. You all do such an amazing job in leading these launches. Congrats to each of you on every success this year and to many more perfect launches. Awesome work everyone :D if ever a team deserved a Workhuman Ring The Gong Trophy it is the launch team!!!!\n\n212#Building Another Very Happy Customer!|From Tyler Nelson @  Doosan Bobcat singing Nick Eng's praises! \"I also wanted to provide some well-deserved praise for Nick Eng. Nick has been an invaluable resource to our team throughout the implementation process. He has been professional, responsive, and accommodating – an absolute pleasure to work with. Despite being on a very short timeline, Nick has always had a positive attitude and has been a great partner for us in finding solutions to get HIGHLIGHTS up-and-running. He’s a true asset for Workhuman, and I’m glad we had the good fortune to implement with him.\"   Congratulations Nick!\n\n213#BaseCamp Informant|Nick, you did a small, yet mighty thing last week that deserved a big thank you! Thank you for alerting me directly of the change to Nordson's program assess url format change. During a call before the holiday to discuss Nordson's internal marketing campaign deliverables, I asked the team how they preferred their url to be formatted. With some input from both you and my experience the customer made a final decision (or, so we thought). All of these decisions about content then got filed in our Strategy and Consulting process as good to go and unless I hear anything from the consultant, Melissa Gomes, I proceed with designing the customer's assets. A few days later you saw that they posted in BaseCamp alerting us of a change to their url formatting. You knew based on our call with the customer that this was an important detail on Melissa and I's end, and instead of disregarding it thinking someone else would see it, you made sure to forward the BaseCamp notification directly to me (knowing Melissa was out). This may have seemed like a natural reaction for you, but I wanted to make sure you knew what your Respect for Teamwork meant to us. Had I not seen the information while Melissa was out (which I wouldn't have because I rarely have time to check BaseCamp and rely the consultants) I would have designed all of their materials with the incorrect url. This would have trickled down to either a mistake caught by the customer (embarrassing), or simply more work on my end to edit all the designs after the fact. Thank you for keeping me in the loop to make sure everything ran smoothly for the customer while Melissa was out.\n\n214#Wooing Works Councils|Nick great demo earlier this week for Nordson’s Works Councils! To paraphrase Michelle's feedback during your regular project meeting - “Nick, first of all, I have to commend you on your thorough demo earlier today. I have to admit, I was nervous going into the meeting. but their feedback was open and positive thanks to your detailed overview.” We knew the Works Councils could potentially delay launch or prevent a subset of their employees from participating on day one, but you fielded questions with ease, provided a thoughtful demo that hit on all the important points and followed up ASAP on open questions from the meeting. Another stellar example of your Respect for Customers. Well done!\n\n215#Version 1 Successful Launch!|Team, thank you all so much for the hard work demonstrated here to ensure the successful launch of our latest Irish HQ'd client and fellow Great Places to Work customer - Version 1.   I could clearly tell from my interactions with Jarlath, Reka and Carol how much they appreciated the professionalism and dedication of our team to ensuring success.   And its great to also hear about the positive feedback from their employees following launch on Monday.  Thanks again all - onwards and upwards!  Cheers, Kieran\n\n216#A CallOut For This Team!|Team; congratulations on achieving Version 1's successful global rollout of the CallOut program! Initial results from the customer speak for themselves! Celebrations and compliments on a job well done are rolling into the client's HR leadership group, but their note to you all speaks volumes and says it best; \"Just wanted to pop you a quick note, we went live this morning and all is looking great so far! Thanks for all your help, support and patience throughout the last few months – appreciate the help and guidance!\". Nick, no exaggeration to say that you handled this project like an absolute Workhuman pro - every. single. possible. topic. Your confidence and skill in delivering the most effective solutions for the client absolutely made the difference in this launch. Melissa, fantastic guidance for all strategic comms and especially helping to guide the customer towards best experience program goals for their associates. Guil, thank you for bringing your expertise as a CSM to every interaction, ensuring the customer felt we were prepared to meet their internal ambitions head on once they'd launched. Overall, strong relationships and guidance set the foundation for this project's success, and all of the surprise revisions, strategic challenges, and last minute escalations never disrupted the path forward. Version 1 is ready for maximize their program's value through your efforts, and congratulations again on this launch!!\n\n217#Teamwork and partnership at its finest!|Nick, these last few weeks working with the Version 1 team has been smooth-sailing with an engaged, responsive team who always asks the right questions and makes decisions with their employees being top of mind. We had an easy one, right? When I kicked off their trainings earlier in the week, their exec sponsor started each session with so many kind words about the partnership with Workhuman and how supportive the team has been to their PMs, Reka and Carol, throughout implementation, and this is truly thanks to your preparation, asking smart questions and commitment to getting it right. Then, we were thrown for a loop when some concerns were raised about a particularly sensitive topic. But you never wavered – from the moment it came up during the weekly project call to the moment we were given the final ‘go ahead’ for Monday’s launch earlier today (it was touch and go there for a minute). The solution seemed easy when all was said and done, but I know there was a lot behind the scenes you had to work through including bringing in internal contacts and sitting through my terrible math calculations to ensure we were communicating the correct information. Not something I’m sure you would have ever expected to manage during your first solo launch! Thank you for digging into the details with me, jumping a late and then early calls, thinking about solutions and always keeping in touch with the customer so they were set up for success. As our friend Reka would say, you’ve been absolutely “brilliant” during this entire implementation, and I’m excited for our future launches together. You’re a great teammate and partner! Looking forward to the official launch of CallOut on Monday!!\n\n218#PTC Launch Success|Liz and Nick, I wanted to recognise you both for all the great work you did on the launch of PTC. I know first hand how many urgent issues that propped up pre launch. I wanted to say how impressed I was at how you both managed each of the requests that came in. Helping to get the clients launch over the line. Liz for those urgent css spacing issues to rule changes. Nick you helped setup the SSO config  and the spend management rules and was impressed with how well these went. You kept on top of each incident keeping myself and the team informed via tickets and the launch meetings of all the changes that were needed so we could implement them quickly and get the client launched. This was alongside other work you both had for Gundersen and Takeda/J&J. Awesome work, Thanks :)\n\n219#Another milestone in the books!!|Nick, I have had the pleasure of working with you on some other launches, but hearing you today on your first SOLO Kickoff was great! You even led the demo while the Salesperson is on vacation and you nailed it! And it's not a typical demo--being only eThanks and YOS, but you explained what the experience would be like for them. I left the kickoff thinking they're in such good hands because you thoroughly explained everything from the awards, the YOS process, documents and what to expect. Great job!!\n\n220#Check, Check, and Check|Nick, thank you so much for covering for me this week. I know it was a big ask considering where Gundersen was in their launch before I took off last Friday. You done an amazing job keeping them calm, cool, and collected through the final stages of their launch. And don't think I didn't notice that there were over 100 emails sent between you and them on Friday alone!!! Thank you so much for answering all of their questions; it looks like they left no stone unturned in these final moments. It is because of YOU that they are able to launch Monday. Thank you thank you and you truly did a tremendous job. I am so proud of you!!\n\n221#Gundersen is LIVE!|Team, congratulations on Gundersen's launch!! They are officially live and already have some great activity in the system. As Stef mentioned on our initial call, they are a lean but mighty team, and they certainly proved that. Their launch was complete in record speed, and not without a couple of hiccups that we were able to overcome as a team. Noah, thanks as always, for your background support and ensuring they had a great technical experience. McKayla, you have been a great advocate for Gundersen and I know will continue to be. You were a true asset when speaking to the ongoing program support and I know the team is in great hands with you. Tiff, thank you for supporting both myself and McKayla on this. Nick, thank you for your support on this; I think it was a great learning experience for the both of us!! And Lauren, last but certainly not least, your years of experience shone through with this one. You got such great feedback regularly from the Gundersen team about your level of support and expertise. It was a pleasure partnering with each of you on this, and you should each be proud of this launch! Thank you!\n\n222#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt in the first week of go-live to make sure we have all your important information correct!\n\n223#Gratitude for 'Gratitude' at AVANGRID!|Congrats to all for the fantastic launch of AVANGRID's Gratitude program! So many individuals and teams collaborated to make this project a success. Starting with a strong executive relationship in the sales cycle, we were well prepared for the work ahead. Grateful for everyone's efforts across branding, IT, the core team workstreams, and especially to Joyce and Tiffany for bringing energy, expertise, thoughtfulness, and great teamwork to every project interaction with the client. Adapting to a few critical program structure and branding changes often required all of us to coordinate updates to the many visual assets, config, and training prep - never the same for each launch! - and the early feedback from AVANGRID's team and employees seems to demonstrate that we absolutely nailed it! We even had the opportunity to create a truly meaningful Moment That Matters for our project leader at AVANGRID to celebrate her 15th anniversary on the day of their service awards launch!! Cheers to a hugely successful future for AVANGRID's partnership with Workhuman, and thank you all!\n\n224#Launch after Launch, Success after Success|Everyone, I want to thank you all so much for the incredible hard work, determination, sometimes long hours and fantastic success you constantly bring to every launch you all work on to make these all a huge success.  Amy, I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing leadership you show with your team. Anytime we have worked together on launches. You are instrumental in the phenomenal success that we have with each of our launches.  Liz, You had one of the biggest launches of the year with Pepsi. I know first hand how much brilliant work that you put into getting clients to launch. It was inspiring and you set the standards for dedication and hard work. There were other launches this year in Santander, Corteva and Plantronics.  Rich, With one of the other major launch success stories this year in Astrazeneca. In particular, noting the incredibly complex drools rules. Not only AZ but you were key to some other great launches with State Street, Aviva, LAM Research and Sabre. Shawn, The experience you show on launches is mind blowing. We worked on a few success stories in Stepan Company and EMC Insurance, NCR Corporation. As well as upcoming launches like Day & Ross.  Matt Gillen, I can note the incredible work you did on Manulife and UCB. You managed these so well and I am sure the upcoming launch of Avangrid will be another success story.  Matt Carroll, We have worked together on some great launches. Omnitracs & Emerson were both fantastic launches. There are also some exciting upcoming launches that you are involved with like Teknor Apex. Judith, Working together on launches, you always stun me with the unbelievable level of quality you put into these launches.  There are so many launches with your name on it: Liberty Latin America and so many upcoming launches like LivaNova, RTI and Tracelink.   Nicholas, I have been so impressed to see the great work you are doing with both the launches of PTC and Gundersen. I'm sure these will be great client launches.\n\n225#LSM Induction|Nick--It seems like just yesterday that you started my onboarding journey. Time has flown as you SOARED in completing each Milestone-Demo Certification, Mock Intro Call, Mock Design Lab, Mock UAT Call, Weekly Role Plays for 8+ weeks, along with 3 different type of configuration practicals. I have to say, I am thankful you were the first to go through this robust LSM induction process, as you provided insightful feedback, put in the time to prepare for every meeting to allow you to execute flawlessly, and truly knock each milestone out of the park. I will miss our MANY meetings we have had together, but the silver lining is that you are now on the other side and managing customer where you will be an expert from the start keeping them on track and steering them into Best Practice! Great work overall and congratulations to you!\n\n226#Keeping State Street on Track|A huge thank you to everyone that kept State Street on track for their mid August launch.  Because of your efforts, even though I was on vacation, State Street has closed out the extremely important task of pushing SSO to production.  At least once a week, sometimes twice, someone from the State Street team tells me they have never worked on a project with such a \"tight\" deadline, nor made so much progress in such a short amount of time.  Because of your efforts this launch is still on track and I was able to completely, 100% enjoy my time off.  I had all the confidence in this team and knew State Street was in great hands.  A huge thank you to everyone!\n\n227#Grateful for this team!|Team, I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for your collaboration and support during this week’s two-part kick off with Version 1 - especially since I was jumping right in following vacation. Kieran, you have established an excellent relationship with the team that has resulted in a seamless transition from sales to implementation. Thank you for getting us kicked off and joining for the entirety of both sessions. Guil, your positive energy and cool confidence as you introduced your role, our partnership and what we had in store over the two days made the Version 1 team see what a valued partner you will be in the long term. And Nick, it’s easy to forget that Version 1 is an early solo customer for you. I'm so impressed with how knowledgeable you are not just about the technical features and but also our messaging. You came prepared and ready to answer any question that came your way. I’m really excited about Version 1’s launch and to be working with this hands on, engaged and collaborative team! Thank you all!\n\n228#Off to a Great Start!|Nick - Fantastic job on the PTC kickoff. I can't believe they are one of your first solo clients - you are such a pro. With a few kinks to iron out at the beginning of the process, you handled the many questions from the team with poise and confidence. You were steady where you needed to be, ensuring that the client felt heard and understood. I really appreciated the way you handled some difficult situations and am sure our relationship with the client will be better because of it. Great job and looking forward to working with you on both PTC and Cree!\n\n229#Great Start at Gundersen|Team, I want to thank you for all the hard work you have put in to speed the process along at Gundersen to try to meet their aggressive timeline. Things were complicated at the beginning with me being on vacation and then some other members of the team being on vacation, so it has been far from a typical launch. However, you have all pulled together and I have had heard nothing but positive feedback about the work you are doing. I can't thank you enough for helping pick up my slack while I was away and also just absolutely dominating this process so far. Great Work!\n\n230#Gundersen Health Coverage|Nick and Lauren, thanks for covering Gundersen and keeping everything moving during my vacation. It's refreshing to be able to unplug and even more refreshing to come back and see things still moving along, especially given their tight timeline. I'm glad we got to reconnect yesterday and strategize together. I'm excited to work on this launch with both of you!\n\n231#Under Pressure|Nick - nothing like having your second intro call EVER with an incredibly difficult set of personalities on the phone. From the start of the call, the client was - shall we say - forceful in their approach. They requested everything from daily one hour meetings, to sandbox access in a few days, to working on the weekend to get a jump on things. In addition, they broke the news that their intention was to roll out the program as quickly as possible then go back and fix whatever they needed to later. It's one thing to go through onboarding and HEAR how all these things might happen; it's another to have all of them happen at once so shortly thereafter. Amazing job handling it like a pro! Your face never betrayed any emotion besides understanding. You were calm, cool, and collected while you reassured them we'd work quickly to get them what they needed. You actioned next steps internally right after the call to make sure you were set up for success for Monday's kickoff! Well done under pressure. You'll have them in your back pocket in no time!\n\n232#A great intro to Version1!|Nick, we just hung up from our intro call with Version 1, and I have to say what a great job you did explaining the planning approach and reviewing their program details. You were prepared, poised and engaged which I'm sure gave their team every confidence in the world that they will be in great hands throughout implementation with you leading the way. I'm looking forward to working with you on this one and bringing recognition to Version1!\n\n233#Launch Tribe Superstar|Design labs can be tough (especially when they are role plays with all of your teammates), but you made it look easy!  As with every other task you've been met with, you've surpassed all expectations and gone the extra mile. From the outset of the meeting, you stepped it up and owned the CSM slides despite not being a requirement for the presentation. Your transitions between you and the missing solutions consultant were somehow seamless, your commentary weaving together your slides in such a way that I thought maybe Joyce HAD walked us through all the strategy and goal setting. Your pace in the presentation was excellent. You weren't afraid to spend time at the front end of the deck, asking the client questions that were well thought out and planned to help with your later talk tracks (award eligibility, nomination flows, approvals). You didn't back down from the tough questions - Amazon, $10 awards, gross up and peer to peer. Instead, you went back to responses we'd just given you and seamlessly made the connection between client goals and best practice. Your strategy was well thought out, completely clear, and amazingly executed. You made the design lab deck and all of the talk tracks YOURS. No amount of questions could set you off your path, you knew the points you wanted to make, how to make them, and how to get us (the client) there.  WELL DONE NICK! I can't wait to watch you in action with a client - you're going to fly!\n\n234#Great work!|Nick; outstanding work delivering your Introduction Call certification today! The team was impressed by your confidence and preparation, and particularly your ability to manage the questions/pivots required for this routine (and yet never routine..) call! You demonstrated a solid understanding of all key areas of focus throughout the call. As the 'program manager' for this session, I appreciated your setting solid expectations for each phase of work - you established a good strategy foundation where relevant questions aligned, while balancing the need to stay true to the realities of launch. Congratulations on this milestone in your training, and looking forward to more!\n\n235#Thirsty for more|Nick, I’ve been so impressed with your approach and diligence through your onboarding process. There is so much information to review and absorb, and then there is 2 more levels of details or positioning. With each session, you are already connecting the dots on those extra levels or asking thought provoking questions demonstrating your thirst for more. You embrace and enjoy taking what you’re learning from onboarding and applying it to other team members tasks. Keep being you and I can’t wait to see your journey!\n\n236#Demo Certification|Nick-Great work yesterday on your Demo Certification! You had the most lively audience, asking very difficult questions and you did an amazing job answering and pivoting! You went above and beyond the standard demo calling out the Workhuman Cloud applications in the global nav, highlighting we were focusing on recognition today! Also, it goes along way thanking the Executive Sponsor for joining this demo, as the tempo starts from the top and their engagement ensures success of the program! Throughout the demo you portrayed a high level of understanding how the site worked and nailed some of our harder talk tracks like SOLI, Workcircle, expiration of points(use by date), praise not the prize and so much more! Although the demo site was down during the redemption experience, you thoughtfully walked us through what we would see in the next few pages and why it is important to tie back the recognition moment during redemption. Overall, great work fielding all of the line drives that came your way! You remained cool, calm, and collected which I assume is why you received so much action!\n\n237#Certification Master|Nick - WAY. TO. GO! Many, many moons ago when you sat across from me in an interview room in the office (IN THE OFFICE!) I remember thinking - wow, he's taking notes. That's awesome! Now that you're an official part of the team, your attention to the little details, your note-taking and your execution with all the information you've been given has proven that first impressions were absolutely spot on. The first client configuration is never easy. The first client configuration when you can't load a data file to test is even more difficult! Nonetheless, you killed it. You were proactive about setting up time with me to talk through items that came up, never came to the table with anything less than a well thought out approach and had a list of things you'd done to try and find the answer yourself. Way to go jumping in head first! All of these things will make you fly!!! :)\n\n238#UAT Intro Maestro!|Nick, I wanted to say what a great job you did today during your mock UAT call.  You came prepared, even sending out an agenda prior to the call!  You did a fantastic job providing the mock UAT team a demo as well as reviewing the UAT scripts.  It isn't easy role-playing with your boss and colleagues, however, you showed great poise and confidence throughout the session, taking meaningful, thoughtful pauses before answering the questions that were thrown your way.  You have taken another step forward and conquered a difficult milestone as you hone your skills as a Launch Success Manager.  Way to go!\n\n239#“I can join!”|Nick, there have been a couple instances this week where I’ve asked if you wanted join a call or shadow some work time with me. Each time you’ve said, “I can join!” Whether it be datafiles, eligibility, or adding 4 programs to a client site, you’re diving straight in! I appreciate you joining me and for your thoughtful questions. I look forward to working with you more!\n\n240#Our Gratitudaires|Well done everyone! You were all fantastic, my god, such speed. Questions that took hours to put together and you crushed them in seconds. From the riddles, to the the funky hand dances (big respect Javier) and Sharons break down in the middle it was a rollercoaster of emotions to be honest. Enjoy your victories and hang in there Sharon, you've got this. CONGRATS!!\n\n"
