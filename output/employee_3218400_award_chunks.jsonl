"0#Looking both ways|We've got less days ahead of us than behind us on the journey to Workhuman Live Online. But there's no coasting downhill for this team. Some of the work is ramping up, some of it is continuing to speed along. You've all been putting forth your best efforts,  and many extra hours. The shared experiences build not only the event but also keeps the department strong. Cheers to you!\n\n1#Thank You for Everything|Matt - Thank you for giving me a chance here at Workhuman, for giving me the runway to figure out my way around the Marketing organization, and for being a person to always bounce ideas off. This is the best job I've ever had, and you're a huge reason why. I know I can speak for the other members of the team when I say that your thoughtful and consistent leadership helped us be as successful as we have been. You're going to do such great things at your new company, and they're getting an amazing person to help bring them to the next level. I'm trying not to sound too redundant, but thank you so much for everything. I wish you nothing but the best moving forward.\n\n2#Taking the lead!|Just wanted to thank you for all of your help and leadership since my transition to your team. You're super responsive and very understanding of the frustrations that arise day-to-day. Thank you for your help and guidance!\n\n3#Online and On Point|Matt, Jon, Jeff - Thank you for your quick work this week to make sure our WHL Online registrants have a terrific and consistent experience regardless of which website property they engage with. I am very excited about the overall look and feel of the sites! With gratitude, -C\n\n4#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n5#Thanks for the Google Analytics tour!|Matt, I wanted to thank you for all of your help over the past month. I reached out regarding some possible reporting tools for our new certification/customer sites and you offered to help get me set up in Google Analytics for much better reporting. Not only that, you took time out of your day to give me a detailed walkthrough of the GA portal to learn about the different types of reporting and where to find them. This tool will be a great help as we launch the certified professional site, and it will help us find the most popular pieces of communication that customers are accessing in our Customer Center. Thanks again!\n\n6#Partnering on Technology Procurement|Matt, thank you for all of your support over the last few weeks on new procurement projects and renewals. You have been so open and enthusiastic about working together, embracing our involvement, and taking the time to explain each software package you are considering. It has been great learning about a new area in Workhuman and I’ve really enjoyed working with you.  Thanks again, looking forward to working closer together in the future.\n\n7#Measurement for success|A bit late but I wanted to thank you all for your dedication, collaboration, and teamwork as we solidified measurements for Awareness, Perception and Preference. Learning and listening to each other through every meeting, I saw such great passion for accuracy and full transparency in the unknown. We worked together to present solid recommendations, and received great feedback. With our next steps to operationalize, use Q1-Q2 2020 as litmus on measurements, and prepare for QBRs together we'll create the best measurable Brand marketing we've ever had. I couldn't be more proud of this team.\n\n8#Negotiation Dream Team|Thomasina, Niall and Matt, thank you so much for all of your help and guidance navigating the Sendoso contract revisions. Each of you carefully helped to create a well thought out plan to get clauses written for us around quality, SLAs and even stability into one constructive conversation. The explanation to Sendoso's team went so smoothly it appears that we will be able to get everything included as a part of the new contract. Thank you again for all of the hard work and I truly appreciate the teamwork!!\n\n9#Trusting the process!|Team - thank you for buying into and committing to the new process and approach we're using to develop an integrated and collaborative 2H Marketing Plan (ie., offsite, collaboration, data-driven goal setting, etc.). Because of your willingness to lean into this new way of working we've been able to advance new creative, powerful, innovative ideas for 2H digital programming, virtual engagements, and WHL-S that tap into the zeitgeist, create urgency, represent that Companies that thrive Workhuman, in a way that is unique to our Brand and business. With gratitude, Chris & Patti\n\n10#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n11#The future is now. The future is working human.|Team - this group has been the nucleus for \"what's next.\" You've ripped up and thrown away the rule book for what was. You've embraced the freedom, liberation and inspiration that comes from having a blank sheet of paper to operate from. Yes, we've been grinding the last two weeks, but we are on the precipices of exciting concepts that will propel our brand and business forward. Keep pushing, we're nearly there. With gratitude, -C\n\n12#All in a day's work|THIS. TEAM. Day in and day out, you rally to turn around quick requests when necessary. You challenge each other to make our processes smoother and more efficient. You ask the difficult questions. You take the time and create the head space to stop, reflect, analyze and propose new ideas. Even when it's stressful or dare I say, frustrating for reasons sometimes out of our immediate control, you stay engaged and focused on the end game. Ever committed to evolving our digital experiences in big and small ways because we all understand there's never a silver bullet. It's a combination of MANY efforts that will ultimately lead us where we want to go. I value your vast talents, strong work ethic, sense of humor, and most of all, the true partnership this web team has cultivated even while being physically apart for the last three months....and I remain ever so grateful for all that you do in a day's work. Thank you for making us better in more ways than one.\n\n13#SEO Wins!|As a result of your hard work and incredible skills with our SEO, we're seeing some great inbound activity. Just this week in PR activity we had one journalist (from the WSJ!) reach out because of Eric's video and one article published that referenced Workhuman insight from 2019. All the work you're doing to keep Workhuman in front of people is really paying off - thank you!\n\n14#What Makes Us Human: Heart and Soul|Team, when most of us are feeling defeated, deflated, and hopeless, each of you came together to unite our hearts and souls with the people we most want to reach. I shed more than one tear experiencing the imagery and messages of hope and pragmatism. Your respect, empathy, and compassion for all hearts and souls inside and outside of our company has made an impact.  Thank you for transforming a sad exception to our lives into one that brings us together instead of dividing us all.  As always, thank you for your hard work and determination to Workhuman. Best, Patti\n\n15#An Amazing welcome|I just wanted to thank everyone for an amazing welcoming to the team. You guys have managed to create a lot of excitement for me. I cannot wait to get involved in all the different projects and good times we have coming up ahead of us.  Thank you\n\n16#Masters of Your Universe!|Do a digital event they said.  Do it in a month, too.  With lots of video, and new tech integrations, and a massive simultaneous user load.  And oh yeah – keep all those other web project rolling along at the same time.  You know, a product launch, and COVID content, and a Healthcare campaign.  We basically tossed 3 months worth of work at you guys to tackle in just weeks – and you stepped up like never before.  From weekend work, to live editing, to solution creation, and perhaps even some impressive crisis management that really saved the day.  We couldn’t have pulled of what we did without you both behind the scenes.  Your ability to remain calm, focused, and take immediate action is invaluable.  It brings a sense of relief knowing that your on the team and always ready to do your part and more.  Thank you for all you do, and all you did!\n\n17#Resources Ninja!|Matty, thank you so much for your quick work when I asked if you could help us create an Uberflip stream for a customer communication! This content will be invaluable for our customers as they navigate through this next phase of work. I'm so happy we could curate this quickly and offer it up to this group. Helps us continue to be seen as a thought leader and an advocate for our valued customers. Very much appreciate the support!\n\n18#Fierce commitment to urgency|\"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there IS such a thing as being too late. This is not time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.\" - MLK JR.   Team, since I started just over a month ago, I have heard from many of you and our stakeholders who have talked about the misfortune of joining Workhuman during a global pandemic that has changed every thing about how we live: from how we interact, to what we spend our time and money on, what we value, and how we work.  The truth is, there was no better time for me to be able to witness the magic that is Workhuman. We already know what is important and that is human connection. What you have demonstrated is humanity during a time of extreme urgency - a rarity in life and certainly in business. Thank you for your passion for your and your commitment to each other and our stakeholders.  I am honored to work alongside each of you.\n\n19#Moodtracker Launch success!|Team – Thank you for delivering our brand new Moodtracker product. Thank you so much to everybody for the amazing work on the Moodtracker product. Hard to believe this was just an idea at the beginning of January. Since then a team has formed, the product designed, architected, built, tested, branded, communicated, marketed and launched. Whew. The speed at which the groups collaborated is a tribute to the sense of camaraderie and positivity we have at Workhuman. The energy, imagination has shone through in every way. This coupled with the determination to deliver a world-class product means that today we have a sixth edition to our Workhuman Cloud suite. Welcome Moodtracker. On behalf of all of the humans in the company, thank you. Eric.\n\n20#Command Central|Thank you all for making yourselves available on the zoom call for the entire length of the WHL Stream event. Having all of us connected was instrumental in our ability to respond quickly and swiftly when we were met with unseeable adversity. We were able to give real time analytics, statistics, and updates on communications throughout the course of the event. Once things settled down we were even able to share a laugh or too (I think you smiled at least once, right Matt?). In a time where we couldn’t be huddled together in the same room, it really didn’t feel like we were all that apart.\n\n21#Strike Team Web Rides Again!|What an amazing couple of weeks for this team! On top of a huge technical challenge for Workhuman Livestream you created multiple new websites and updates to support the Moodtracker launch and Workhuman Livestream post-event strategy. Jon, not sure how you pulled off building so much high quality web content (although judging by the amount of late night/weekend discussions we had I have a guess!) Geoff, great work pulling together multiple unique homepage updates on top of multiple demos, critical to driving the business. Nick, as always you guide what we do from an SEO perspective, but your role doesn’t end there. You provide sound strategy as well as eagle eyes when it comes to QA (not sure how we all missed the report on that phone image!) Finally Matt, you lead this motley band of web warriors on successful launch after successful launch, and you’ve been on top of your game for countless weeks without missing a beat. Great work everyone!\n\n22#43 slacks in 19 minutes - that's some data|Yes, that's what you did together. Members of the whl-stream-tech channel - between 1:00 and 1:19 you urgently yet calmly worked together to troubleshoot, problem solve, implement, and communicate a workaround. I was watching you. You saved the day because you worked together and responded decisively. Sweat and tears, and a whole lot of teamwork.  Not to imply there were not many backup plans and scenarios discussed in advance because there was no shortage of that. But when the moment came, decisions needed to be made, action needed to be taken... and you did all that. Kudos.\n\n23#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n24#Web team warriors|Thank you for continuing to be the most awesome web team ever....We're seven weeks into this WFH journey and I remain in awe of each of you for your consistent level of engagement, creativity and quality of work - even when things are being thrown at you left and right and needed in a heartbeat. I am grateful for you and enjoy the connections we have formed with each other. As each day passes, i can feel them strengthening and that is a very good thing.\n\n25#Fantastic Playbook Development Workshop|Thank you all so much for taking big chunks of your time over the last two days to participate in the playbook development workshop. We are tackling all of the important pieces as we continue to redesign Workhuman's demand generation and account based marketing, ensuring that we're focused on the right future customers, delivering the most important messages at each stage of the journey, and arming our teams with the right training and tools to develop more opportunities and win more deals. The experience, energy, enthusiasm, and creative thinking over the last two days was phenomenal; and I can't wait to bring it to life in the new playbook. I'm very grateful for the outstanding collaboration and commitment to sales and marketing alignment!\n\n26#Questions & Answers = Crushing it|The questions were: \"Are you there?\" \"You working?\" \"Can you come inside on this beautiful Sunday?\" The answers from this group were \"Yes!\" \"How can I help?\" \"Be right there!\"  Thank your dedication, time out of your weekend (or your whole weekend), and flexibility. For answering your phone, responding to texts, jumping on calls, endless Slacks, and using Workfront ;-)  Multiple communication channels are needed to launch a promotional campaign in 4 days, over a weekend, while working remotely. I am proud of you, to be a part of this team, and for what we accomplished together. Thank you.\n\n27#Livestream Launch!|I was going to find an image of a nice stream for this recognition, but the way this team came together and launched – with immediate results (more on that below) – a rocket made more sense.  We have been in a hurry up and wait, start and stop process on bringing a digital/live stream event to market for a bit now.  In the past few weeks it all started to come together, and this past weekend it all really came together.  Our band of weekend warriors once again rallied to pull everything into place and then dragged many more souls into the battle for a rapid Monday launch.  With Dianne at the helm providing impeccable project management and, might I say, a few beatings we were all kept on task.  Jen, Chris, Kevin, and Jay – you were right there every step of the way on design iterations and animations.  Owen, you’ve been a master of the nuanced wordsmithing we’ve needed on this.  Matt, Biz, Geoff and Mark – you built, staged, tested, and launched all new site pages and elements in almost no time at all.  Your work set-up for a great launch – where we dragged in Anthony to build, test, and deploy our emails with about an hours time from asset to release.  Rob and Roshni jumped in to iterate social/digital and bring us live globally.  Colleen, Anne and Jess pulled the enablement tools and comms together and put them in everyone’s hands to help us all share and promote the program.  Mike and Lauren working the external networks to amplify and extend reach.  And Jill.  Maintaining a calm presence, helping align priorities and strategy, and ensuring we’re on track for the overall business goal.  We’re really just a the start of a 3-week journey.  Much work is yet to be done, but you put us in the best possible place to succeed.  So much so, that within hours of launching, we already over 1000 registrants.  Impressive!  I so enjoy working with this team and knowing that together – we can and will deliver!\n\n28#Running apart - So we can run together|Workhuman runners club! ... 'Sup?!  Thank you for keeping together the community that running offers us. Even though we have to run solo these days, and even wear masks (ya, you try doing that) when running, you've kept me resilient in something that is of great importance to me (even greater now) and brings me strength and mindfulness when I need it most. I appreciate the creativity and camaraderie the \"virtual\" challenges we have concocted bring us.  Though I am never at risk of \"winning\" these, the shear knowledge of knowing we're out there \"apart\" but \"together\" is heartening. Keep running, as we still have \"miles to go\"! With gratitude, -C\n\n29#Are you there?|Yea you were! Thank you, Matt, for joining a website meeting with negative notice. You jumped on the call, read a few notes and contributed to the conversation to support your team. Way to lead and be a teammate. I appreciate your dedication.\n\n30#Thank You Healthcare Images - Weekend Worriors|Thank you all for jumping in to take part in the logo and image sourcing and uploading for hospitals into the Thank You Healthcare site!  Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring! Thank you also to each of you who dedicated an hour, several hours and in some cases most of the weekend to sourcing and uploading!  We so appreciate your efforts!  Many hands make light work, my mother used to say! I do want to call out a few of you who really made an incredible dent in the project uploading and sourcing between 70 and 230 images each and in many cases hitting both uploading and sourcing!  WOW!  Brian Moore, Matt Durgin, John Wamback, Jon Bizeur, Amanda Salvas, Rich Sorrentino, Jillian Gregoriou and Dan Fiore, you guys are complete rock stars and your contributions were mammoth! This was a true team effort and to see it in action makes me so proud to be a part of our Workhuman family!  Amazing job! Let’s share some gratitude with the world now!\n\n31#Leading by example|Matt - Thank you for continuing to keep your teams wellbeing at top of mind and calling out when someone took advantage of an opportunity to spend time with their family. It’s so important to  make sure your team is balancing work and life. Keep it up!\n\n32#Engage warp factor.....10|I Wanted to take a moment to show some gratitude for my amazing team. I am constantly impressed with the teams ability to respond to digital challenges and new initiatives with a sense of urgency and agility. The past couple weeks have been fast paced with changes to the website and our resources section.  Even moving at light speed everyone makes it a point to embrace all ideas and perspectives as well as support each other. With that type of collaboration and cohesiveness great things are able to be accomplished. Congrats on the launch this week!  It is a pleasure working with you all. In the words of a famous starship captain \"Things are only impossible until they're not\" ― Jean-Luc Picard\n\n33#We're putting the band back together|As a former web-guy I can’t express how much I’ve enjoyed working with this team again on a daily basis throughout the past two weeks. In many ways it's felt like a reunion with multiple iterations of the Workhuman Web Team working together once again!   Jon and Geoff, it’s been incredible watching the progress you’ve made on all of our web properties. You’ve been raising the bar not by the day or even the hour, but often by the minute, responding to the current need with an agile thinking and execution (sorry, I had to say it!).   Nick, you’ve quickly become a north star for strategic thinking on this team. Your thoughtful approach to every challenge, and ability to take the lead, especially on our resources page is beyond impressive.   And finally, Matt, it’s been an absolute pleasure getting the chance work with you again in a rapid development situation. It’s amazing how much our two man web operation, once focused on developing new websites has transformed into a fully-fledged digital strategy powerhouse.  I’m truly excited to see how the evolution we’re seeing on all of our digital properties continues in the coming year. There is a desire beyond the current situation with Covid-19 for relevant content that works in synergy with all of marketing’s campaigns and beyond. Keep up this amazing work!\n\n34#8:45am - sunshine and smiles!|This week has been an amazing opportunity for us three to connect on a level like never before. Every morning, 8:45am, I'm greeted with sunshine and smiles from you both. Me eating my cereal, us talking about the night before and the day ahead, I've loved our banter, our camaraderie, and our candor. Together, we are a great team and by the floods of recognition for your team members, your leadership is speaking louder than words. I'm incredibly proud of you both. Hope you have an incredible weekend and I'll see you bright and early on Monday 8:45am!\n\n35#Hidden Talents|We all have been working hard on some face paced projects that have had some real impact - it has been a whirlwind few weeks! One of my favorite parts about this group dynamic is that we aren’t afraid to offer up new ideas and try new ways of thinking. Everyday we learn about hidden skills that each one of us can summon to help the team move even faster and make the projects run smoother. Whether or not our suggestions make it to the final iteration is irrelevant - we are all working to achieve the same goal and support and help each other immensely along the way.  We call our daily chat a “safe space” and I genuinely believe it is. We aren't afraid to challenge each other, laugh, and grow together. It is an honor to work with a group of such talented (and hidden talented) people such as yourselves. This team is a powerhouse and I’m excited for what comes next!\n\n36#triple threat|This recognition is seriously overdue so I'm SHOUTING FROM THE ROOFTOPS (social distancing approved) how thankful I am for you Matt.  You're an anomaly;  a triple threat if you will.  Strategy.  Technology.  Execution.  Very few leaders can master all 3 skills; but not you my friend.  You look at a challenge from 360°, understand the role of technology and move forward with purpose.  I'm consistently in awe of your ability to take on a project from start to finish so thoughtfully - even as a new PAWRENT!  I have so much respect for your work ethic and want you to know how appreciative I am of YOU (bold, italics, underline!).\n\n37#It was a moment!|A huge and sincere T H A N K Y O U to this long list of amazing humans. It seems like an eternity but just a short few weeks ago at the Executive off-site down in Florida, Eric and his team were all seated for a session. Each person was handed a sealed envelope with their name on it. Inside were the private letters each of you wrote. Some vulnerable, some filled with humor but all filled with how that person made you feel. It was a moment! Silence, smiles and even tears. It's not every day you get the chance to silence an entire Executive Team and remind them of how much they also matter and how they have influenced your day, week - or career. Thank you for being at the heart of what made this moment come to life.You all are amazing!  -Rebecca & Alice\n\n38#What a Year This Week has Been|Brian, Matt, and Z -  *exhales* ok so that was a whirlwind. We hit the ground running at about 100 MPH this week and didn't (at the time of me writing this, we still haven't) stop once. Our team kept pushing forward and we turned around an incredible product. None of that would have been possible without the three of you. You all formed a cohesive management team that not only kept us updated and on track, but you all went to bat for us too and that means so much. A lot of what happens on the backend goes unseen so to have you all as voices for the team was instrumental in pushing Phase 1 across the finish line (and presumably Phase 2 by the time you read this). Looking at this week as the most stressful of stress tests, I know that we have a kick ass team that is going to crush any project that comes our way.\n\n39#More like: Page Under Reinvention!|Team - Incredible lift today to align our core website property with burning platform initiatives. We now are in position to drive all humans to an ever-evolving, ever-improving web platform. This creates immediate value today and will continue to pay dividends as we drive more traffic from more initiatives to Workhuman.com. Thank you for mobilizing asap and driving significant improvements in the past 24 hours. Well done and great demonstration of the behaviors and teamwork we need to harness this moment for the company and our customers. With gratitude, -C\n\n40#Is this what Brian means by agile?|Wanted to give a quick shout out to this team for all the great thinking and ACTION around updating our site to respond to the current times. The sense of urgency is super high, the direction keeps changing, we're all remote and trying to keep up and learn how best to work together but you guys continue to amaze me with your responsiveness, resourcefulness and flexibility. I hope this is the first of many collaborations we'll have together! I am beyond grateful for your partnership, creativity and commitment to getting sh*t done! Thank you!!\n\n41#Team Corona|Coronavirus.  Covid-19.  A giant headache.  We all call it something different – especially because the situation with it has been changing minute by minute and making our decision making process so challenging.  When we made the decision to create new content and FAQ’s for our Workhuman Live site and audiences at 8PM on a Friday night, I crossed my fingers we would be able to activate.  We needed to get information out to our audiences that was clear, consistent, and valuable to ensure they felt informed and at ease.  No surprise – every single one of you stepped up.  Dianne was slacking me almost immediately with project set-up details and timelines.  Lauren had copy in my hands before 6:00 AM (you actually sent it at 1:30!?!)  Chris and Amy were both there to review, edit and get on the phone to talk it through.  Jon had site pages staged and new pop-up functionality built and staged Saturday morning.  Jen and Anthony had layouts and content ready to deploy.  Jill was providing copy strategy and reviews.  Holly and Anne were standing by ready to act as needed for our audiences.  And Lauren – our guiding light and champion of strategy supporting the whole process was as responsive as ever with reviews and feedback.  This is such an evolving and fluid situation, but the team never ceases to amaze me.  You gave up family and weekend time to help ensure our customers had the information they needed, when they needed it.  Your continued dedication and respect for customers, urgency, quality, and teamwork is amazing.  Thank you – and Cheers to Team Corona.\n\n42#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n43#Shoutout to all my Saucy Aunts|Thank you all so much for bringing great energy, enthusiasm, and attention to the kickoff with Influitive! This was a true cross-functional effort with representation from CX, CS, Strategy and Consulting, Marketing, Sales Operations, and Design – an awesome demonstration of the power of collaboration. As we heard, even our Influitive consultant was impressed with how much involvement we had. You all brought unique perspectives on how we can engage with and deliver value to our customers through this community platform. I’m still riding the wave of excitement coming from our kickoff and am so excited to engage with each of you further in executing on the strategy we developed together. And not only were we productive, but we got to have some fun in there too ?. I’m so grateful to work alongside each and every one of you. Looking forward to the amazing things to come!\n\n44#Sprinkling the Urgency on Sprinklr|A huge thanks to this group for their collective effort to get the Sprinklr contract properly vetted, negotiated, and signed on time to secure maximum discount on the last day of their fiscal year. It was one of our largest marketing tech purchases in recent times and we wanted to get it done properly. The future of social management and listening is bright thanks to your contributions!\n\n45#Team 12: Brainstormin' with the BEST!|I want to thank you all for such a successful brainstorm session at Ignite! It was great having people from different teams come together to share ideas. First, it was nice to be in a smaller group of humans and get to meet some new friends. And it was so fun hearing about everyone's first job - we even had a nautical theme among the group. Then we dove into the brainstorm piece and the ideas were flowing. Everyone gets an A+ for participation, too! It is not always easy to share with people you just met, but this was not a challenge at all. Thanks for letting me brainstorm with the best!\n\n46#Project Bow Tie|Pam, Jill and Matt, I just wanted to call out the wonderful job you are doing with Project Bow Tie.  Reimagining our demand generation function is daunting.  But you managed Phase 1 so smoothly and we're starting to build some real momentum now.  Not only have you navigated through those ideal customer elements seamlessly, but you have kept all stakeholders well involved, informed and excited.  This type of innovation that brings together cross-functional teams and gets them all pulling in the same direction is a great example for how we will all have to act in the coming years to continue the company's growth and innovation.  We still have a long way to go but well done so far!\n\n47#What is thy bidding|Matt, can't thank you enough for everything. Ever since taking over at the helm of the Ops team, you've been a crucial part of everything to all members of the team. To me specifically, you've been an awesome mentor, helping and guiding me through the ways of new vendor procurement and strategy with them once onboarded. You've always empowered me and gave me the confidence to keep pushing into this type of work and that is something I am immensely grateful for. Working with you is always a breeze and the way you lead this team can't be understated. You are a phenomenal human and I know you and this team will continue to crush it!\n\n48#The foot that holds up the Leaning Tower of Pisa|Anthony and Matt, over the past few weeks, I've come to you with many projects for WHCT.  We've had landing pages, email sends, ad campaigns, and general set-up questions.  Every time I have a request for you, you're answer is always \"Yes! I can help.\"  It's that positive attitude that makes it a pleasure to work with you. And, for this award, I'm grateful for all the input and best-practices you provide to the team.  You've become valuable resources for us as we build out our small business product. Thank you for your dedication to ensuring we're successful.\n\n49#2019 Year in Review|I was just completing a review of our SEO/web efforts in 2019, and I am happy to report that we made incredible strides this past year. You all made those strides happen.   Jon/Geoff, you two are the unsung heroes of our marketing organization. Since I started in May, we have undertaken several, significant, web overhauls, and the two of you saw them through flawlessly. Also, thank you for letting me bother you with all my edits to the sites.   Brian, the Workhuman Live website redesign went incredibly well and that is due to your oversight. The action plan you created kept the whole team on track. All deadlines were hit (that were in our control), and for such a large team, that's a huge success.   Sarah, thank you so much for being so open to the SEO process. The content you and your team have created is already paying dividends for us in rankings and traffic, and I know we're going to see more growth in 2020.   Matt, I don't have enough space here to thank you for everything. You gave me the runway to hit the ground running, and you were a great advocate for me in so many ways. There were several projects that you jumped in on to help out which is very much appreciated.   Here's to an even more successful 2020.\n\n50#Exhibiting the best human qualities|Anthony and Matt, over the past several weeks, the WHCT team has come to you with many requests for new ads, landing pages, and code updates. And your response every time is, \"YES!\" I'm so grateful for your positive attitude towards these requests, which I'll admit may seem mundane, repetitive, and lack reciprocation. However, you never let that bother you. You respond to these requests quickly.  Your speed and dedication allow us to implement changes on-the-fly.  Thank you for your can-do, get-stuff-done attitude.\n\n51#RecognizeThis! Overhauled|Matt, you were instrumental in getting the RecognizeThis! blog edited for our resource center. From your backing of Geoff to helping me edit (literally) hundreds of posts, you dove in to help when you didn't need to. Our SEO score is rebounding much quicker than anticipated because of your help on this.   Thank you!\n\n52#Up for the challenge|Matt- a big shout out to you as we partner together to work on templatizing demand gen emails and landing pages with LeadMD. You helped me craft better emails to the vendor since I don’t have my Marketo lingo down. You worked with us on the budget to allow for more time we discovered we needed with all the rounds of testing and revisions. You’re on top of the communications which are key at this point. Thank you, as you have been a great support to me and the team throughout this process.\n\n53#Long Overdue|Matt, this recognition is long overdue. Ever since taking over at the helm of the Ops team you've been an integral part to the growth of our whole team. Personally, you've helped me to start delving in to the world of new vendors technologies and even our own existing ones that can always be improved. On top of that you've been an awesome ear to bounce ideas and strategy off of with all these platforms and anything else that comes up. And those both don't even begin to scratch the surface of everything you do! I know I speak for the whole team when I say THANK YOU for everything you do!\n\n54#PoliteMail|Matt, I cannot thank you enough for your help leading the charge in brining PoliteMail to reality. I am no lying when I say this is something that has been slowly in the works for years. However, you got involved and within months we went from zero to 99. We're almost there and I have you to thank. This tool is going to be a great resource for the internal comms team, allowing us to see how people engage with our messages. Thank you for your persistence with this project, steering it through every step of the process with your unflappable calm and confidence. I so appreciate you!\n\n55#Reverse Proxy Moxie!|This week we achieved our goal of adding the Uberflip hub to the Workhuman marketing site though a reverse proxy, very exciting! It will create a seamless experience for our users as they view our blogs and resource papers without leaving the site. I wanted to give a quick thanks to the team that helped achieve this. Des, after we ran into initial issues implementing a proxy though our site host you were able to implement a  proxy solution though our cloud front CDN. On top of that you always made time in between your other projects to answer questions, test and troubleshoot. Matt your relationships and in depth knowledge of Uberflip were essential. You made sure all the new code enhancements in the hub were ready to roll out and went though all the Uberflip launch checklists with me as we prepared to add our domain to their hub. Nick your SEO powers were very helpful in identifying and looking though all redirects and their potential impact on our SEO juice. Great job everyone! Super psyched to have this up!\n\n56#A Candid Round Table Discussion|On behalf of Jenn and myself, I'd like to thank you all so much for taking time out of a crazy Monday - let alone the last day of Q3 (!!) - to give us candid feedback about your experiences as intern hiring managers. Any form of feedback can be uncomfortable to give or receive, so we appreciate the time and care you took in sharing your successes this past summer and what you would like to see differently in the future.  Workhuman's Internship Program should not only be valuable to those who spend time with us throughout the summer or school year - it should be a valuable and positive experience for those who help to lead and mentor as well.  With your help, we hope to continuously improve the program for years to come - thank you!\n\n57#Modernizing demand gen|Jill, Pam, and Matt - I wanted to commend all of your work, passion, and focus around modernizing our demand gen strategy and approach. The three of you have worked diligently over the past couple of months building out the strategy and the how we do it at Workhuman. The meeting with Chris was a great one and it's exactly the type of partnership and future-oriented discussion needed. The marketing world has changed. We have an enormous opportunity to modernize our approach to move from an inquiry model to one that not only targets the right future customers but also drives new demand (and wins at a higher rates due to it being the right opportunity with the right level of investment).  Your efforts make it quite clear how much each of you care about our business opportunity ahead and continuing to elevate how marketing can partner with sales. Thank you!\n\n58#Thanks to you...|I reached out to each of you to pick your brains on the last major relaunch of our website, spearheaded by Matt and also the recent work led by Jeff on the current WH Live website. I want to learn from these past projects to inform how to best approach upcoming website work. You both took time out of your busy schedules, to comb through your old emails and files and share everything you thought would be helpful to me. Thank you for recognizing that leveraging your past experiences and unique perspectives will help me help US achieve our goals as we seek to improve the experience WH.com delivers in the future.\n\n59#A long overdue thank you!|This recognition is long overdue. In my first week you went out of your way to walk me through everything from dress code to the processes of the marketing department, and making sure I was absorbing as much as possible without being overwhelmed. In my second week you continued to make sure I was settling in well and had a good grasp on everything, sitting me down to discuss expectations and goals for my role. Now, at the end of my third week, I feel very comfortable and look forward to continuing to dive into various projects, tools, and responsibilities. Thank you for your approachability, encouragement, and for always making the time to meet with me!\n\n60#The quicker fixer uppers|You guys are amazing. There was a glitch on the website and you three rose to action, quickly taking care of the situation, custom coding a work around to fix an issue we are having with a third party vendor. You were action oriented, solution focused and kept me in the loop every step of the way. GREAT JOB!\n\n61#Making the Magic Happen|Matt, thank you for your support on figuring out how we can best tag, segment, and target a very specific audience for Workhuman Live.  After several round robin emails, you made the right decision to have a quick 1:1 meeting where we nailed it down and took the right actions – moving everything forward.  I appreciate your support on this.\n\n62#To Page 1 and Beyond|Matt and Nick - great job presenting at Monday's progress meeting regarding SEO strategy. It is such a key part of our future success. You were thoughtful with your approach and also how you communicated it to the larger team. We obviously have a huge opportunity ahead to impact sales and future growth for the company. But you have set the right foundation to build from - as we continue on the upward journey.\n\n63#First Architectural governance|Matt thank you for being the first person to go through the Governance process. This is a new relatively straightforward process and will have great benefit. You were incredibly quick to turn around the material and did a great job providing the info needed. Thank you for your partnership on this. Phil thank you for taking on the review without a seconds hesitation and getting us to a successful completion in under 2 days.\n\n64#Working through Workday edits like a pro|Thank you so much for jumping on some edits to a couple old Workday pages in our Resources center of our website. Brian, I came to you to ask how to swap out our integration partnership badges on the site and assumed you were going to direct me to Workfront and make me submit a project request that would get routed for approval and this would go into a queue behind a lot more elaborate projects. And I'd be lucky if it was handled by sometime next week. Nope! You jumped on it, asked me the right questions to understand the need and then immediately connected with Matt. Then Matt, you reached out to me within a minute \"Hey bud...\" It was such a joy to see your Slack message. You worked quickly to swap out the badges. Then while we were already in Uberflip, you also helped make some necessary copy edits. It all happened so quickly and so smoothly. So refreshing! Thank you both for your teamwork and sense of urgency. I really appreciate having teammates like you!\n\n65#B is for Bizzabo|When you are working with a new vendor using new software, and the main contact with that vendor is no longer involved... you need a Plan B. Thank you all for being part of Plan B for Bizzabo. You were ready, willing, able, nimble, and responsive in getting up to speed with the platform. You set up the program, tested it, connected it, troubleshooted, learned the ins and outs, developed copy and creative, and collectively tackled the Bizzabo beast!   Thank you for all of your time and attention in a very important step on the trail to San Antonio. The Workhuman Live 2020 reg site is open for bizzness because of your efforts - cheers!\n\n66#HIRED!|Matt - Congratulations on your newest hire!  I am so excited that Brendan will be joining your team.  Thank you so much for your dedicated partnership through the Marketing Automation Specialist search!  From a great kick-off meeting, to phone screens, to in-person interviews - you made yourself available and prioritized recruiting.  Your feedback and responses were so timely, which helps us ensure positive candidate experiences.  It was such a pleasure working with you on this one - thanks so much, Matt!\n\n67#Efficient and Effective|Matt - on behalf of Lauren and myself, thank you so much for your quick approval on an offer today.  While you were out of the office traveling, you still made the effort to check over and approve this offer so that we can present and send it out to the candidate before the weekend!  Providing a timely responses is just another reason as to how we make our candidate experience rock - thank you!!\n\n68#Successful Kickoff|Matt - thank you so much for taking the time to walk me through your newest Marketing Automations Specialist opportunity on your team (especially on the Monday after a holiday)!  I have never recruited for a role like this, so I appreciate you walking me through the ideal candidate and their main responsibilities.  Also, thank you for diving into my LinkedIn search with me to help set me up for success!  I feel great about the movement we are already making.  Thanks so much for your time and efforts!\n\n69#The Best Demand Gen Partners!|Matt and Jill, The last few months, we've spent a lot of time together talking about how to modernize demand generation at Workhuman, and developing a new, best-in-class framework that will drive growth for our business. These conversations have been simply awesome for so many reasons but mostly because of our partnership. We listen to each other, challenge each other, respect each other, and make each other laugh :); and the result is a smart, strategic proposal that we are proud of and excited about.  I love that we leave these meetings fired up and always say how much we love these discussions! I know this is early days of the journey, and I'm grateful to be working with you from start to finish on this. Thank you for being the best demand gen partners!\n\n70#In need a new technology|Matt, thank you for your quick response to my request to use an iPhone X.  I am creating a new video our our Conversations mobile demo and the app looks and performs best on the latest technology.  When I reached out to #GlobalMarketing and saw your immediate response, I knew I was in good hands.  Your willingness to share your resources and come to the aid of team member is unparalleled.  Thank you for your help with this project.\n\n71#Agenda at a Glance|Or, agenda in a moment.  Thanks all for coming up with a great overview of the important projects happening in Marketing, with just a little notice.  It was not only great to hear about the wonderful work happening in Marketing, but to see you all present it all so beautifully.  I am grateful for the talented team of colleagues we have at the helm and in support of all of these initiatives.  Thank you!\n\n72#What a Brainstorm|There’s nothing like a three-hour meeting, sandwiched between the company meeting, a marketing vp meeting, and countless other commitments.  Yet, every one of you came with your A-Game – ready to brainstorm a whole new approach to the Workhuman Live website experience.  Thank you all for showing up focused, open-minded, and collectively in alignment on exceeding our audiences’ expectations through the site.  Reimagining a website is never easy, especially when trying to set aside what we already know to try new things.  Every one of you stepped up to share your areas of expertise and add value into the overall plan.  Your input was so valuable and is helping to frame out an exceptional site plan for 2020.\n\n73#You are on an incredible journey|I am so inspired with how you've taken your new role to the next level. In the many years since you've joined, I've never seen you so engaged, so excited, so passionate, and so positive. You are exactly where you're supposed to be. It's my genuine pleasure to support you on your path to what, I am sure, are many great successes. You are a great role model and a great leader. Well done!\n\n74#Let's talk data!|Thank you all for participating in this morning's data think tank (especially on a Friday before the long weekend!). This was an important first step in working collaboratively to unlock the power of the data each of us collect with our teams across Marketing. I was truly inspired by all of your ideas and perspectives, and there is so much potential for us to use these analytics to take the right actions to bring everything we do for Workhuman to the next level!\n\n75#Thank you for the time|Matt - Thank you so much for your time today.  I know you are very busy (especially in the afternoon prior to a long weekend).   I am excited to support you in shaping the future of operations.  The first of many meetings.  Bear with me I while I get up to speed on all things Workhuman.  Thank you for your patience and guidance.\n\n76#Optimized from the Start|In my first two weeks here, I was able to do more of my actual job than I have been in the first two weeks at previous companies and that is because of Matt. Matt let me hit the ground running by giving me all the tools I needed. He also answered the hundred (probably more) or so questions I asked him about the company, competitors, and previous work done in the SEO space. Based on the first couple weeks, I can tell that working with him is going to be a great, cooperative experience, and I am very excited for what comes next.\n\n77#Minimally Viable Presentation|MVP TEAM! WOW! What an amazing feat pulling together one of the best narratives we ever had presented at the ELT meeting today! The information flowed, they were wowed, they laughed, it showed our strengths and highlighted our successes. You ALL were integral to making this come to life, especially during the last minute crunch hours (YAY BRUINS!!!) I was so honored to re-pre-sent all that Marketing has been working on what's to come. You are a fantastic group of humans, so grateful to work with you.\n\n78#The Master of Google Analytics|Matt, thank you so much for giving me a tutorial on Google Analytics! I had a baseline understanding but now I feel much more empowered to dig in. I also appreciate the extra time you took to help me with the WH follow-up reporting using GA. The insights that we received were super informative and will help us determine how to better structure the communications with attendees moving forward. You could easily have pulled all of this good data on your own and sent it to me, but I appreciate you walking me through the process and providing tips on what to look out for, and insights into what the data means based on averages etc. Thank you!!\n\n79#HIRED!!|Matt - first, CONGRATS on your new hire, Nick! I'm so excited about this hire - I think he's going to be a fantastic culture add and will contribute so much to the team. But really, I want to thank you for your awesome partnership on this search. You were patient when the pipeline was slow, you were super responsive when I had profiles to share with you or decisions that needed to be made. And on top of all of this, you NEVER complained when I sent you ENDLESS interview requests to meet candidates for OTHER roles while you patiently waited and trusted that I was putting in the work to try to bring in people for your opening. It is also very rare that we find a hiring manager who is willing to be flexible and consider someone with LESS experience than was originally proposed. Your flexibility on this really gave me the chance to open up my search parameters, widened the candidate pool, and essentially led to me finding Nick. Thank you so much for being such a great recruiting partner! I hope we get to work on more searches together in the future!\n\n80#Persona Workshop Warriors Unite!|I have such a grateful heart for this day, this entire team of Marketing mavens, and all the opportunities that sit within our reach. I have never felt more connected to our team than I do at this very moment. We just completed an all hands, all day persona workshop! Woohoo!!! Thank you for your investment. Thank you for being a kind audience that stayed engaged. Thank you for asking thoughtful questions. Thank you for your humor and your patience. Thank you for being real. Thank you for embracing the 7 1/2 hour marathon persona training session we shared today with gusto and heart! I truly believe that we will be a better team, and we will produce better marketing because of the time we spent together today. I can’t wait to hear your feedback about the agenda, the learning modules, the wiki….ALL the things! I can’t wait to apply this first body of persona work to our marketing efforts. Let’s GOOOOOOO!\n\n81#Learning about our customers and future customers|Congratulations wiki quiz winners! Thank you for taking the time to explore the wiki and learn more about our HR audiences. Wiki, wiki, wiki!!!!!!\n\n82#A Launch for the Ages|We’ve completed quite a few website launches over the years, but none as complex as the launch of Workhuman.com as our new corporate site. With so many moving parts involving two major websites we needed to maintain absolute concentration while making sure every detail was accounted for…all from a makeshift headquarters in a Nashville hotel! Thanks to both of you the launch was a success, downtime was non-existent, and traffic normalized much faster than anticipated. Well done!\n\n83#\"App\" Help Desk|Just wanted to thank you all for your work at the App help desk. There were password resets, pin lookups, email corrections, and scheduling tutorials which would have been enough to keep you all busy. However, there were also, Mother's Room schedules, ancillary room schedules, directions, laptop issues, charging problems, and more than a few requests for a place to take a call. No matter what the request, you all went above and beyond to make sure all the attendees were able to get the most out of their experience. Thank you!\n\n84#GF -> WH|I am so grateful for all you did to launch the rebranded website. It took a long way to get there but wow, we all did it! The end result is clean, bright and engaging and one URL!! The words are crisp and the IA is looking great. There were so many parts and pieces that it would be like an Emmy speech (cue the bassoons dragging me off stage!) thanking each and every one of you but I am sure you all know how much you contributed to the success. A few highlights: Angela, being the mad trafficker she is, Matt D, behind the scenes supporting and guiding, Maggie, Lauren and Dan's killer copy skills, rocking the new messaging! Geoff, the midnight coder, always pushing to try to break the chains that are Connelly! Jay and Ty, your collaborative designs and dividing and conquering with a smile, and onsite Nashville, Anthony and Brian coding some last minute styles so pages looked great! Lastly, Brian's first big launch as a leader on the team and what a great job! Here's to many more.\n\n85#More web game than Spiderman|Team it has been an exciting past few months working though the changes, enhancements and additions to the Workhuman corporate website. Innovation, Imagination and Determination sum up the weekly sprints, days and nights of hard work that went into making it happen. Tyler, Jay and Jess your designs are full of life and energy. Between the rebrand and Workhuman for teams, so much great creative was produced  in a short amount of time. Dan and Lauren great work on creating and reviewing all the new content. Brian great work on managing the project and daily sprints as well as  jumping into code to work on Development. Matt thank you for working with us on the domain changes and redirects. Angela thank you for keeping things on schedule and organized in Workfront. Grateful for and proud of this team for what we have accomplished!\n\n86#Interview Heros|HUGE thank you to both of you for stepping in to cover interviews today. Matt - you swapped to a new time with very short notice, and Janna you got added to the schedule on top of your very busy day. You were both SO quick to say yes when I asked this favor of you, and I so appreciate it! Our internal juggling will still come across as a smooth interview process for our candidate, and I can't thank you enough for that!\n\n87#The NUMBERS|Thank you for not only all the work you have put into the marketing efforts for the event, but the analysis and reporting as well.  It has been disappointing to see the drop of the last few weeks, but at least we have good reporting and an ability to assess things for the future.  I am grateful to have you supporting our digital efforts.\n\n88#My superhero|Matt - today I was suddenly without a computer (left it in car wife took) and needed to publish the latest Workhuman Radio. I reached out to you, hoping that you would be there, and you were! Thanks for dropping everything to help me get that up and running. You are always willing to help. Thanks!\n\n89#Late Night Launch Crew|Thank you both for staying up late to help launch the updated corporate website and Resources site. You both played critical roles in ironing out any final bugs and getting everything set  before we \"hit the switch\", assuring the new site was up and ready to go for the first wave of Workhuman brand announcements early on Wednesday. Let's do it again soon!\n\n90#Becoming Workhuman - Phase I achievement unlocked!|Team, I hope each and every one of you has taken a moment this week to appreciate what you have achieved. With ZERO external support (except for a couple of contractors doing \"find and replace\" logo updates, but that doesn't count) in just 45 WORKING DAYS (no joke) we have rebranded this great company Workhuman. It was beautifully handled and flawlessly executed, and you should all be so proud of your leadership and contribution to this historic moment. There's lots more to do, of course, but we have tremendous momentum, are off to an impeccable start, and I know we will finish strong.  I am grateful to be part of such an impressive team! We are living proof of the power of \"making work more human\". Thank you for all of your amazing efforts to make this happen!\n\n91#Data, Dissection, and Discovery|Matt and Brian - I’ve been watching you guys in recent weeks and am continually impressed and amazed by your level of curiosity, dedication, and innovation for our Workhuman attendee acquisition. You are always looking for new ways to advance our acquisition program through investigation of data and learnings. And you bring that to the table to the team, which only drives more great ideas. You are incredible team players who have long done amazing work here.  There is no silver bullet when it comes to get an audience to Workhuman. It’s a lot of little things done right.  You guys have done so many of these and they’ve certainly added up. Great job.\n\n92#Bringing a special workhuman moment to life!|Thank you all for your critical involvement in creating and delivering Eric's 20-year award!  We had several key requirements that were unique to this award including ensuring the secret was kept until the precise moment of celebration at the gala dinner!  Your excitement, passion and dedication to this unique and meaningful project was a joy to witness!  Jen thank you for your \"yes and\" collaboration to inspire the concept of a timeline award for Eric, Dan thank you for setting up the site and giving access to our workhuman family, Brian M thank you for setting up the site and applying the branding, Alana thank you for deigning the award, Maureen thank you for your design, approval and logistics management, Angela thank you for keeping all the deliverables on track, Matt thank you for securing the vanity URL, Colleen thank you for managing all employee communications and most importantly making sure Eric never got an alert message!!!  Lauren and Regan thank you for helping to get the board contributions, Eileen thank you for helping to gather the client contributions, Kevin thank you for your help with the messaging and Ellen thank you for being great stakeholder.  Amanda - you worked on this project with the most amazing amount of passion and determination and were a master coordinator of all things related to this project!  No challenge to tough to solve and no request to much work!  Your attitude was truly remarkable, AMAZING work and dedication to result in a special and powerful moment!  Brian K - AMAZING dedication and hard work to load all the employee awards into the private location along with all the family, customer and board messages!  Thank you for respecting the request for privacy and finding a great solution for us!  This team was amazing, and this was the most fulfilling workhuman project to get to work on!  Thank you!!!  Mission accomplished!  A great workhuman moment came to life because of you! Thank you!\n\n93#A journey in the way back machine|My sincere, if belated, thanks for all that you were able to research and remember from our 20 year history to contribute to all the timelines we'll see presented next week at GFORCE20. Without the data and stories that you were able to put together, the Globoforce story wouldn't be presented with as much richness as it deserves. And my ask came at an inconvenient time over the holidays, so I'm double grateful for you making the time. Thank you!\n\n94#YOS Support|Matt, I would like to thank you for all your support with uploading multiple catalogs for Schneider's offline employees. I greatly appreciate your quick response to my request for help!\n\n95#Speaker Hustle!|Huge thanks to the WorkHuman team around the latest speaker announcements!  Lots and lots to do in a short period of time, but want to thank everyone for the great teamwork, hustle and attention to detail. We have a few more to go, but looking forward to collaborating with everyone to do all we can to move the needle!\n\n96#100% effort, 100% to goal!|Congrats on achieving the 20,000 inquiry goal for 2018 — a valuable and engaged universe of campaign respondents that will drive future value for Globoforce! What's more, over the past year we've worked together to become both smarter and more efficient in how we plan, execute and measure demand campaigns. The advent of Core campaigns for Recognition and Performance means we have a consistent presence using less team resources, the digital component is more thoughtful and effective and we are tuning up and optimizing wherever we can. 2019 is sure to be another big step up; thank you for the great work!\n\n97#Marketing Metrics and Analysis|I am certain that your insightful research and resulting recommendations have made a very positive impact on our audience acquisition efforts for WorkHuma19, and will allow us to spend our time and our budget more wisely.  Thank you for your enthusiasm and great ideas to help us reach goal!\n\n98#Working Human, Working Smart = Big Results!|Hey team, I wanted to acknowledge the great progress you have all made in just a few short weeks. From getting more data to better understanding registration sources and drivers, to launching an incredibly successful Cyber Monday campaign, it feels like every week the team gets savvier, more disciplined and more effective. You are a living demonstration of the power of \"working smart\" vs. just \"working hard\". I can't wait to see even more insights and intelligence as we continue to learn and optimize!\n\n99#Sharing your story|Globoinnovators - thank you for taking the time to answer my questions, and for sharing your GloboInnovation story. Your stories and comments on the process will serve as a wonderful example of what it's like to make the top 10, and to come out on top. Our hope is that your stories inspire others to submit in the Spring, and that we keep breaking company records on the number of submissions each year. Congratulations on your big win!\n\n100#Team Power|Just wanted to take a minute to recognize some team members who helped me out while I was running solo this week. Brian thanks for staying late Thanksgiving eve to wrap up loose ends before  heading out on vaca. Also for checking in with me on your vacation to see if I needed anything.  Thank you Matt for being available for any questions I had and  helping out on the blog posts. Lisa thank you for helping me keep track of projects and revisions as they were coming out of Design and into Dev and answering any questions I had. Also for working diligently with me during dev to ensure the best mobile layouts!\n\n101#Its take a village to pull off Cyber Monday!|WH Team!! Such good teamwork, hussle and creativity went into our Cyber Monday WorkHuman promotion. It literally took a village from design, web, ops, digital, third party, ops, content creation, registration and OH not to mention awesome leadership!!!! I'm thrilled with the results so far (over 100 registrants in a few days). Thanks so much to everyone involved who went the extra mile on this project, the results are a clear indicator of some good work and thoughtfulness. Let's get to the next milestone!!!!!!\n\n102#Partner in Crime!|Matt, I cannot thank you enough for the tremendous amount of support you have given the WH acquisition team. In the last few weeks, you have jumped in with SO much gusto to help us dig in and get the most of our efforts across all fronts, third parties, digital, website, the list goes on!  Your attention to detail and keen eye on the goals with a never fail \"get it done\" attitude has been exactly what we have needed.  Thrilled to be working with you on this project (and hopefully many more)!  you're the best!!!!\n\n103#GloboInnovation H2 2018 2nd Place|Congratulations on your 2nd place finish in this year's H2 GloboInnovation program with your entry of \"Employee Superpowers\". This was very well done, from the start of the presentation with the Deloitte quote to the example of trying to find a team to participate in GloboInnovation. It was a very well-constructed presentation. Any time we have an idea that leverages our secret sauce - our data - our attention is piqued. A few quotes from the judges: \"The team builder page was really nice,\" \"Adding tagging like LinkedIn was a great idea,\" \"this takes what we are doing in the performance area to the next level, adds a whole other dimension.\" What would have got you to #1 would have been if you had added in some natural language processing.  Thank you for participating and taking the extra time out of your busy schedule to work on this\n\n104#Part of the team|I wanted to take a minute after an exciting first couple weeks to say thanks to Angela , Brian and Matt.  Angela thanks for introducing me to this company and referring me for this position. My first week you were really helpful making sure I knew where I was going for meetings and taking a little time each morning to chat and make me feel comfortable when everything was new. Brian thanks for welcoming me to the team by getting me set up with my workspace, putting together a first day team lunch to meet everyone and checking in to see how onboarding was going all week.  Matt thanks for taking the time to be my onboarding buddy,  showing me around the office and getting me all the background information on the Globoforce website. Happy to be be here and already feel like part of team!\n\n105#Team Terminus|Matt - This is long overdue as an award to recognize how critical you've been to WorkHuman digital promotions lately. But specifically, I wanted to thank you for working with me to get the campaigns set up this week in Terminus. You pulled me into meetings with the vendor while you were getting up to speed and that was really helpful considering they've had some recent updates to the platform and services so it was good for me to re-learn the tool and to be able to sit with you and run through campaign set up. I learned there are now much easier ways to set up Tactics and campaigns that will save lots of time and make reporting on the back end easier as well. Thanks for being a great teammate and always willing to learn!\n\n106#So MANY bits!|Matt! This is really overdue... I just wanted to thank you for all the hard work over the past few months streamlining our digital marketing. Getting up to speed and understanding all of the many moving and changing parts is no easy feat. You have a calm, cool demeanor and are doing a great job juggling the priorities and keeping us all informed and on point. Well done you!\n\n107#My testimonial|A big thank you to everyone involved in getting the latest round of testimonials across the finish line. Kevin, you always take the time to review and ensure we’re putting our best foot forward – you provide valuable insight and feedback along the way. Shweta, you did a ton of follow up to secure approvals from our customers, ensuring they felt comfortable and were happy with the final product. Dan, you ensured the new assets were accessible across all of our channels and communicated to our Sales/Marketing teams. Matt F and Jay, I love the look of this latest round. Thank you for combining old footage with new footage, and for making us look good! Angela, thanks for stepping up to ensure this project moved forward in my absence. Matt D, you’ve done an incredible job with the resources page on workhuman.com – thanks for ensuring our testimonials are featured so beautifully. I feel very lucky to work with colleagues I can count on!\n\n108#Dashboard in a Dash|Matt - thanks so much for building the Resource Center dashboard. Your efforts will go a long way in helping our team speak with numbers. You took the time to meet with me, get an understanding of what we'd like to accomplish, and followed up with the Google Analytics configurations we requested. Through your efforts, we can quickly see KPI differences by media type, determining the audience engagement and conversion of blog posts, e-books, papers, podcasts, case studies, webinars, and videos. Not only are you highly skilled, but you approached this with a positive, let's-get-it-done attitude. You are a great teammate. Thank you.\n\n109#The final push aaaaaaaaaaand, we are live!|Matt, the Careers Page is better than I could have imagined and I have YOU to thank for that. You worked tirelessly to ensure our page was not just good, but amazing. We pushed through so many deadlines (or missed them in my case!), to-do lists, copy needs, photography issues, formatting changes, icon designs, more formatting changes, more copy - and so many other things to make our page really shine. We were only *one* small part of the website - but you never minimized or excluded Careers from the level of attention other, larger pages/sections received. I really enjoyed working together and I learned a ton from you on the whole web process and how a new website, truly, is built. Congratulations on an absolutely huge undertaking - you should be incredibly proud not only of the careers page, but the website itself. I am grateful to have had a true partner in this process and am beyond happy with our page. Thank you for everything!\n\n110#Fly Me to the Moon|WOW!!!  Everytime I work with our incredible Creative team, I think I have seen the best, but they always prove me wrong.  Over the past month, all of you have worked so diligently to create a first class experience for our finalist presentation for American Airlines.  Custom boarding passes to be handed out to the meeting attendees.  A 16 page glossy, Globoforce Way magazine for each attendee, which outlined our unique strengths that would satisfy American's needs.  A terric custom demo site, which was being edited up to the night before our presentation.  A beautiful microsite that was used in the pre-RFP phase and then repurposed as a follow-up to thank the American evaluation team.  I cannot thank you enough for all of your creativity, thoughtfulness, support and time.  You are truly the best team ever!\n\n111#Phase II Launch is a Go!|With the Phase II launch of Globoforce.com a success, I can't say enough about your many contributions to the new website. From the very beginning of this redesign you've been a champion for Globoforce, emphasizing the highest quality, keeping the team on schedule, and most importantly managing the relationship with the external agency (the biggest challenge of them all!) During the weeks leading up to the Phase II content launch you were at your best, working many nights and weekends to make sure the site met the high standards we expect at Globoforce. The phenomenal effort you put into this site, and everything you do often goes on behind the scenes, but as always makes a tremendous impact for our Marketing Team and the company as a whole. Great work!\n\n112#A focus on Conversations|While a number of important marketing initiatives have supported Conversations since launch, until recent weeks we haven't had the opportunity or the bandwidth to come together as a team with a cohesive plan to increase awareness, drive demand and better supports the sales and customer success teams. The plan we presented this week is a framework we can build on to better reach the market with a compelling message, and to communicate across marketing and with sales. The planning process got us moving and shines a light on where we need to focus. Thank you all for making the time to contribute with already very full schedules --  a special shout out to Eric B for shepherding the team to get this done!\n\n113#There Wouldn't be Content Without Web|Matt and Brian, Just want to give you both a quick shout out for being amazing partners to the content team. Matt - I come to you quite often (sometimes it seems daily!) for web requests, whether it's a new WorkHuman Radio episode or a request for an update to an asset in the resource center. You're always a pleasure to work with and quick to respond. Brian - you're my go-to for workhuman.com and you're always helpful in answering my many questions on posts, authors, formatting, etc. Just this morning you helped me fix a broken link for a colleague in customer success who wanted to share the post with a customer. Thank you both for your sense of urgency and teamwork in the countless requests and questions I've sent your way over the years!\n\n114#At a moments notice|Matt/Brian- Thank you so much for jumping on the link error for the Oracle microsite. It was needed asap as the conversation was happening in real time and the link was not working. Globoforce looks good because you 2 are behind the scenes. Kudos to you!\n\n115#Mindfulness Matters|While you are spreading your wings into bigger skies (CONGRATS!) you have already been incredible partners during the team transitions. You are thoughtful and caring managers, mindful of your humans and their growth potential. I've thoroughly enjoyed learning from you about each of my newest team members and I look forward to continuing to partner with you to make it at seamless as possible. You've done an incredible job and I hope to build off the solid foundations you already created.\n\n116#URL Hosting Wizard|Matt, thanks so much for your help with registering a URL for me recently. I would have been completely lost with the entire process, and when I reached out you gave great guidance and then took care of it for me in almost no time. The site is going live next week and having an easy-to-remember URL will help our team immensely when socializing it. Thanks again for your help!\n\n117#Bye SnapApp|Matt, thank you for taking the time to research and vet vendors that could better serve our marketing organization. I was so excited to see the potential of a new platform today that would allow us to do more interactive, engaging things for our audiences without the struggle and frustration that is SnapApp. Thanks for including me in the discussion, and I can't wait to see what we are able to do in the future!\n\n118#on call|Thanks for dropping what you were doing to answer a 'call for help' from a meeting room today. Your expertise was needed for an urgent request related to an upcoming SHRM presentation. The time you took to answer a few questions is much appreciated.\n\n119#Employee Experience report ready in record time|Thank you so much for coming together as a team to get the Employee Experience Index ready in time for SHRM. Angela, you spent hours on the phone with Fedex to figure out the most efficient and cost-effective way to print it. Dianne, you quickly mobilized a team, set up kick-off meetings to get the project completed in time. Anthony, Matt and Diane, thank you for your expertise and finding a solution to create a vanity URL on Marketo landing page. Lisa, thanks for your input and for joining the call at such short notice. Alana, thanks for making the slides look pretty. So many slides and so little time. Truly appreciate all your help. Jill, what can I say about you? You are a pleasure to work with. On top of every project, every single time. Thanks, everyone.\n\n120#GPTW Europe 2018!|Thanks to each of you for your help with the announcement of our placement on the Great Place to Work Europe list! From providing input on the employee communication, to sharing pictures from the event, getting the press release out and then on our website, posting on social media, and finally helping get the email out in the Dublin morning hours (while I slept), I'm thankful for the great partnership from everyone on this - all so in sync. Thank you!\n\n121#A Beautiful Mind|When we moved the WorkHuman Radio podcast off of the WordPress site, and onto the new Uberflip site, it created a duplicate of the podcast in the iTunes directory. Should be simple to fix, right? WRONG. Turns out, the old podcast was created with an Apple account almost 8 years ago. Worse, we couldn't get the login to turn it off. I thought we were stuck and I was wrong. You found a workaround within the code that was able to block iTunes from picking up the old feed. You spent so much time on a very frustrating problem, but were able to figure it out! Thank you for your hard work and innovative ideas. You are our John Nash!\n\n122#Action Plans in Action|WorkHuman generates a buzz that gives us an enormous opportunity to follow up with prospects and customers. Each of you went above and beyond to create the Action Plans and breakout session PDFs that were emailed today. Timing was extremely important as we needed to get these out this week for optimal impact. Lauren B and Aaron – thanks for your smart copy. Lauren C, Brian, and Matt – thanks for scrambling to get the session PDFs uploaded in a timely fashion. Amanda – thanks for your wonderful eye for design. Carrie – thanks for providing photos so quickly. Alice and Kevin – thanks for your input and edits. Anthony – thanks for your Marketo expertise to get the emails properly targeted. Jill – thanks for your sales communication. And Lauren C and Amanda – double thanks for scrambling to correct the multiple PDFs that had to be resized at the 11th hour. Crazy week, crazy day – excellent result. Thank you.\n\n123#bigger and better|The gratitude bar was HUGE!!!! And I don't just mean that we made it into a giant screen-tree this year. It was full of humans ALL the time, and people were raving about it. Our attendees were connecting with each other in ways that were so much deeper than the usual chat-over-event-breakfast – all because of the hard work of the people who were dreaming up how to uplevel from last year's experience, testing vertical screens, the mobile interface feed and the curated beautiful loops. Your contributions to the success of this activation cannot be undersold. This is the living, breathing product in the hands of prospects and helps them internalize their own experience of what social recognition can do. It was beautiful and meaningful and I can't thank you all enough for your work on this project!\n\n124#Bringing WHRI Wizardry to Senior Exec Customers!|In the first initiative of its kind in our industry, you helped the WorkHuman Analytics & Research Institute to bring together a session between leading human capital academics and our top HR executive customers.  Elevating the level of conversations we have with our customers is a company-wide goal.  Getting those executive level conversations  and influence points isn't easy.  And - a two hour long event that included Adam Grant and Shawn Achor was no easy feat to pull off during a WorkHuman that included so many tantalizing choices for those executives.  Thank you all for the parts you played - many of them last-minute!  From Kevin helping to open the door with Adam and Ethan, to Lynette and Rebecca being customer recruiting powerhouses, to Stacey and Pam helping with meeting logistics and making sure the group was taken care of, to Matt pushing a last-minute reminder in the WH app so we didn't lose any of these C-level HR execs, to Greg and Chris for working the room with me and making sure customers felt welcome and that we captured next steps with them.  I've heard tons of great feedback from customers on this session and I know this is the beginning of a successful multi-year initiative for Globoforce!  THANK YOU!!\n\n125#Early Birds|Thank you for getting up super early every morning last week before the attendees flooded into WorkHuman Central to reset the LinkedIn survey and rebuild all the charts with me. We could have never made this experience happen without you!\n\n126#WorkHuman Mobile App Help Desk Heroes|It was great working with both of you at the Help Desk at this year's WorkHuman. While our primary function is getting people online and active with the WorkHuman app, you both were ready and willing to jump in to help attendees with any problem, from reviving broken laptops, directing people to specific locations in WorkHuman central, accessing the onsite wireless, or even catching a cab to explore Austin. Great work!!!\n\n127#Masterful Matt!|Matt, somehow you have survived the past 2 weeks—not sure how! Many of you may be thinking of all the shifts at the Help Desk while in Austin, but no, that is just the small tip of a very big iceberg (although thank you for that-- you never left)! You led the development and launch of our WorkHuman app, including troubleshooting unexpected issues with our development partner, resulting in an incredible adoption rate and great experience for all. Then there was the launch of an entirely new website, a huge project in and of itself, but for us also included a new, better host, an entirely new content management engine for our resources center. All of those pieces required tight coordination with legal, marketing ops, our development team and multiple third-party resources. Wow. And at the same time you supported your team in daily updates to Workhuman.com, the launch of the Nashville site, demo sites and probably more than I know. All of these efforts put us on a new level to better deliver our message and reach our market. I look forward to working with you to build on this success! Thank you so much!\n\n128#WorkHuman.com All-Star Team|Thank you all for making WorkHuman.com a success all conference long! Over the course of 4 days we launched 5 separate versions of the site, each with up to date content showcasing the very best of WorkHuman. From our initial strategy meetings weeks ago to the launch of the 2019 Nashville announcement yesterday you have all been amazing teammates who have gone above and beyond to make sure WorkHuman.com and all of its content is a worthy extension of the WorkHuman brand. We're on to 2019!\n\n129#LinkedIn Magicians|Team- Tight turnaround is an understatement. Stats, surveys, graphics, data and the back and forth for literally days...days. I cannot begin to tell you how amazing you’ve all been. Thank you so much for the urgency around everything pertaining to this partnership. It’s going to be awesome!!!\n\n130#Not All Heroes Wear Capes|The week before WorkHuman is always crazy - but this week takes the cake. One of our activations was experiencing some serious technical difficulties, and all of you dropped what you were doing to jump in and make sure we could make it the best it could be. Matt - I can't thank you enough for sitting down with me all morning to design charts and graphs in excel and test their connectivity with PowerPoint. Mark - you came out of nowhere and saved the day with sharepoint magic and a new approach to the survey. Brian & Jen - when we realized our initial solution was a no-go, both of you were quick to offer new ideas and start testing so that we could find the best solution in the least amount of time. And Lee! You jumped up from what you were doing to help us figure out what was causing the disconnect between our local drafts and the live updates. I am SO thankful that we have such an amazing team that was able to take this and run so that our attendees (and our customer!) will have a good experience onsite next week in Austin. THANK YOU!!!!!! You're all amazing.\n\n131#Web Rockstars|Thank you both for your speedy responses with agenda changes to the website and app. There are still changes every day (or every hour) and you update those immediately. This is is a high traffic week and it's key to have the website/app as accurate as possible. You both work until about midnight every night to make it happen. Thank you, we're almost there!\n\n132#Getting everyone the info they need!|Thank you all for your help putting together the WorkHuman staff training material, and for delivering the sessions. It's great when there are many people on a team all contributing to the project - it makes a big lift like this, easy! I really appreciate your attention to the details and for helping make sure employees have all they need to know before traveling to Austin. Thank you!\n\n133#Late Night at the WH Help Desk|Matt! We’re literally in the middle of one of the busiest weeks of the year, especially for the marketing team, and when a customer ran into a snag getting their personal agenda set up with all of the awesome sessions that they plan to attend, you jumped right in with a work around idea. Not only did you get the customer all set up, but you did it in the wee hours, and left a very strategic customer even more excited to get to Austin than they were at the start. Thank you for so clearly demonstrating our culture through your work! Look forward to seeing you at WH!\n\n134#Careers Website! Soft launch - check!|Matt, thank you so much for your incredibly hard work to get the Careers website off the ground before WorkHuman! This was no small feat and I am grateful for your guidance, patience and expertise in this process. I've learned a lot and have really enjoyed working with you. It's exciting to see things come to life and I appreciate all the time, energy and effort you've put in to make sure our page, and every single page, on the new website looks fantastic. I'm excited the soft launch is ready to go and look forward to diving into our next (and final) iteration post WorkHuman!\n\n135#WH App|Matt - I just wanted to recognize all work you have put into the WH App. You've done it so quietly, in the background, without any drama that I'm not sure everyone knows the hours you spent on demos evaluating the choices, the contract process, making sure it could get in the iTunes store with Apple's new policies, loading it up with content and users, and then fixing a LinedIn bug that was discovered to make sure we can use our customer/sponsor's app along in conjunction with ours. Way to go, Matt!\n\n136#Thank you!|Matt, I am so impressed by how quickly you created the American Airlines and Allscripts microsites. You are extremely busy with many other projects and still managed to clone and change out a couple assets to have the site up and running within minutes. This speedy work is helpful so that we can get information in front of prospects quickly. Thank you!\n\n137#Crunch time x 10!|Matt, as you are racing to the finish line on a number of critical projects, I want to give you a shout out for pushing us as a team to up our digital marketing game in a big way. You have long championed our new website- to roll out soon- a huge undertaking to get us to a much better platform to reach our market. At the same time we are launching a new content management platform, and your team is also deeply involved in this little project we call WorkHuman. The WorkHuman app in development (an important part of the conference experience) and the daily demands for web content are another layer that alone would challenge any team. Thank you for the extraordinary effort, and for your leadership on all these fronts!\n\n138#Multiple Microsites|Matt/Kelli- Thank you so much for creating and delivering 5 custom microsites for the Canadian video mailers. Since this was my first experience with these, you sat with me and walked me through these providing documents for sales, 2 different options for sites and creative edits once finished. I appreciate the hand holding and looking forward to seeing the results from these:)\n\n139#In the midst of a storm|Anthony and Matt, great job putting the final touches on our customer communications for the March release notes.  You've been great partners for many years as we have refined our release notes process. For the March communications, you once again showed respect for urgency by quickly responding to my request to publish the notes and make some last minute edits.  And, you did all this in the midst of a massive storm. Thank you.\n\n140#Uberflipping AWESOME!|With a major website upgrade on the horizon and new tools needing to be stood up quickly this team came together to negotiate a contact no one anticipated would be so painful. You all jumped into action to get on calls, make endless contract revisions, and get creative when it came to negotiations. I can't thank you enough for your support. You're all Uberflipping AWESOME!\n\n141#Shouting from the rooftops!|Many thanks to this team for helping share the great news that our Dublin office was named to the 2018 Best Workplaces list in Ireland (for the sixth year in a row!), coming in number two on the list this year. It was a late night for all, and yet the news was shared quickly to the entire company and to the world. Kevin, thank you for getting the press release finalized. Matt, thank you for getting the release on Globoforce.com and for adding the new award logo in all the important places on our site. Mike, thanks for sharing the news and photos from the night on social media the night of the event. Kristen, thank you for creating signage for the TVs to be up during the Dublin breakfast celebration the next morning, and also in Framingham. Regan, thank you for helping us get the message from Eric out. And, a huge thanks to Christine and Aimee for being our on-the-ground correspondents, reporting in live via Slack, keeping us informed of all that was happening in Dublin at the Awards Ceremony. Such a great team effort by all. Thank you!\n\n142#A Subtle Superman|Matt, you may be sitting quietly in the corner of marketing, but you are launching some seriously huge projects for us. From a brand new website with new tools integrated within it to a new mobile app for WH, you are quietly orchestrating a revolution for our outward facing web properties. If your stressed, I can't tell! We're lucky to have you in these projects and leading the way for our team. Keep up the great work!\n\n143#Captain at the Helm of the Workhuman.com Launch|Matt - Thanks for jumping on line late tonight to support the launch of several WorkHuman.com updates, offering feedback when necessary, checking mobile, and above all keeping everyone in good spirits. Great to be part of this team...thank you!\n\n144#Leading the Web Team into 2018|I just wanted to take a moment to recognize your impressive leadership in all things web during the past few months. It's no secret how busy you've been with the Globoforce.com redesign and the dedication it takes to get a new and improved site ready for prime time, but despite that you've still been there ready to support the rest of the team in all of our web efforts. Whether it's WorkHuman.com and all of our preparation for the on-site experience, to managing microsites and custom demos, you're always there to bring great ideas and energy to the table. Thank you!\n\n145#The need for speed|Matt and Tyler - Last week and this week, I've come to you both for last minute changes to SHRM assets. Tyler, you changed an image and sent a new one before my finger even left the send button on slack. And Matt, you updated the web page with lightning speed. It's so awesome to work with such rockstars! Much appreciated.\n\n146#\"Whoever does your SEO is really good!\"|During a meeting with HP, our prospect told us - \"Tell whoever it is who does your SEO that it's very good!\"  Apparently, their global culture leader, while on her Facebook, was being followed by Brene Brown adds.  She just can't shake it!  I think that's great!  Thank you for having such a great impact on our brand awareness.  It's the best I've seen in our industry!\n\n147#The Closers!|Today was an important day for Workhuman.com with a big speaker announcement, but right before launch I had to leave for a not-so-fun date with the doctor. Both of you jumped in to close out some very important pages. Thank you both...lucky to have teammates like you!\n\n148#Forms!|Thanks for taking the time to sit down and properly test the new forms for the website before we launch these in the coming weeks. We've had our trouble getting them to display properly in the past so I'm glad we were able to get things working. I appreciate you troubleshooting the solution with me and finding a way to make these work. I always enjoy working on projects with you and having the ability to learn from your expertise. Thanks again!\n\n149#Executing for Executive Forum|Matt - thanks for your willingness to make final edits at a moments notice to complete the Executive Forum landing page in time for review by the marketing team and to share on our internal sales and marketing call on Monday. I appreciate you talking through the possible options regarding the requested edits. We now how a live site for Executives to register on and to receive information regarding this high-profile WorkHuman track. Thanks again for your efforts!\n\n150#Mayor of Webville|Matt, I need to take a moment to recognize the impact you've had supporting this team and our numerous web asks. We've know our corporate site is ready for a makeover and through many contracts, iterations, leadership questions, and competing priorities, you have calmly lead us all towards a strong and fast paced project plan to make the next version the best one yet. You've also balanced minor updates, security upgrades, and multiple demo and microsite asks efficiently with your team. The number of teams your Webville team supports is astounding and yet, you are leading in a calm effective and supportive way, respecting all of our competing priorities while still driving our web assets forward. Thank you for the work you put in to help us look great to the outside world!\n\n151#Remember that email from October?|Of course you do! You're so organized and I really appreciated you reaching out this morning to confirm that all was a go for the Boston Globe updates to globoforce.com. Thank you for remembering and for making all the updates on all the pages that we promote our awards, and for then taking the initiative to suggest a change to the news page as well. Much appreciated!\n\n152#Ready (Team) Player One|Thank you both so much for helping me this week; showing me the ropes, answering all my questions, and making me feel like part of the team! So excited to be working with you guys!\n\n153#Homepage-vFinal|Matt & AMC, Thank you both so much for keeping us on track and on schedule with the latest homepage revision. Matt, you did a great job managing our relationship with Davis, ensuring we met every deadline we could and corralling feedback from multiple sources so that all of our changes were captured in the final product. Anne Marie, you were amazing in securing meetings and managing many difficult schedules so that we could get this off the ground, and also in being our superstar of quality control. It's been a crazy few weeks, but I couldn't have asked for a better team to get this across the finish line. Thank you!!!\n\n154#Fast & Fantastic!|A shout out for a great team effort to create a new Globoforce.com home page experience in record time. You took on the goal of upping the quality of the experience on the site and the clarity of key messages and delivered from start to finish in less than 10 business days. This required lots of reshuffling of priorities at a very busy time, a quick exploration of the best path forward, an openness to new ideas and decisiveness to make it all happen fast. The end result is a great step forward and also brings new energy to ideas around a brand new GF site for next year. It is such a pleasure working with this team!\n\n155#WorkHuman App|Matt, I just wanted to thank you for all the work you are doing to make sure we find the right app for WorkHuman '18. The evolution of WH constantly requires us to look for a new and better way to do things and your research on apps capabilities will surely help the attendee experience in Austin.\n\n156#WorkHuman Launch Heroics|Matt - just wanted to thank you for the tremendous amount of work you've put in to get the new WorkHuman site successfully launched. You took the lead in managing the switchover to the new site, set up our SEO and tracking tools, made sure our content from years of WorkHuman events were safely archived, and jumped in wherever you could to fix bugs and update content. We couldn't have done this without you!\n\n157#amazing video for Accenture RFI|Jess and Matt - thank you so much for taking my vision for the Executive Summary and making it into a phenomenal visual experience for our prospect!  From the quality of the video to the heartfelt message you all used your expertise to show how and why Globoforce is the right partner for Accenture.  Our company has worked this account for 5 years and we know so much about them and all of that came across in this video.  What a great way to differentiate Globoforce right from the start.  Our team will continue to run with it and make all of our hard work worth it!\n\n158#\"Landing\" Homepage and Conversations Page Safely|Matt - incredible work in getting the new Globoforce homepage and Conversations landing page done and live in time for our announcement at HR Tech.  The timeline was super tight - and I'm sure stressful at every step along the way.  Thank you for your leadership and ushering it through.  It's remarkable how smooth the launch was - as you took the time to consider and test all forms to make sure the experience was a good one.  Thank you!\n\n159#Budget Partner|Matt, thank you for always supporting my budget needs. Whether it is following up with payment terms and allocation in contracts for budget planning or sending weekly receipts with POs, you have been a great partner to me. Your timeliness on my requests is always appreciated. Thank you!\n\n160#Real Life ACTION Hero!|THANK YOU, THANK YOU - our real life ACTION Hero!  From an urgent Skype, you dove right in and helped me solve a video issue so 29,000+ associates at OhioHealth could see and hear messages from Dave Blom, CEO, passionately show his emotions when talking about the importance of the new Inspire associate recognition program and it's key to their culture.  Move over Batman, Superman and every other man ... it's MATT MAN that reigns today!!! Thank you, Thank you!!!\n\n161#It's the Rockin' Web Masters Bringing It!!!|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Urgency!  You guys are the best dual-act web masters anyone could ask for!  Not only do you BRING IT, you bring it BIG.  Mastercard had an urgent request that came in without notice (of course).  I reached out to Matt for help with this, re:  Mastercard's Recognizing You portal, and received an out of office reply.  Lucky for me, Brian was listed as the go-to.  Without hesitation, Brian I hit you up for some urgent changes to this portal, adding a new recorded training session, then a series of program marketing assets, then text changes etc. All this effort was for Mastercard's HR Business Partners and Program Champions to immediately access these materials, get familiar with the new program, plan local launch day events and essentially, get super prepped for launch.  You joyful jumped in, took the set of requirements and turned around same day.  There was only 1 remaining change needed.  A critical piece.  Matt, from the middle of the Atlantic soaking in the blue skies and water, you chimed in and organized a plan to have all ready by morning.  Then upon getting on land, finished the task.  All while keeping me informed every step of the way.  This allowed me to be in constant communicate with Mastercard's internal communications team and \"ready\" the communication and hit the \"send\" button.  Masterful work!  You guys ROCK!!!  I loved working with the best band in the land on this.  If we worked in the same office, feels like I'd get sweet treats or free wings too, as part of this amazing experience!  Thank you!  Thank you!\n\n162#Dell Microsite|Matt, Thank you for your help setting up another microsite for our Dell meeting follow up. Once I submitted the request you had the site up and running in no time. Any time I had an update to the site you made the changes so quickly.  This microsite will be a great asset where Dell will be able to access important information and documents in a central location. Thank you for all of your help!\n\n163#A big thank you!!!|Guys, I want to thank both of you for your assistance on Friday. We needed an online logo that was purely for the new CCM system that will not move in location or change. You both worked to get this logo for me! Within 24 hours I have received the location of this logo! Amazing team work guys and another item of the CCM project task list! Thanks again. Enjoy!\n\n164#Microsites....Macro Impact|Matt - you've put so much time and effort in building out so many microsite this past month - always with a \"yep...we'll get it done\" response for each request. Not only do you get it done, but with a quality deliverable and a lot of patience when I come to you with edits. You've helped multiple sales reps reach out to prospects and provide them with collateral relative their business needs, each with a personal message. Your positive attitude to take on multiple projects always makes working with you such a pleasure. Thanks for being such a great partner on these microsites!\n\n165#Education|Hi Matt,  Just wanted to say thank you for taking the time last week to educate me on our websites and how they are supported and for facilitating a conversation with the external contractors. Great to know you have all the ducks lined up on this one.\n\n166#It Takes an Army|Thank you for putting a ton of time and energy into the ROI Calculator campaign. This campaign literally took an army of people to pull it together. It took research, training, integrations, and many design iterations to make it a successful campaign. I can't thank everyone on the ROI calculator team for going above and beyond to make this campaign happen. Now, it can be used in many different formats, outlets, and move deals along!\n\n167#These guys can CODE|Brian and Matt, I can't thank you both enough for all the help you have given me during WorkHuman and for follow-up. I decided I would name myself and honorary App Desk member in Phoenix as I was trying to build the Landing Page for Conversations. You had to listen to me rattle off movie quotes and lob over questions I had relating to the page I was building. You both were so patient and willing to help me out. I saw first hand how hard you both were working to get the Gratitude Bar files uploading as they were coming over in batches of thousands! You guys often heard, \"Brian, Matt can you take a look at this\" as I accidentally kept interrupting your concentration but never got frustrated. Just today you both jumped in and helped me solve the Marketo Tracking functionality on the session recordings for the WorkHuman attendees. I'm honored to have the opportunity to learn from you both and look forward to working with you guys again soon. Thanks for everything!\n\n168#Displaying Superhuman Powers|Stacey, Kelli and Matt,  I cannot thank you enough for the incredible work you put out for the Dell Technologies microsite. Stacey, your superhuman deed of coordinating the Screen Cast demo to be completed in just over one week was incredible!  Kelli & Matt, your display of superhuman speed and creativity made the microsite a work of art!  The team's creativity, agility and attention to detail made this last minute project a huge success!  Beth  P.S. If anyone is wondering who is who in the Powerpuff Girls - Stacey is Blossom; Kelly is Bubbles; and Matt is Buttercup\n\n169#Updating the website with press clips|Matt, thank you for updating the website with four months' of press coverage. I realize how busy you are with other website projects and getting WorkHuman content up on the website so  really appreciate you posting these ASAP.\n\n170#WH content at our fingertips|Matt and Brian, Thank you so much for all of the work you did to make our WorkHuman content easily accessible to our attendees. Matt, you worked our videographer to answer all of her questions (late, on a Friday, I might add) and made sure we had the videos in the format that we needed. Brian, you laid out the content beautifully and worked with me to make sure all of the speakers and session titles were correct and everything was working smoothly. You were both so patient with updates and changes as we got permission to use additional content. I’m so happy with the end result and thankful to have such wonderful teammates!\n\n171#Web Slingers|I can't thank both of you enough for the mountains of work that went into the onsite website and post show launch of Austin 2018. You seamlessly transitioned the website from homepage to homepage, managed and implemented new content types, graphic treatments, and phased over the site to a completely new look and feel. All this on top of MANUALLY entering every single moment of gratitude from our onsite recognition platform to the app so that all 3143 moments could be felt by every single attendee. I don't know how you did it all!!! You both are truly amazing and the complete definition of Globostars. THANK YOU!\n\n172#Mobile Momentum at WorkHuman|Matt and Brian - awesome work on site at WorkHuman.  You helped guide countless attendees toward usage and success on the app.  The mobile app was just phenomenal this year, connecting people like never before.  In addition, your help on the Gratitude Bar was a big part of its successful.  Congrats and thank you!\n\n173#Push Notifications|Matt- You are seriously amazing! Thank you so much for the last minute push notifications for the Executive forum attendees as well as you endless technology help! Your are a huge asset to the team and we couldn't do it without you:)\n\n174#Signs signs everywhere signs|Matt and Brian - thanks for putting out the fun run signs. You both have to go into a golf cart at night in the middle of the desert and put out the signs so that our runners wouldn't get lost. And Matt even got attacked by a stray dog! Thanks again guys.\n\n175#Best WorkHuman App Yet!|Matt - I'm sitting here before the event going through the app and I'm just amazed at how great this came out. From sourcing the vendors, to inputting the information, this was a months long project that you absolutely nailed. Just look at all the activity BEFORE the event even starts! Great work!\n\n176#Always Achieving Milestones!!!|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Urgency.  After 8+ years we're rolling out Milestone Anniversary Awards for Abbott in the US, PR and Ireland!  And the Comms to support this initiative will live on a website you built for the Excellence program and now is being leveraged for Milestone awards.  We hit you with two days of urgent requests to update text, add new categories, load numerous assets, then re-load after we realized a few file naming errors on our end, and you did it all with \"working on\", \"all set\", \"anything else\" type help!!!!  You're always so willing to leap right in even when these requests come out of the blue, are not pre-planned nor quick, easy things!!! This recognition also comes with your Milestone achievement of MVM title - Most Value Matt!!!\n\n177#Always There to Help|Matt, I've been coming to you with so many web requests these past few weeks (months, really) and every time I know I can count on you to deliver with a sense of urgency AND quality. I know I'm not the only one coming to you with requests, so I really appreciate your responsiveness! You have been instrumental in keeping the agenda and speaker pages on workhuman.com up to date so visitors are seeing accurate information. You're also a key piece of several WorkHuman follow up items we're working on - like the Call for Speakers and the re-certification credits landing page. You're juggling so much right now and I just want to thank you for being a great teammate even as we are days away from WorkHuman 2017!\n\n178#Awesome Awesome App!|Matt - fantastic work on this year's WorkHuman mobile app!  It looks and works amazing. And already, tons of people have downloaded it and are sharing their excitement on the social feedback.  There is a ton of behind the scenes work to making something like this work.  You have seamlessly managed the entire project and built everything that was needed.  There is no app for any HR conference that looks as good as this.  Great job!\n\n179#Building a Gratitude Bar|Such sincere appreciation for all of you jumping in and making the Gratitude Bar real! What started as a concept I was handed a month ago, has really taken shape as a real game changer for WorkHuman. I presented to Eric today what we have built and he loved it! Just one of his comments was about how this is very much the visions of what he has wanted since WorkHuman was first thought of a few years ago. Countless times all of you haven't stopped at \"that isn't the way it works\", instead pressed on to \"how can we make that happen. You all were so instrumental in the success of today. Just a little bit left to bring it home over the next week!.\n\n180#Hackathon Friday!|One of my favorite parts of working at Globoforce is the opportunity to collaborate with so many talented people in cross-functional teams. In the final stretch leading up to WorkHuman each of you rolled up your sleeves, offered suggestions and real-time feedback to help really tighten up three high priority development projects. It was an inspiring way to finish the week...thank you!\n\n181#Fontastic!|Just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to help set up the new fonts for the WorkHuman website's 2018 location announcement. In addition to revealing the new location we'll also be debuting an updated and refreshed branding. Having these fonts is a key component of this new vision, and it was a big help to have this ready to go as I set up the new web styles. Thanks!\n\n182#Snap-Appy Turnaround|Matt- thanks for jumping right in on the ROI calculator campaign project and spending time to develop the calculator in SnapApp. You turned the draft around in a day and have been there to help throughout the entire process. Your time and expertise is greatly appreciated! Thanks!\n\n183#Steering the Web Project Forward|Matt - Fantastic work today with our meeting with our web agency!  It was a productive hour - filled with great insights about our website and a strategy and attack plan.  Your behind the scenes work was huge - ensuring that the agency knew about our company, goals, messaging, and more.   And ensuring that the time today was efficient and covered all the necessary points we need to address. Thank you for your leadership and focus - I can't wait for the entire team to get started on the project.  It's going to be amazing!\n\n184#URL Solutions|Matt - Thank you for your help in procuring the last minute vanity URL for Master Lock. Their IT team wasn't able to get things working and when I came to you with this emergency request, you jumped on it. Within an hour we had the new vanity URL and Master Lock was on their way.  They were overjoyed with our level of customer service and urgency. Thank you again!\n\n185#M-Powering Our Customers!|Thank you, thank you, thank you for helping The Master Lock Company's IT team solve their challenges with the Vanity URL setup for their upcoming April 24 launch.  We have created beautiful communications and training pieces which contain the Vanity URL so that employees can quickly and easily access the new program.  When the customer experienced many challenges with the Vanity URL setup, all of the printed materials that contained this URL were at risk.  You were inventful and went above and beyond to create a solution that worked for them and ensured the use of the materials that had already been printed for their launch events.  The time you spent on this solution saved the customer several thousands of dollars.  During a call yesterday, the program manager commented how amazing this team has been and how happy she is with the support from our team.\n\n186#Website in a day|Matt, on Monday evening,  I asked you if you could add a blurb about Michelle Obama with a picture and a link to WorkHuman on the WorkHuman leaders page. By Tuesday at lunch, this was completed! You had to involve a lot of people internally to get it done too. This is important because it makes it easier for our leaders to see the big news about Mrs. Obama and also find all the details realted to the WorkHuman conference, rather than have the page become and island. It also helps consolidate the amount of links we need to send out for our leadership marketing efforts. Great job jumping on this and helping so quickly, I really appreciate it!\n\n187#WorkHuman Announcement Engine|The journey to publicly announce WorkHuman keynotes is a winding road of twists and turns. Stops and starts. Hidden cliffs and long straight drives to the end.  There are so many parts that play into a successful launch - and making everything look and sound great internally and externally and getting the wide world ready to embrace the share news, updates, and more.  Thank you to all of you of your continued fantastic work, patience, attitude, and diligence in making this year's WorkHuman line-up a sure-fire promo hit!\n\n188#Commitment to Website Revisions|Matt - thanks for your help revising the Globoforce website. You took pages of edits and methodically made the requested changes. Your knowledge of the website architecture allowed you to tackle this deliverable quickly. You have a great eye for what works, and always keep brand consistency in mind. Best of all, you're so easy to work with. I'm looking forward to partnering on the larger redesign.\n\n189#Proactive considerations for the WorkHuman website|Thank you for being so proactive in your considerations for website security for Michelle O.  Fantastic leadership.  This stuff is often behind the scenes - but so important to ensure we're thinking about every potential thing that could happen.  Good work!\n\n190#Reimagine the possibilities!|I wanted to thank you all for the helping with the heavy lift of making sure all of our existing Globoforce assets now showcase our new brand! With a re-brand comes a lot of work and trying to track down all assets to make sure they align perfectly with the new logo and color is not an easy task. Thanks to you all we are able to show our true colors and represent Globoforce in the best way possible!\n\n191#Website changes March 20|Matt, with the opening of the new Framingham office brought the need to update the logo on Globoforce.com as well as our address on the Contact Us page. Thank you for taking care of those important details and keeping us looking good online!\n\n192#Linked Careers Page FTW!|Matt, thank you so much for all your help linking our new ATS careers page - and doing it so quickly! I came to you with a very short deadline and you jumped right in, met with the team, obtained necessary approvals, made the changes and spot-checked everything to make sure the functionality was there and the quality was maintained. You saw the big picture and added so much value to the process. The new ATS is a huge step for recruiting and the company and I can't thank you enough for being so willing to dive in to make it happen! We already have candidate applications pouring in! Thanks so much!\n\n193#Once Again, You're the Shining Star|Matt, you have been a great partner to keep our customers informed of our product release notes.  Every few weeks, I come to you with another request to update our customer portal.  You are always more than willing to help out and post our release notes.  For this past request, I sent you a file that exceeded our file size limits.  You painstakingly took the time to reduce the file to a manageable MB size.  I know that was no easy task and I greatly appreciate the time and effort you put into this task.  Thank you for living our respect for customers value and great job responding to this request.\n\n194#Portals and Beyond|Thank you so much for your recent help on several projects that involve updates to the Customer Portal. It is so important to keep the information fresh and relevant and with a rapidly growing Customer Success team, there was a ton of content to be updated! Thank you for fielding my many requests and making them happen in record time. Our customers will appreciate the refreshed info!\n\n195#After-hours coordination|Thank you for the seamless teamwork displayed in coordinating the Great Place to Work Ireland announcement. From finalizing the press release to posting it on Globoforce.com in advance so we could quickly promote the big announcement on social, it was all smooth. And all done well after business hours, with one team member feeling quite under the weather. Thank you for making sure we got everything done together!\n\n196#WorkHuman CHRO Outreach Campaign|Team - THANK YOU all so very much for your fabulous work on the WorkHuman CHRO outreach campaign.

Great teamwork everyone!\n\n197#Improving WorkHuman Website|Thanks for the quick turnaround with renaming \"News\" to \"Blog\" on the WorkHuman website and getting some fresh posts up so quickly. These moves will help with organic search and set us up for an increased cadence of copy as we ramp toward the conference. Great teamwork and execution.\n\n198#Stepping Up to Make Us Shine!|In recognition of living our value of Urgency!  Matt, you are such a pleasure to work with and always step up to make Globoforce shine in front of our clients.  Last week, out of no where, we received a pretty BIG \"ask\" from one of our newest and largest clients, Schneider Electric.  To help program adoption and reward redemption for the offline population, roughly 40,000  employees, Globoforce is producing 50 Rewards Catalogs featuring gift cards and merchandise available in country by point levels.  And the program manage, Ak, said \"we love the Step Up portal.\"  Can you make this list of changes to the layout of the portal, add a Rewards Catalog category, move other assets around and link all of these catalogs within days so I can share with my HR leadership team at a meeting on Feb 8th.  Ugh!!!  A huge effort, for sure!  And you did all of the heavy lifting, moved things around on your end to accommodate this \"ask\" and in true Matt fashion, kept me in the loop and us, ahead of schedule every step of the way.  I can't thank you enough!!!  The meeting went extremely well and the HR Leadership team is delighted Globoforce has a solution to better support their offline population.  Thanks for Stepping Up and Shining!!!\n\n199#Mindful Meetings - Doing it Right!|I wanted to call out your participation in a wider team meeting we had yesterday.  It was such a great example of doing a meeting right here at Globoforce.  It was collaborative.  It was engaging.  It was open.  You all shared ideas - but also shared concerns about ways we could approach different opportunities - things that could make us more productive.  Questions were asked.  Solutions were brought to the table - with people building ideas off each other.  And it was also fun!  It should be the model for all the meetings we have here.  Great job!\n\n200#WorkHuman App in a Snap!|Matt - Great job in leading our selection process for the WorkHuman app provider.  You were thorough in conducting the search and demos and involving the right people in the process.  Most importantly, you were mindful of our business needs - and ensure that we picked the vendor that was right for us in 2017.  Looking forward to seeing the build out!  Kevin\n\n201#Updates Wizards|Colleen and Matt I would like to thank you for your fantastic, prompt support with the continuous updates I am asking you to make to the careers site and internal signage. I am always impressed at your turnaround times and patience. You are true globostars\n\n202#Kicking off a revolution|When we needed to brainstorm some new campaign concepts for WorkHuman this week, you all jumped on board, immediately throwing out creative and fresh ideas. The resulting campaign concepts are original, timely, and impactful and I can't wait to see how they perform in market.\n\n203#Helpdesk tool design|Matt, I appreciate you dropping other things to work on a design request for our new Helpdesk tool at very short notice. Without knowing anything about the tool in question, you jumped straight in and produced a great looking result. Thanks so much for your input.\n\n204#Teamwork in the name of Working Human!|Last week started off with multiple deliverables, challenging deadlines, custom demos and the knowledge that one of us would be on vacation the following week! Despite a full schedule of meetings and your own full plate of work, you made it a priority to make sure everything was wrapped up and in fantastic shape so I could go into my vacation with a clear mind. This trip means a lot to my family and I, and willingness to jump in to do whatever it took while keeping a positive attitude the entire time is just one of many reasons why it such a privilege working with you every day at Globoforce. Thank you!\n\n205#Lego Team|Thank you all for your dedication to the Lego door opener. This project required resources from every marketing department and you all stepped up without hesitation.  The creative and content team came up with innovative approaches for packaging and messaging.  We had tight deadlines for the Microsite during the busiest time of the year - But, Matt and Brian put in the extra time to make sure it was ready for Ignite. Operations spent hours talking through workflows and how to best execute this campaign from a user-experience perspective. Anddd, we can't forget Dianne who kept us all on track throughout the entire process. Thank you everyone for being such a great team and helping pull this together!\n\n206#Keeping the website up to date|Matt and Brian,  Thank you so much for your promptness in posting the media coverage to the website.

Thanks for keeping our website up to date with the latest content!\n\n207#Answers for Everything .Com|Matt, over the last few months I've come to you with so many questions - about formatting the blog, adding resources to the resource center, updating tracks on WH.com, and most recently for files from the last few customer webinars. Every time I approach you or send you an email, you have a \"let's get this done\" attitude, which makes working with you so easy! I loved our working session to update the agenda on WH.com. You work efficiently and quickly, constantly pushing the web content to be better. Thank you so much!\n\n208#No Sleep 'Til Ignite!|Just wanted to extend a huge thank you to everyone who has been involved in making the Door Opener campaigns a reality this quarter. From the initial concepting and creative brainstorming, to sourcing vendors, developing microsites and emails and packaging, switching direction at the last minute, and finding legos from 7 different vendors, you have all been the definition of \"Dream Team\" on these projects.  I can't wait to see the reactions at Ignite and start testing these door openers in the market. Thanks!!\n\n209#Pivotal Peeps|Just wanted to give a shout out for some awesome go-to attitudes!

I know that we're putting the right people on this project and the end result is going to be amazing! THANK YOU!\n\n210#Perfect Portal Posting!|Matt - Thank you so much for always being so responsive when we need to post content to the Customer Portal.  Whether it's the latest newsletter or Merchant Update, you always get the right information where it needs to be as quickly as possible.  Thank you so much!\n\n211#Marketing Hackathon Success|Thank you for making the first-ever Marketing Hackathon such a success! You embodied all our core values and the results were fantastic. The two-week Marketing sprint made us more agile as a team, brought out new ideas empowering every member of the team, and we found new approaches to market – ideas that could impact both our marketing approach and our go-to market for opportunities ahead. There was a buzz and vibe around the office that was felt by all your enthusiasm and accomplishment - all the way up the executive chain. Simply put, YOU ROCKED IT! Jess, Jill, and Kevin\n\n212#2017 WorkHuman Content!!|Thank you for all of your efforts and urgency to get our WorkHuman agenda draft finalized, speaker outreach started and acceptances, and up on the WorkHuman site.

WE WANT THAT.\"  Then last week I hit you with this huge project, asked if I could tap you to help and you delivered, as always, in a BIG WAY!  Created the portal, added the content, loaded all of the files, 40  files and counting!

Thank you for all your help! Anne Marie\n\n218#Calling Out Greatness for Call for Speakers|Awesome teamwork and coordination to get out our WorkHumanCall for Speakers.

Thank you so much for your efforts!\n\n221#Organic WH Rankings|Matt- Congratulations on driving Workhuman.com to the first page of organic search rankings for pretty much every HR conference term. We're #4 Organically for \"HR Conferences,\" we're #2-3 organically for \"Top HR Conference,\" we're #3 organically for \"Best HR Conference.\" This is SUCH a big deal, this type of ranking can take years and it's amazing that we're in such a strong organic position right now. On top of that, it means that we can get a great volume of inbound traffic without paying for it, AND we are capturing folks who are in market for HR Conferences and raising their hands. I'm so excited about this. Great work.\n\n222#Creative Success for Customer Success!|Kevin, Sarah, Matt, Jen, Kelli and Stacey - Thank you all so much for your contributions to the Customer Engagement data sheet and the Customer Advisory Board micro-site.  Kevin and Sarah, you wrote beautifully, and finessed the content to clearly articulate all the ways in which we can engage customers as well as the benefits for them.  Jen,  you were the architect behind the design concept for the data sheet and came up with the idea for the micro-site that will not only serve as an elegant invitation to the Customer Advisory Board but also as a channel to communicate updates to the event for the CAB participants. Kelli, you designed the fantastic look and feel of the micro-site and Matt, you did all the technical work to turn that vision into a reality.  And Stacey, last but certainly not least you orchestrated all the moving parts to ensure all aspects of the project were delivered right on time.

Matt, you came prepared with the brilliant idea to utilize our very own Marketo templates, and the entire team came prepared to execute on the deliverables we had at hand. Brian, you helped the design team understand the web structure and how to work within the template, explaining step by step divs, padding, and how to build out the assets. Lisa, you helped me from beginning to end with wireframes, presentation, inspiration, and overall guidance on your responsive web design. Mary, you helped facilitate the proper schedule and how to design in the time allotted.

Ok, maybe not quite calligraphy but, your help and attention to detail in writing out personalized notes to over 40 VP level executives at Oracle is greatly appreciated. I know in this age of emails, social media, and text messages how forgettable the written word can be and for that reason, we hope these will stand out even more.

Because of you, our target audience will be able to easily access content that will help promote the great things that happened at WorkHuman.  Thank you!\n\n231#workhuman.com master|Matt –  Thank you so much for getting the WorkHuman wrap up content on workhuman.com.

The conference was the most visually appealing I have ever been to.

I really appreciate it and many thanks for everything! Enjoy!\n\n278#Cvent rockstars|This award is long overdue-but I'm new to the system so sorry about how late it is! I was SO inspired by everyone's willingness to get in a room, roll up the sleeves and stay a bit late to get the job done.

Great, great job on getting this set up and implemented with a super high level of quality...in record time!\n\n288#ST reboot|Jason/Matt/Julie - I was truly impressed by your quick hustle last week.

Great work!\n\n289#Service Timelines Landing Pages|Matt, Anthony,  thank you both for all of the work that you put into the landing pages to get them live for the start of the Service Timelines campaign.

Your work is seamless and it is always a pleasure to work with you on any and all web projects. Thank you for your encouragement and support during the life of the project.

THANK YOU\n\n296#Full Service Support|Matt - Thank you for your holistic approach to the work we do, and your willingness to sit through endless meetings in order to offer us those key moments of value that only you can provide.

See you in a week, and THANK YOU!  - Julie\n\n299#A list of 1000 categories...|Matt, just wanted to say thank you for your dedication and perseverance on creating our PSB Gallery site.

Its going to be a site I use day in and day out, and I cannot wait for the finished piece!\n\n300#Homepage brought to life|What a cool approach you have explored with the new homepage concept, and I am so happy with the progress! You two work very well as a team, and it shows. I can't wait to see the final designs, we'll blow the competition away!\n\n301#New RecognizeThis! Blog Launched!|First of all CONGRATULATIONS!

Thanks again guys - enjoy your awards!\n\n303#Great Project Management and Support|Matt,     Thank you so much for your project management and support on the redesign of Recognize This! Blog. This was my first BIG web project, since working at Globoforce, and I know that it came out so well because of the great support and guidance that you gave. It has been great working with you and getting your technical (and sometimes design!) feedback. Also, you also set up a great project plan in Attask (I think it was your first?).     Above all, thank you so much for having faith in me to do a great job. I am very much looking forward to more great projects and work from the team!    :) yay!\n\n304#Marketo Masters|Hi Guys,    I wanted to thank you both for diving in and helping me figure out some back-end code and trouble shoot other ways to work around the system limitations for our registration form.

Anne Marie\n\n305#Data Driven!|Thank you for quickly gathering the microsite data I needed today, and then some! Your insight helped solidify my gut need to take on the next phase of the project!

The level of detail, research and thought that went into creating Shell's branded home page, awards, posters, microsite etc...was staggering. Shell were gobsmacked by what you had managed to produce with absolutely no assistance from Shell's own branding people. You guys are creative geniuses! Thanks a mill for helping us create such an impactful first impression.\n\n308#Working together = Success|Henry Ford said - \"Coming together is a beginning.  Keeping together is progress.  Working together is success.\" This quote perfectly captures my sentiments.  We should all be proud of the Service Timelines campaign. We had a large team working together towards a common vision. At times that vision became blurry but we stayed the course and developed a kick butt campaign! We have sent 2 of the email touches and have had 9 companies respond and 2 meetings completed. Extraordinary results from an extraordinary team. Thank you all for your contributions!\n\n309#Web leadership|Matt, I can't thank you enough for your leadership and pro activeness on both upgrading WWW and working with me and the CS team on rapid, radical changes to the customer success site.

Well done!\n\n310#Team Support|I wanted to thank you for all your help with developing assets for the Service Timelines Campaign. You were willing to sit down with me and analyze a plan to move forward. If I had a question or issue, you stepped right in and helped me find a solution. You are a valuable resource and a great teammate. I look forward to working with you on future campaigns and projects. Thanks Matt!\n\n311#SSL certificate|Matt, thank you very much for your help with the www.globoforce.com certificate issue.  This was causing problems with outlook clients poping up message errors. You promptly call the support that host our corporate website to get it sorted asap.  Many thanks again.\n\n312#Blog project management|Thanks for everything you're doing to get the RecognizeThis! blog up to speed in terms of SEO, visibility and adoption. Incorporation more visibly into the website, too, is huge for promoting our thought leadership more broadly. And, of course, thank you for the ongoing project management for the site redesign - keeping all of us (especially me) on track to meet deliverables and deadlines is no easy task and is very much appreciated!\n\n313#Workday page|Great job on getting workday on our website! Prospects will see the level of integration and be impressed!\n\n314#Expanding filespace for secure training|Mark/Alberto/Matt - Many thanks for the quick turn around on expanded HD space on the demo server. Because of your leadership, we can have the confidence that our new training videos for GloboDeck will be secured behind AD-protected authentication. It also means a better usability experience for the people consuming the training. Great work!\n\n315#Awesome Web Ad Results|Matt, I was so impressed to see the transformative changes you made turn in to  AMAZING results for pay-per-click. As a result, our ad costs went down 40% and our ad ratings doubled. Both things improve the results, but also make Google serve our ads more frequently. Awesome work!!\n\n316#Web guru!|Matt, thank you so much for stepping in last week when I needed help with a project that required answering questions about PPC, SEO and retargeting.  It would not have been the same without you there to provide your knowledge.

Everything you do is incredibly responsive to the field, it's also proactive in terms of getting results. Our site perform better than ever and the company's history, and for the first time this year, they trump all of our competitors in terms of traffic engagement and experience. Great work!\n\n320#Making Abbott's Day - Client Hero|In recognition of living our value of respect for Urgency!  Everyone raise your hands high and give a big, big round of applause to Matt for quickly helping to resolve an issue with one of our largest clients, Abbott, an issue with their Globoforce custom-built communications and training portal website.  The client reached out and mentioned the link for their Excellence program’s communications and training assets re-directed them to a generic globoforce site.  The local program ambassador in Brazil needed to access these materials for an upcoming All Hands meeting.  Anne Marie directed me to you and you were on the case immediately, determining when we switched servers this content did not get migrated.  In less than a day, all of the communications and training assets were re-instated on the new server.  This was no small feat.  The materials are available in English, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Dutch and Simplified Chinese.  And for each language they have marketing art files, communication templates and a program overview training deck.  On the easy math, that’s 30 assets that were re-instated and ready for use again.  The client is so thrilled with the turnaround, she is sending all of her internal program managers and champions an email reminding them the assets are available and to continue to use them every day to promote and support the program.  That’s fantastic and should result in a spike in activity.  You’re a true Globostar!  Thank you again for all your help and urgency you showed to resolve this matter.  All the best, Traci\n\n321#Great Teamwork|Matt - Thanks so much for meeting with the programs team this week to discuss creative ways that we can integrate our efforts. We look forward to working closely with you to continue to raise the bar with our marketing initiatives.\n\n322#A \"United\" front!|I can't say thank you enough for your \"Respect for Urgency\" in regards to my opportunity with United. Thank you for your incredible turnaround time and sense of urgency.  You are an amazing support to the sales team!\n\n323#Matt Saves the Day (again)!|Hi Matt,  I just wanted to thank you for your help fixing the java script on the Ignite registration pages.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out how it was breaking and you didn't even hesitate to jump in and keep digging until the solution was uncovered.  I can't thank you enough for the help!  Anne Marie\n\n324#To the rescue!|Exceptional job jumping in to help address an issue with the Dow redemption reminder emails. By so quickly updating the GF web page to present well, and allow users to continue on to the Dow site to redeem, this should avoid a large number of users from having access issues and therefore now allow them to redeem.\n\n325#getting it done!|Matt – thank you for all your efforts in getting our emails and landing pages over to Marketo and managing the entire process ever so smoothly. I can’t thank you enough for your diligence and timeliness on this project.  You are always willing to help and take the lead when it comes to our templates.

What you all were able to put together in such a short period of time is truly impressive!  The teamwork and support you provide to the field is amazing and incredibly appreciated!  Thank you.\n\n328#Attention to Quality for Our Templates|Hi Matt,    I just wanted to thank you for all your diligent hard work at not only project managing the development of the new landing page templates, but also taking the reigns if things came in that didn't meet your standards and making them the best they could be! Our entire team benefits from your attention to detail.  Your willingness to dive in and even learn all of the coding to help the process along is fantastic.  Thank you for all of your help!  ~Anne Marie\n\n329#Twitter Promotion for HR Tech|Matt and Kerry - great work driving the Tweet campaign for #HRTechConf. I'm sure as a result of your leadership, the conference will be buzzing about Globoforce and our #THNX campaign. It also helps position us as a innovative tech company. Nice Work!\n\n330#Cisco Landing Page|Matt, Per usual, when I said there was a high priority need for a page for Cisco, you dove right in.

Jess and Kelli - the look and feel of the branding for the custom demo and notifications was jazzy, cool and energetic - a perfect fit for our messaging.    Charlie - coordinating the Thank You video with Eric was one of those over-the-top details that demonstrated to the BMO team how committed we are to being a great partner.    Thank you to everyone on this team for being great at what you do and injecting so much inspiration and creativity into the BMO presentation this past Monday.  It made the presenters look like we had taken the time to not only understand our Customer at a deep level, but went beyond that to demonstrate with real examples what Partnership with Globoforce means.\n\n"
