"0#You Made This Moment Possible|Two members of the JESA program team were able to join us at the Dublin PM Learning Lab last week – which was only possible because of your support.  The team is based in Morocco and required visas to travel – and the application process required supporting documents from the event host. Christie: thank you for your quick response to my initial request. You helped clarify the requirements and worked with me to refine the exact information needed. We navigated several rounds of revisions as the customers’ plans evolved, and your guidance was essential.  Doug and Joe: when the application deadline was unexpectedly moved up, you stepped in to help finalize the details and quickly updated the documents to reflect last-minute changes, including adjustments to the signatory.  Isobel: I truly appreciate your fast turnaround on my end-of-day email. You coordinated with Jim to get the documents signed and returned digitally within minutes, and then ensured the hard copies were sent to the JESA team to meet the submission deadline.  Thanks to your efforts, Aya (PM) and Ibtissame (PO) were able to meet their Workhuman team in person, participate in the Learning Lab, and connect with their peers. They had an amazing experience, and your behind-the-scenes work played a big role in making that happen.\n\n1#Thanks a Million on Gratitude Day!|Hi Team, I just wanted to take a moment to say a big thank you to each of you for your amazing support with my tickets, purchase orders and vendor onboarding. Your collaboration and quick responses have really helped keep things running smoothly. Whether it was jumping in to resolve queries, fast-tracking urgent requests or helping onboard vendors, I truly appreciate it. Thanks again for being such great partners!\n\n2#The Cart-tract Negotiators|Cheers to this group for assisting with all the paperwork for the End of Summer Celebration event. I am grateful for your assistance with contracts and insurance needs that arose last minute and thank you for executing them in a timely manner. I appreciate it a ton as it helped the event to go off without a hitch and even allowed some of us to arrive in style 🛒Thank you.\n\n3#Marketing Placement Forms|Joe and Erica, Big shoutout, and thank you for all the help with the marketing placement forms! Your attention to detail and teamwork are truly appreciated. I know this process isn’t easy for any of us, but together we’re making it happen and getting things done. THANK YOU!\n\n4#Strong Start from a Strong First Line of Defense!|Thank you all for your valuable contributions to FY25 Phase 1 of Internal Controls Testing.   Your responsiveness to test requests and thoughtful engagement with follow-up questions have helped drive meaningful progress. It’s great to see the improvements made since last year - a clear sign of the team’s commitment and growth.   Thank you also for embracing our new GRC tool, Workiva, throughout this process. Your adaptability and engagement with the platform have significantly enhanced how we collaborate and track progress.  It’s especially encouraging to see you taking ownership of the risks inherent in your daily work -identifying, managing, and addressing them directly. This level of accountability is key to building a strong control environment and supporting a successful control-based audit. While there are still areas to refine, we’re confident that with continued focus and collaboration, we will get there. Let’s keep the momentum going, your efforts are making a real difference!   Thanks again for your continued dedication and for being a dependable first line of defense!\n\n5#Renewals Master|To Joe, Thanks so much for your consistent  help and reviews on our renewals. You're patience and hard work are deeply valued. Thanks, Orlagh\n\n6#InterAccess Granted!|Cheers to the incredible cross-functional teamwork that brought the 2025 SOW with InterAccess across the finish line—just in time for the European Accessibility Act going into effect on June 28.  Huge thanks to Procurement and Legal for their responsiveness and partnership. Special shoutout to Doug for diving into Engineering’s open questions and helping surface thoughtful, scalable solutions & responses. And to Mark and Joe, your work aligning the SOW with past precedent while protecting our budget and resources was key for a smooth audit.  This executed scope ensures compliance with EU regulations and unlocks a net new capability: providing VPATs and ACRs to prospects and clients (hopefully by EOY). It also reinforces our commitment to accessibility by addressing client-agnostic code, ensuring a consistent, inclusive experience across all recognition programs.  Thanks again to everyone involved—this is a big win for our team, our clients, and our mission.\n\n7#Workiva End User Engagement!|A huge thanks to all our business process control owners and preparers for your engagement with the internal control testing and assurance programme through Workiva! We have come a long way from go-live; from learning how to navigate the tool, providing useful feedback on improvements/dashboard, to now fully engaging in the tool and allowing us to systemise our end to end control management & assurance program. This wouldn't be possible without your continued engagement in responding to quarterly assessments, process doc updates, evidence requests and issue remediation tasks! Looking forward to building on this for H2! Thank you!\n\n8#New Customer Alert: Welcome USB!|Big congratulations to Dawn and the entire Workhuman team for winning USB! Like any major sales deal, we faced unique prospect requests, challenges, and a few last-minute twists. But thanks to the team’s dedication, hard work, and strong rapport with the USB leaders, persistence paid off. This account has been worked on feverishly since the first meeting in Q3 2023. WH became a finalist in USB’s RFP process in Q4 2024, presented finalist pitch in Q1 2025, and officially became their VOC in Q1 2025. It became clear their previous vendor, Augeo, struggled to connect business results to outcomes—and the USB team was ready to elevate their employee experience. USB pushed us to be great, and we delivered. We responded by developing a custom employee survey to ensure every voice is heard, and partnered with Submittable, an all-in-one award management platform, to help centralize recognition efforts and run seamless internal competitions. These solutions showcased our commitment to innovation, excellence, and Recognition Done Right. Additionally, our incredible team doubled down on what mattered most—delivering a clear understanding of success metrics, creating a frictionless employee experience, and empowering moments of authentic recognition. From seamless workflows to a culture of gratitude, we proved we could be the strategic, innovative, and experienced partner USB was looking for. We’re thrilled to welcome USB, with 80,000 employees in the banking and finance industry, to the Workhuman community—and we’re proud to see them quickly become champions of our mission. A huge shoutout to the extended Workhuman team who made this possible. Leading the charge was Dawn O’Brien, whose leadership, work ethic, and relationship-building were critical to our success. Thank you all for your incredible contributions—and CONGRATULATIONS on a huge win!  Recognition Done Right isn’t just a slogan. It’s what we do!\n\n9#Constant Support|Taking a moment to say thank you for the support. You all kept the ship running on contracts, projects and SME areas for critical requests while I was out of office and it is greatly appreciated\n\n10#Rapid response|Thanks you both for your support at (very!) short notice to get a contract amendment over the line- this has resulted in a significant commercial win for stakeholders. Great work and as ever, much appreciated!\n\n11#To the First Four Months of 2025|I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible support and dedication you have shown over the past four months. Thank you for covering for me while I was on leave, handling POs, setting up vendors, ensuring speedy signatures on critical renewals, working on updating contract database. It has been nothing short of amazing.  Thank you for demonstrating the true spirit of teamwork and collaboration. I am truly fortunate to work with such a talented and supportive group of individuals.  Thank you for your understanding. I am immensely grateful for each and every one of you.\n\n12#Liam closes Grünenthal for 1 million Euros|I am so delighted to share that Liam has closed his first deal at Workhuman with Grünenthal, a German pharma organisation for a very cool €1 million euros.   Liam created a masterpiece here. Grünenthal was one of the first calls he took at WH where he discovered the team were working to get sign off on a recognition initiative. Liam leapt into action and was all over key stakeholders ensuring he added value in every interaction  - he even reached out to the CEO with a  tailored message and got a good response back. In fact , our main sponsor told us that Liam's email to the CEO still gets talked about positively :-). Using all our support and data  that Liam had  equipped them with, the team got approval and launched the RFP with our template. Liam fully owned every step which resulted in them choosing us. When the contract came in today, this is the note he received “Your continuous advice and guidance has been pivotal for this agreement\"  The multi-threading, persistence, focus on value, coaching and guidance Liam did throughout this sales cycle was spectacular and is a great example of how to build trusted partnerships.    As always, there are many who helped  enable this outcome. Firstly,  the EMEA AE team played a part in winning the deal. Bas met with them back in 2023, Pedro helped  prep for the demo, James supported the RFP pitch, Joe coached Liam around the German market,  Alex shared content from his RFPs  and Joanna answered a great many questions. Our wonderful BDRs  also played a role with Kyle and Emma both engaging them at  Gartner and  Forum.   Michael gave incredible support – he was diligent, patient and an integral partner as were Joe, Christie and Hillary. Jose, Clare and Orlagh supported the RFP presentation  with Liam and James and the CHRO gave glowing feedback.  Finally, a big thank you to Adrian who helped to connect them with others  around Workcouncil approvals.   Such an impressive first win Liam.\n\n13#All the Documents You Could Ever Need|Joe,   Thank you very much for compiling all of the WE vendor documents. Having everything centralized in one location greatly improves our ability to access the necessary information efficiently when needed. I appreciate your effort in streamlining this process.\n\n14#Legal Legends|Hillary and Joe, thank you for all the legal support on our sponsorships for Live.  From contract template creation, to redlines, signature trafficking, and honestly – just a lot of quick response asks I have come to you with.  I appreciate your partnership in bringing this new program to life.  Onward to 2026!\n\n15#Contract Queires|I just wanted to take a moment to thank you both for the very prompt and detailed replies to my questions in regarding contracts for  the 2024 Audit. Great team work was shown - it is always a pleasure to collaborate with such exceptional colleagues.   Your efforts have significantly helped the finance team stay on track with our tight deadlines. Thank you once again, and I hope you enjoy the reward.\n\n16#Patience & urgency at the same time!|Joe - a massive thank you for your support across multiple NDAs recently! There's a lot going on here at Workhuman when you are a new rep and I am still getting up to speed with certain processes / habits inc. NDAs. Grateful for you helping to rush a couple through a little last minute.com (you might have to look that reference up) - and for your patience while I figure it all out! 🙌\n\n17#Secret Weapon|Joe - I know I don't come to you every day but when they do, you make the impossible happen. Thank you so much with my urgent request. I don't like to have these emergencies but they do occur from time to time in the event world. I really appreciate you understanding the situation and saving the day.\n\n18#Urgent Informatica Renewal|Joe, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for your invaluable assistance with the urgent signing we needed for the Informatica Renewal. The situation escalated quickly from a P3 request to a P1 due to us hitting our volume quota, which necessitated immediate action. Consequently, we had to commit to a 14-month term to ensure the business could resume operations as swiftly as possible. Thanks to your prompt and efficient support, we were able to achieve this in record time. Your dedication and responsiveness were crucial in navigating this challenge, and I truly appreciate your efforts. Your help has been instrumental in getting us back on track, and I cannot thank you enough for your unwavering support.\n\n19#Signature Delegations in Record Speed|Joe - great work chasing down and closing out the 2025 signature delegation forms in record speed! You are the fastest draw in the East yet again!\n\n20#Master Archivist|Joe, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you for all the invaluable support you've provided over the last few months, both during the Q4 crunch and so far this New Year. You've jumped in on so many items- taking fast tracks, catching errors in docs, finding documents that nobody else can locate, and supporting signatures on contracts which, but for your actions, would have missed critical deadlines.   You my friend, are invaluable! I don't know how any legal team could function without a Joe!\n\n21#Four Contracts in Four Weeks!!!!|I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks for all your support on the MNDAs for Grainger, Fortune Brands, SSM Health, and Baxter...all in less than a month! Each of these clients required us to use their specific templates, which added complexity to the process. However, your flexibility and diligence during the redline reviews ensured we successfully navigated through them all. Your hard work and adaptability are truly appreciated. Thank you for your dedication!\n\n22#Thanks For Your Help|Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for your recent help with so many different parts of our contracting process. Your dependability and willingness to jump in whenever needed is so very appreciated. Thanks Joe!\n\n23#First win of the year!!|I am thrilled to celebrate the addition of our newest customer, Link Logistics! Ryan was able to turn this deal around QUICK - 70 days to be exact from opening the opportunity to close! A few things led to this. Link chose us to replace their current vendor Reward Gateway (previously Fond) because first and foremost, we established a consultative approach from the jump; explaining the pitfalls of a homegrown solution with Workday Extension, sharing possible other avenues they could explore for an employee recognition program, and being clear about our partnership model and why our clients value it (and that our technology and partnership were superior than any other). We established ourselves as the \"recognition experts\" (quote from CHRO), and showed that we can help them make decisions quickly and guide them to a successful program. Ryan did a great job establishing our business terms early with Link’s procurement team and held firm on those having understanding their timeline as leverage.  Additionally, the client committed to 83% budget spend (500k/600k) and a $500 IPE! HOW you may ask? Well, this was a lift and shift program with an established budget with a desire to grow. Ryan established our minimum contracted spend was 500k with no T4C on the first call and reinforced those requirements at every interaction. Upon entering negotiations, we worked closely with Chuck and his team to understand where we had flexibility to hold the line, while giving the client the wins they needed to move forward. Special thanks to Matt for initiating the sales process, Nina for her expertise during the demo and follow-up, AP for jumping on a call late in the process to share his expertise, Chuck and Peibei for working with us on the business terms and where we could be flexible, Dan for ensuring a smooth contract process (with just one legal call!), and Joe for quickly executing the MNDA. GREAT work to all!\n\n24#Cheers to the Incredible Support|Hey Joe and Callum, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you both for being absolute lifesavers this year. Your help with all the urgent requests in 2024 has been incredible (specially the December last-minute ones!!!) and I truly appreciate your dedication and hard work. Looking forward to continuing our partnership in 2025 and achieving even greater things together!\n\n25#Risk control on the up, thanks to you!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your exceptional efforts and dedication in managing our business internal controls throughout 2024. Your commitment to excellence and proactive approach have been instrumental in fostering and growing our internal control culture.  In particular, I would like to extend a special thank you to our Control Owners for taking ownership of their controls and providing invaluable input into improving our business internal controls. Your insights and contributions have significantly enhanced our processes and helped mitigate risks effectively.  We have come a long way, but there is still some work to be done. I am confident that with your continued dedication and support, we will get there together.  I also want to acknowledge the vital part our Control Preparers play in this process. Your diligence and hard work in ensuring the smooth implementation and ongoing success of our controls are truly appreciated.  Once again, thank you for going above and beyond in 2024. I look forward to continuing to work alongside you in 2025 and achieving even greater success together. Our risk control efforts are stronger than ever, thanks to you!\n\n26#Thank you!!!|Leaving the incredible WH Legal Department is bittersweet, but I’m deeply grateful for this formative experience.

Almost $1M was generated globally - and every part of that required marketing order forms, signatures, addendums, customer set ups, invoicing etc etc! And of course, plenty of queries and chasing thrown in on top to keep us all on our toes :P Appreciate all of your support in making this happen! And the good / bad news? 2025 will be even bigger :)\n\n28#Legal Legends 2024!|A massive thank you to the Legal team for all your incredible support throughout 2024! 🎉 Together, we closed out over 700 requests and slashed renewal and new services timelines by more than 40%. Your expertise, input, and collaboration have been absolutely invaluable.  We couldn’t have achieved this without you—thank you for being such an essential part of the team’s success! I look forward to collaborating even more in 2025.  Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!\n\n29#Thank you to our Finance, Legal & Infosec Partners|As 2024 comes to a close, the Ecommerce Global Merchandise team would like to say a heartfelt thank you to our finance and legal partners, for your support, guidance and teamwork.

Through each twist and turn, contract after contract, urgent request, process change, new initiative, challenging headwinds, and life changes this team always rises to the occasion and banned together to make it happen.  I am going to miss working with each of you, keep crushing it team and don't be a stranger!!\n\n31#Mid-Market Dream Team|I wanted to let you all you know how grateful I am for you every day!    Mid-Market has a lot of moving parts to get points in the hands of the employees and each one of you is a critical part of that.  From drafting (so many) order forms, to sending and tracking them in DocuSign (and reminding clients again and again), to invoicing and chasing payments.   Without all of you, this process wouldn't be possible.   When I was on vacation for 2 weeks you all just kept on going and took on various parts so everything could keep moving without interruption.   It truly allowed me to disconnect and relax knowing that these programs were in great hands.  Thank you all for being part of this amazing group!\n\n32#Thank you!!!|Hi Joe and Cal, just wanted to say a big thanks to both of you for all the help with the urgent tickets!!\n\n33#Cisco Switzerland - Fully Executed|Thank you Christie and Joe for all your support in getting Cisco Amendment over the line for us.

Much appreciated!\n\n39#Q1- Celebrating our legal team|I want to extend my deepest gratitude for your exceptional support throughout the first quarter. 18 significant effort tickets related to renewals and new services in the Technology/Product department, as well as a few more from Finance.

Your support is truly appreciated.  Mariana\n\n40#URGENT: Nothing To Proof Here|Just wanted to send an overall thank you to this team of financial experts, contract wizards and valuable vendorships. I have had a ton of URGENT requests lately (and I’m sure they won’t be the last 😳) and I truly appreciate you paying close attention to them and moving them right along through the process. A lot of last minute items constantly come up when planning events and you make a boy feel right at ease knowing you’ll always turn things around right away.

Congratulations Bobby and team on this 16-month journey of running hot and cold and back to hot again! In September of 22’ Rocket was very assertive in their ambition to work with us and get a deal signed by December.  We had a senior level contact and the CHRO was a former customer, so all indicators pointed to executing last year.  After Omar and Bobby conducted the investment modeling and business case development one of our main contacts was no longer with Rocket Software and budget approval was not secured.  This deal went somewhat cold.  Connor Horan worked with Bobby to reengage Rocket Software after they went dark and Tom leveraged his association with the CHRO, by August, we were back on track to close a deal for Q1 2024!  As we know, these opportunities follow some unchartered paths and Rocket is no exception. After being made promises last year, that the customer didn’t keep, Bobby put his Challenger hat on, took control of the process providing straightforward communications outlining expectations, which garnered both apologies and commitment by the decision makers at Rocket! When red lines arrived on December 29th, Christie Hynds, Joe DiMattia, and Chuck Labovitz didn’t hesitate to bring this over the finish line to be a win for 2023!  Congratulations Bobby and Team on this $892K win and another great customer in the Tech Industry!  KUDO's to Rocketing yourself to 23% above sales plan in 2023, Bobby!\n\n48#EMEA Gift Card Marketing|I wanted to say a BIG thank you to this group for all your support and hard work this year on EMEA gift card marketing. There were several new marketing placements in 2023 and I appreciate your dedication in getting each one signed off and across the line - not to mention the patient approach you took with new subscribers to this process! Any queries regarding POs, paperwork or invoicing were always addressed immediately and resolved quickly - thanks to your amazing attention to detail and professionalism. Wishing you all the best for 2024!\n\n49#FM Global WIN! $1,750,000|11 months in the making, starting from a webinar in January attended by FM Global’s HR team, there had been many deposits made prior to this but the webinar was a catalyst for engagement. Thank you, Connor, for your quick follow up post webinar to secure meetings!  Bobby worked his social surround magic and identified key contacts that have been former Workhuman Customers. Once again, Michael Robb and Amanda Briggs worked RFP magic, but even more impactful was their guidance on post submission questions!  No RFP is complete without a formal presentation, Bobby partnered with David Stott to put together a dynamic team discussing investment and partnership!  Hari Date jumped in for the post RFP follow up to facilitate thought leadership on YOS investment and Maggie Daley provided expertise on how launch and communications will be executed! Feeling a little burned by their current provider, partnership continued to be a concern and Jenn Reimert got us through many hurdles delaying the process, cultivating the executive alignment relationship!  So many hurdles overcome, but product and pricing were still an issue.  Mindi Ennis provided guidance to the team regarding how our e-commerce ecosystem works, squelching their request to know every time a product changes on the platform.  Mindi showed compassion for their concern yet didn’t waiver in our confidence as best in class.  This afforded us to remove the product request from the contracts.  Next up, Pricing! Chris O’Sullivan and Chuck Labovitz were creative in finding a solution that worked for the business and FM Global.  Lastly, no deal is ever complete without the guidance of our legal team!  Joe DiMattia's responsiveness once the document request occurred, Christie Hynds took the lead on turning those redlines amidst countless requests and Hillary Mahoney’s worked through those fun nuances that always come up! Congratulations Bobby on a terrific win and thank you to this incredible team!\n\n50#Appreciation for Swift MNDAs Amid SF challenges!|Joe, I wanted to extend a BIG thank you for your swift turnaround on the recent MNDAs for Indivior and TowneBank! Your efficiency is especially commendable, considering the challenges we faced with Salesforce acting up and hindering our request entry.  Your dedication to overcoming obstacles and ensuring timely completion does not go unnoticed. It's a pleasure working with someone as reliable and responsive as you.  Thanks again for your exceptional effort!\n\n51#Havas and Saleforce over the line|Big thank you Christie for tackling not one but two urgent renewals, swiftly getting them approved and ready for signature! You always made yourself available for calls especially on Havas and your efforts were key to getting both agreements over the line.  And thank you Joe for seamlessly ensuring those renewals were issued for signature and approved right on time! Couldn't have gotten these over the line without you both\n\n52#Speedy execution|thank you all for prioritizing and speedily executing our Audio visual contract for 100 staples,  minor last minute changes had delayed this but once it was in your court your quickly returned it with all relevant details corrected, all the I's dotted and every T crossed.  I appreciate the speed at which you got this closed out.\n\n53#Drilling for wins - 380k WIN for Joanna|It gives me great pleasure to announce that Joanna has closed yet another deal with  Seadrill for 380k for both R&R  and celebrations. This sales  cycle started earlier in the year with a great meeting scheduled by Cameron Hinds with their Head of Reward.  Seadrill were actively exploring recognition, and various competitors before us. However, between Joanna's impressive business acumen and Challenger sales skills and Maggies support demonstrating ROI, Workhuman  was soon the front runner 💕  A huge thanks also to Mindi  who helped us brainstorm creative e-comm solutions for them. Thank you also to Joe and Dan who rallied to get the paperwork to the signatory at short notice.   Congratulations Joanna - once again, you took superb  control of the sales cycle,  building strong relationships and holding your contacts accountable at each stage. When it looked like the deal might slip into the first week of November , you reminded him of his October commitment and both teams rallied to get it done. Beautiful work here.\n\n54#Imperial Dade Canada for the Win!|Congratulations Brandon for bringing Imperial Dade Canada over the finish line and the team who were integral to making this deal happen!  This $250k deal is full of fun tidbits, demonstration of team collaborations and learnings!    Yes - understanding cultures is important and THANK YOU Laura and Jessie for taking the time to connect on all things Canada and Canadian Corporate Culture so we could be well positioned as the perfect partner, even with our Canadian Based Competition in the mix!

VOC Awarded and one of the comments was, \"I just like the way Brandon and Maggie interacted with each other on the demo, it felt like the type of people we wanted to work with!\"  Kudo's Maggie and Brandon for being your genuine self and building that strong rapport that shows to our customers!    Yes - We had to work through various iterations of pricing and verbiage to minimize the prospects concerns.  Maggie your guidance on Reach, Frequency and Value had them thinking strategically.  Chuck you were clutch in crafting the order form commercials in a way that worked for our customer and Christie you worked that verbiage magic so both parties were happy.  Yes - Buyers are liars! Thank you to Joe for helping us navigate the nuances of the order forms offer valid through dates.  3rd time is indeed a charm!   Your patience and partnership truly was 2nds to none with this one!

Congratulations on a great win that will no doubt lead to more wins and growth with Imperial Dade!\n\n55#Constant Support|Joe, lately you have been an immense support. Whether it's last minute signatures that get us within a hair's breadth of a deadline, finding obscure documents that no one else can, or helping us with irregular vendor requests, you're always able to get us out of a jam.

This is a wonderful story as it is one of the first calls Joanna led when she joined Workhuman (with the expert support of Joseph Moscardini)  Circet,  a telecom network service provider, has been suffering with low morale and sadly numerous suicides across the business and are passionate about building a culture of gratitude.  Joanna has demonstrated sales excellence across this short sales cycle – creating key executive relationships, building pain and challenging the business about the cost of status quo. She has been tremendous in taking control – one of the key traits of being a true challenger – and has held her main contact accountable at each stage. So much so,  that he was texting her excitedly at 10.30pm last night to confirm he had signed the contracts on time 😊.  Fabulous work Joanna - I know this is just the beginning for you and it is inspiring to see what you are building in a short space of time.  As always, it is a team effort in getting these deals across the board. Our talented consultants, Rob Schmitter (still very missed) and Maggie were instrumental  in building credibility and took a key role in value creation/investment modelling. With Stuart Curtis's support, MJ met with with Head of HR at a CIPD event in Dublin where they shared our book and Orlagh was fabulous as always in getting our DPA signed off. Last but not least, our legal and finance  partners, Emily, Joe and Chuck  were instrumental in getting this deal signed yesterday.   Congratulations Joanna – Team EMEA is thrilled for you\n\n60#Win - Medical University of South Carolina $500K|I am so excited to share this win for Lisa Landon and team.  Lisa has worked the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) opportunity for the past two years. This win is significant as MUSC includes employees in a vertical that has not been a typical target for us, education.  Pre-Challenger, Lisa put her amazing, professional selling skills to work to create the need for recognition with MUSC.  She built solid relationships and used all our strategic sales tools including a key contact attending Workhuman Live Atlanta. The solutions for MUSC include strategic recognition and the Celebrations bundle (customer paid).  I love the picture above. This was taken after the RFP finalist pitch with MUSC. A very special thanks and much gratitude to Marcy and Nuvs for contributing their expertise, time and enthusiasm for this opportunity.  I cannot thank Christie, Joe, Hillary, Julia and Chuck enough for their focus this week on document management, edits and attention to get to final contracts by month end.  Please join me in congratulating this team and welcoming MUSC to the Workhuman family.\n\n61#Expanding Customer Central's reach|Thank you, Hillary and Joe, for your partnership as we recently expanded Customer Central access to help set future customers up for early success with our new program planning and guidance content.

We've just got our first future customers into the site this week and the feedback is already positive -- and will hopefully yield well-designed programs and more efficient implementations. Thank you again!\n\n62#There is Always a Story Behind the Win - Deciphera|A True Team Effort to get this deal sealed!

Many thanks to Jonathan and Liam who joined a call well after hours  and only 24 hours till quarter end to provide comfort around our security standards (you two can go get that pint now).   Finally coming into the home stretch Joe getting documents to the customer late on a Friday and Hillary continuing to work the nuances of the crazy signature process the client had and Nick remaining in touch and available to sign each document as they trickled in one by one.   Through it all, Bobby continued to insure communication flow was consistent, all parties were up to speed with what was needed next and called in various contacts at Deciphera, even those on a fishing charter in Nantucket, to keep the flow of signatures going!  Way to go team on getting this $600k Deal Sealed for Q2!\n\n63#Legacy contracts|Joe, Mariana & Rob, I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for the support you provided by reviewing the extracted data from our legacy contracts, and your dedication in ensuring the accuracy of the content that we loaded into our new Contract Management System, Icertis.

To make it work, we had a very limited window in which to get things started. Achieving that timeline required a short set of turns on commercial terms and vendor agreements, which this team delivered amazingly well!

It takes patience to dig into the detail and we appreciate your diligence. Thanks\n\n121#Teams got it covered!|Thank you all for the coverage you provided as I took a much needed vacation! You each were quick to jump in and pick up work while I was away and it was so wonderful to know I could rely on my team to field requests, get signatures, answer questions and do allllll the things! Thanks everyone!\n\n122#Quite the *learning* journey!|Team, I can't thank you all enough for your efforts throughout this deal! Thank you, Orlagh and Michael, for a speedy response with the security assessment, really made the process easy for our new customer. Sylvain, I can't thank you enough for the endless hours you put in, from sending contract emails at 9 pm to contract and pricing negotiations. Coursera came back with a mediocre investment level after discussing best practices. You provided instant value by shifting their thought about what a healthy investment looked like and doubled the deal size!! Thank you, Chris, for helping out with the financial side of the deal by providing us with a strong incentive that helped us push this through the finish line. Judith, thank you for scheduling times with us to discuss customer handoff as we waited for the contract. The Coursera team is excited to get the ball rolling and get their new recognition program live! Legal... I don't even know where to begin. I must say, Coursera was a tough cookie to crack, but you stayed persistent and adamant about holding the line on our MSA. Every time we thought we agreed on terms, they would come back with yet, another red line. You were instrumental in this whole process. Without you, we wouldn't be here celebrating this amazing win! I learned so much from this sales process, and it took me through a rollercoaster of emotions. Coursera wasn't lying when they say they are in the business of teaching others. I'm incredibly grateful for all of you, and I look forward to many more wins as a team!\n\n123#Tremendous Support|Joe: Thanks a million for your turn-around on an urgent document support for Dell this AM.
