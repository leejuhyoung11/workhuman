While I know we feel a bit in defense mode lately, all of you are still staying focused on how best to increase investments across our customers, create epic moments that deliver a truly special connection with Workhuman and elevating the conversations with Executives at our largest customers.  I know leading our largest customers is a big job, tons of responsibility and sometimes thankless, but I see you and all that you’re doing each and every day to bring the best to our customers and Workhuman.  I love having the time together to connect, learn from each other, laugh, celebrate our families and so much more. You all bring so much joy to me and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you do.  Cheers to each of you and I can’t wait to see our ideas come to life.\n\n46#Harnessing Good Energy for bp!|Thank you to everyone who pitched in on the bp RFI that was just submitted today (1 minute before deadline!). There were a lot of tricky questions, but I venture Kevin Nealon would approve of the way we harnessed in the good energy and blocked out the bad (Harness. Energy. Block. Bad. Feel the flow. Feel it.) Thank you again!\n\n47#Quality & Precision|Dear Janet, Robyn, and Sheri,  Thank you for your support on the Biogen renewal RFP the past few weeks. With multiple proposals going on simultaneously, benefiting from your account expertise in completing the RFP questionnaire and leadership on the pricing front was invaluable in terms of putting our best foot forward.  Thanks again! James\n\n48#When A Plan Beautifully Comes Together!|I am in complete awe of how quickly you jumped in to strategize and execute our plan to support TFS! Our swift and compassionate response not only exemplified our values at Workhuman, but will truly make an impact on a client who is navigating through rough seas. I can't thank you enough for jumping in to assist, for your ideas and for your commitment to ensuring we kept what was most important as the nucleus of our message - SUPPORT! Although we faced a few challenges in bringing this video to fruition, you did not give up and I am sincerely grateful for the role you played in bringing this masterpiece to life!\n\n49#Amazing work to Support our largest Customers!|Wow, what a fantastic couple of days together!  SCDs, you showed up with dedication and fortitude to continue moving the ball forward at our largest customers.  There was a ton of creative thinking, partnering to support one another and focus on growth that we need to deliver, despite the challenges that are there in some instances.  The passion for striving to excellence is so apparent in your mindset at the work each of you are doing daily.  For those of you who joined us who are working alongside us to make the impossible possible, thank you!  Your partnership and determination to help deliver on the goals we all set together is beyond appreciated.  Each of you showed up, ready to listen, bring ideas to help support and grow our customers from each of your organizations.  The work we do together is so inspiring, and I can’t wait to see our hard work move the needle and celebrate together in our wins.  Cheers and thanks to each of you!\n\n50#Riter - On Time|Cannot say enough about how meaningful, respectful, and efficient or QBRs went with your leadership and time management. Was really a factor in making this one of the most productive and effective meetings we've had (IMO). Thank you.\n\n51#Wow Work for WHLive 2023!|Where to even start with the awesomeness this team brought to WHLive 2023!  You all inspired our largest customers to show up to WH Live in San Diego from across the globe (not just in the US, but from Europe and Asia).  Not only did they show up and advocate without question, but you also got them to speak, bring their teams and champion change at their organizations. I was beyond proud to see each of you hosting your customers with enthusiasm and spirit, helping them to understand the impact they can bring to their companies, laughing and building champions of Workhuman.  You played an integral part in creating the experience for them at Workhuman live.  I was pleased to see the partnership in helping to create experiences for those customers where colleagues couldn't be present.  I loved getting to hear first-hand from our largest customers about the partnerships you all have held for years in some cases and just a few months in other cases and how much it means to them as individuals and their organizations.  You all inspire me every day and the impact you're delivering to our customers makes all the difference.  Massive congratulations to all of you on a very successful WHLive 2023!\n\n52#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.  Your efforts created an unforgettable experience for over 1,500 attendees and reconfirmed our event as the world's leading HR conference.  Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention. Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n53#Dream Team!|Talk about the dream team right here! All i can say is what a team effort with the recent Biogen risk. What started at the beginning of the week as a challenge we were faced with and a customer wanting to cut back, turned into a major positive where they have now agreed to move forward with converting what was $3.3M last year in cash awards, to now non-cash awards!! All in the matter of hours at that! While Biogen is reducing the value of those large value cash awards, it is still a massive win to have 77% of what was invested last year in cash awards to now be non-cash, especially during a time when Biogen was looking to cut back in non-cash initially! This team came together to talk about the challenge we were faced with, review data quickly to make an informative and clear decision on a strategy, get a call scheduled in less than 24 hours and deliver a pitch that resulted in an email from the customer less than an hour later asking us to move these cash awards to non-cash. This was a prime example of what great looks like, and i am so fortunate to be able to work alongside each of you to make this happen! Amazing job team!!!\n\n54#Game changer, Sheri for the WIN!!!|Sheri!! Sheri!! You should write a Whitepaper on \"Leading companies through change by keeping the humans at the center.\" It's game changer,  Sheri you need at the helm. You masterfully put together a strategy and plan to illustrate to GE how critical social recognition is during times of change, backed by their own data, how imperative it is not to have disruption in the program, and how to seamlessly transition the Impact Awards program into their critical talent and programs during changing times as GE spun into 3 independent businesses. Check, check, and check! Fast forward, you continue to lead all of the GE businesses through the strategy with the first one being, GE HealthCare! How? You lived their tagline every day be extraordinary, be curious, be bold! Now that GE HealthCare isn't tethered to a universal GE program, you are showing Ruth Nash, Kristin Hart, and Tatsuki Matsuyama all that's possible with the platform. The demo this week was SPOT ON! Getting them to imagine everything from a new program name to signal a change, to a new look/feel, experience, new features, making recognition easier, simpler, less steps and meaningful - the full power of the WH Cloud in action! It was thrilling seeing their eyes light up, the high level of engagement, questions and holding the attention for the full hour. That's hard to do with a group like GE HealthCare but not with you at the helm. Super impressive work! And what's more? This strategy is being played back to you as GE HealthCare is in the final stages of signing a renewal agreement in the next 60 days with a $10M annual investment that's going to be so much more in the months and years to come as they freely make decisions around program design, investment and high wattage of program communications. Talk about injecting a level of heartbeat into an organization! Super proud of you, Sheri! The dedication and passion is paying off! YOU ROCK!!\n\n55#Organizing Organon|Well done on an amazing meeting with Organon this week. Their laundry list of feature requests were no match to the knowledge, enthusiasm, and creativity of this team. Sheri, you did a marvelous job setting strong boundaries with them around the custom development we would (and wouldn't) discuss. Sherry, the solution you presented with the new flow showed empathy for their problem and and helped ground everyone with a solid understanding of our solution. Justin, despite just recently taking over reporting, you handled their reporting questions gracefully. Nuvs, you jumped in right in time with your deep understanding of the intricacies of the product.   Great job, team, on a great presentation! Cheers for a new (step forward with) Organon!\n\n56#Kicking off 2023 Right|Over the past month(s), all of you have been working diligently to build bold strategies to ensure we are best aligned to support our customers and have a solid plan for growth and increased investment.  This incredible group of humans showed up with brilliant ideas, a collaborative spirit and a passion that will no doubt bring success to Workhuman and our customers in 2023 and beyond.  It was two days’ worth of engaging dialog and commitment to find ways to move the needle, despite challenges and roadblocks that may be in our way.  We have solid plans to create even stronger relationships with Executives across our largest customers.  Next, a new renewals process to make our them even more impactful, engaging and successful. You also established a renewed sense of how to up level our Account Strategies to ensure we are always out front leading and bringing a proactive approach.  Our partnerships and alignment with our partners across WH are stronger than ever and I thank you all for leaning in as we are better together.  Cheers to each of you - a big thank you for bringing your best as it was so evident!\n\n57#Celebrating you all on Employee Appreciation Day!|I wanted to share with all of you how incredibly appreciative I am for all the work each of you do to support our largest customers here at Workhuman!  Leading the worlds biggest organizations to inspire and illuminate the good in their cultures is a massive responsibility and you all make it look effortless.  The varied strategies, passions and approaches you bring to the work you do is remarkable and so evident in the partnerships that you garner.  Thank you for your commitment to Workhuman and bringing the very best to our customers.  I hope that as we continue through 2023, you feel how valuable you are to me and the organization.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n58#E-comm Club FTW!|I want to thank each of you for your help over the past few weeks in making our e-comm session at Activate possible!  Sheri, Samar, and Mark - you did a fantastic job in the role-playing, adding your own flavor to each question and answer, and showcasing to the rest of the group how to have these difficult conversations with clients in a confident way.  We couldn't have done it without you!  Sarah - thank you for leading our session!  You gave a phenomenal overview of how e-comm fits into the recognition cycle and did an awesome job keeping the crowd engaged despite it being one of the last sessions of an eventful 2 days.  Jen - thank you for your guidance and support in planning this session!\n\n59#Landing the Big One!|Zoe, Leslie, Sheri, Steve and Chris, just an overdue award to recognize the amazing achievement of landing the Merck renewal! This one took a huge effort from many people, over an extended period of time. Of course, you would expect nothing less for the company's largest customer! It was a long, arduous road! Zoe, it must have been a baptism of fire for you to help shepherd this process at the final furlong! Sheri and Leslie, you continued to keep up the drumbeat and kept everyone internally on their toes to ensure we delivered a proposal that was acceptable. Chris and Steve, this was a tough negotiation and you found a way through it, protecting the company and in the process landing an extended - 5 year - deal! It took creativity and lateral thinking. Thank you all for this extraordinary achievement, together, you landed hundreds of millions of dollars of business for the company for the next half decade!\n\n60#Merck Renewal Magic|Sheri Riter - Where to even start with this incredible achievement!  You started planning for this renewal well over a year ago.  You set your strategy and worked every step, not ever wavering, building all of the details that truly mattered and were so confident in every aspect of this renewal.  There is an immense amount of pressure to manage Workhuman's largest client and to get a 5-year renewal in place is another level and truly remarkable!  Your executive relationships, both at Merck and here at Workhuman made all the difference, from the details that were shared, tackling new program managers, making them advocates and beyond.  It was amazing to be on this journey with you, to see how you lead procurement and knew every tiny detail, prepped to make sure that you were consistently one step ahead and finished incredibly strong.  Your dedication to Merck and this organization are so evident.  I agree with Steve Cromwell, this was the longest negotiation in the history of renewals.  I'm beyond proud of you Sheri and cheers to five more years of amazing partnership with Merck!\n\n61#Great Partnership and Teamwork!|Sheri, I'm not even sure where to begin, so I'll start by saying thank you for your tremendous partnership over the last couple of months (and all year for that matter).  Between Merck, GE, and Organon, we've had a pretty busy and crazy end of the year and you've been a great partner through it all.  Let's see, for Merck, you coordinated and led their semi-annual account review and made sure all the appropriate parties involved were on point with our messaging to the Executive Sponsor and program team.  Gathered the team to make sure we delivered 2 important 'Moments that Matter' to Merck.  And to cap it off, you've been deep into a renewal where we can finally see light at the end.   For Organon, there's too many items to list, but leading a successful QBR, coordinating countless meetings to discuss their product enhancements, bi-weekly check-ins with their exec sponsors, and another challenging renewal are just a few things going on with them. And let's not forget GE.  You're on top of everything we need as they prepare to spin-off into 3 different companies.  Your quarterly outreach to key stakeholders has brought a lot of energy and engagement into the program which has led to a number of gratitude summits.  I'm sure I left out a bunch of other accomplishments with these customers.  I can't thank you enough for your partnership and I really appreciate all your help and support.  Really looking forward to 2023 as we continue to move these customers forward in their journey.  Thank you!\n\n62#You were ON with Organon!|Sheri, for the last few months you have executed with grace through a challenging situation with a client who has pushed the bounds of the WHC into a new frontier; agile pay (Spot Awards) tied to Conversations (specifically awarded after a manager check-in with their direct report).  When the client gave us challenging feedback late Thursday during their renewal negotiation, you immediately stepped in leading our product, client, accounting and strategy teams to think as one unified team.  The vision, to deliver to the client exactly what they needed, which has changed the course of the renewal discussions with their leadership teams! You delivered to the Organon Talent and Rewards executives today with confidence and commitment; two things they needed to hear and feel to move forward.  Thank you for leading us through choppy waters and for challenging our teams to think outside the box with a true Respect to Customer approach.  Truly remarkable Leadership!  Leslie and Ro\n\n63#Bring the House Down|Sheri and Amanda - Knowing Christopher Cardarelli's love of theater, I had to steal a theater term to convey the amazing experience - truly a MOMENT THAT MATTERS in all caps - for his 25th anniversary with Merck. Sheri, you convened us back in the summer to ensure we did something amazing to commemorate this special occasion. Amanda - there were so many special touches you facilitated from the Tunde Oyeneyin cameo, signed book, the caricature, the video, it all came together in a big way. I can't say it better than Christopher himself:   \"On the drive home from my offsite today, I phoned my wife to tell her how much I could not wait to share the video you all sent to me.  She told me that two packages had just arrived for me.  We opened them together when I got home and honestly, she said to me, “Wow, they are so thoughtful and really seem to know you well!  I am blown away!  I am really digging the caricature full of images of things I enjoy so much – to cook, homemade pasta, Trader Joe’s, my little pooch Maya and a nice glass of wine!  The new pasta machine is over the top!  I hope one day we can all get to make some together – I would love that opportunity!  You all really made today very memorable for me!   Throughout the video, your words of appreciation and gratitude really made me blew me away.  The photos of moments that represent highlights of our work and fun together were awesome too!   I had Olivia and Dale watch the video with me and they felt so proud of and for me!  It really was an incredible moment to share with them!  My Olivia was so surprised and excited at Tunde’s message to me in the beginning only to freak out at the callout to her personally toward the end.  I cannot even describe Olivia’s reaction to the personalized message/signed copy of Tunde’s book – off the chart!    Thank you all so very much!  I feel so blessed to be connected to all of you and I look forward to 2023\"\n\n64#Excellence at Its Best!|I'm extremely proud of the determination you exemplified in our QBR session this week!  The profound dedication demonstrated across this team to outline and map how we can continue to deliver excellence to our customers was nothing short of incredible.  You all brought your biggest opportunities to the table to discuss how we can move them forward and identified what hurdles we need to overcome to bring them to fruition across the business.  I am always in awe to see how this group shows up for each other, helps to stretch each other’s thinking, helps to set a path towards achieving and exceeding what we need to deliver to our customers and to Workhuman.  Thank you all for your commitment to finish 2022 strong, while setting the bar high for 2023!\n\n65#Season of Giving Your All|This past week, all of you came together to share in the commitment to our customers, our company and each other!  It was so inspiring to see each and every one of you show up with passion and a desire to collectively learn from each other.  We spent time building momentum around how we unlock doors with executives, gaining full adoption of the Workhuman cloud, reaching new users on the platform, increasing investment and renewing our vows with longstanding customers.  The engagement that I saw when we discussed the roles everyone plays in supporting our customers, how you partner together and the achievements that have come from those partnerships was profound.  As we often hear, it takes a village - well I'm so PROUD to be a part of this village.  The commitment demonstrated in these sessions together is what makes us great and will continue to lead us into a bright 2023, no matter the challenges, we have each other!  In the spirit of the season of giving, thank you for giving it your all.  I look forward to more time together and a huge cheers to all of you!\n\n66#Amazing Team Effort|I just wanted to highlight the thoughtful planning and execution by this team that accumulated in into a very productive ADP account review. All our preparation paid off! The review took place on their exact anniversary of 7 years with Workhuman, purely coincidence but great timing.  Thank you to Shelly and the Workhuman practice team for putting together a well-designed slide and zoom background to celebrate.   Right off the bat, the program owner Trusha mentioned how appreciative she is of the many hands within Workhuman that provide support to their myMoment program. Trusha and Karen also provided the following feedback at the end of the review that they love how intuitive our product is and easy for employees to use (they've not heard any complaints from employees yet!). Additionally that it was very informative, full of \"ooo's and ah's, and are open to further program design enhancements and discussion. As a result we were able to get their buy-in to schedule a design lab to hopefully make some impactful changes to their program and to continue to expand our partnership.   Shoutouts go to Sherri for the impactful strategy discussion and thought leadership, Nuvs for highlighting our product integration and roadmap in a way that focused on ADP's needs, Morgan for diving into the details of our Workhuman cloud and the many functions it can provide, the Workhuman IQ team who told the ADP story and for which the customer was very appreciative of, and last but not least to Claire for all the assistance with helping me prep for my first account review!\n\n67#A Marathon of Gratitude!|Whew! Preparing this series of Gratitude Summits took a village! Erika, you walked with me through every step of this process to ensure we were delivering well written, quality content to one of our most admired customers. Melissa, as always, you worked diligently to ensure that our trainings were beautifully designed and pulled together some customized slides for our audience on a dime. Lauren and Jessica, both of you partnered with me in advance to help me practice my delivery and maximize the use of our technologies to deliver a seamless experience for our customers on the day of the presentation. Maura, a special thank you to you for jumping in to help us make the Gratitude Summit a fun and interactive experience for each and every one of our participants. Alan, your partnership in providing business specific data really helped us customize our content for the audience. And Sheri, thank you for your partnership in prepping and delivering a fantastic, engaging, and mindset shifting presentation to the LATAM HR Leadership at GE. I can't wait to do it again over the next couple of weeks!  Thank you all, so, so much for everything you did to make this series a success! These summits are truly helping our customers get their gratitude attitudes on, shift their mindset towards and see the value in smaller, more frequent awards. It was amazing to see them get excited about how to maximize the recognition experience across all of the businesses at GE and we couldn't have done it without each and every one of you.  THANK YOU!!!\n\n68#So Grateful for all of You!|I can’t even begin to put into words how fortunate I feel to get to work with this incredibly talented group of amazing humans! You inspire me, our customers and all that have the privilege of working with you here at Workhuman. Your fierce determination and commitment to bringing the best to your roles everyday is unparalleled. You make my heart so full by being uniquely you and I am so lucky to have a front row seat to all you accomplish every single day! Cheers to you all!\n\n69#The Power of Partnerships!|WOW!! Just WOW!! Sheri, the Queen of Creating Opportunities & Expanding Partnerships! You did once again with Merck. Your day in and day out approach to leading from the front with Merck continues to pay off in spades. It's obvious to Merck you are OBSESSED with their success, are accountable, transparent, infuse Inspire into all facets of their Total Rewards strategy and connect all of the dots for them. No better testament than today's \"ask\" from Christopher Cardarelli and Merck's DE&I team. This month the Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Extended HR Leadership team organized a month long series of webinars to support key topics employees are most interested in. Christopher immediately thought to pair Workhuman with Merck's pay equity team and create a Power of Equitable and Inclusive Rewards webinar to kick off the month long series. Bam!! The curated content, a slice of the Gratitude Summit, married perfectly with the pay equity topic. Gratitude and Recognition I'd say actually stole the show. Most of the Q&A questions centered around wanting more best practices, advise, how to's on Inspire and recognizing others! The frequency of recognition stuck a cord! It's because of the strong relationships built these opportunities surface and present themselves! You were a STELLAR presenter and had the audience hanging on your every word. Christopher texted me directly after the session and said \"That was phenomenal.\" High praise!! He listens to Merck execs all day long!  WAHOO!! Joyce, your name and Merck go hand in hand. You have been Merck's primary consultant post launch and integral to the success in the last 5 years. Thanks for your support in today's session and all of your contributions and achievements. An Inspire moments happens every 23 seconds in a company the size of Merck! Think about that stat!! That's a lot of inspiring and infusing recognition into the DNA of the culture. You both are ROCK STARS!!!\n\n70#Gratitude Attitude Queens|Traci and Sheri, I'm fresh off the world-class Gratitude summit you presented for more than 350 Merck employees and still feeling energized by the experience! Leveraging the deep partnership with Christopher, you were able to provide the positive foundation to their discussion on rewards at Merck, talk of the deep impact INSPIRE has had over the past five years, and keep up the energy with this diverse audience. While your speaking efforts and championing of INSPIRE seemed effortless, I know it took of hours of refining the approach with Christopher as well as several test sessions to ensure the seamless experience that Merck employees got to view today. Not only that, there were many hard-hitting questions regarding the other topic presented - pay equity - and the Merck team relied heavily on you two to answer the organic questions coming in from employees to help keep the webinar on track and ending on a high note. It is always a pleasure to witness the two of you as a dynamic duo in action, especially for one of our most strategic clients. Let the reign of Gratitude Attitudes continue!\n\n71#Bravo to you!|Sheri - Thank you for everything you did to prepare and present during the BMS QBR.  As this was our 1st QBR (well, first half review really!), we were learning the requirements and designing the flow for the first time.  We delivered a powerful and content-rich QBR that was really well received by our stakeholders.  You always bring such a refreshing perspective and strategic eye to meetings with this customer, and I can tell they pay attention and respect your guidance so much.  Thank you for being a great partner and making this first \"QBR\" a huge success.  Onward!\n\n72#QBRzzzzzzz|This team has finally grown to the point that we’ve outpaced the Teams screen! It was wonderful to welcome Gardner and Janet in person! Thank you each for bringing your very thorough and thoughtful action plans along with ‘visual aids’ to share over the last 2 lonnnnng dayz! We focused on what you’ve identified for the final few months of 2022 and it was incredible to hear about your progress and your dream scenarios. Im always so impressed by the brain power that exists on the team and the level of ‘yes, and..’ that happens when we come together. Special shout out to Leslie, Rebecca, Abby, and the Goat, Traci P for bringing us thoughtful process and useful air cover and unique collateral to help us focus on Team Awards, Multiple Programs, and Renewals. Lets do this ‘Season of Giving’ the way we know how!\n\n73#Celebrating Celeste!|Sheri, its such an inspiration to watch you work. You’re a master relationship builder. The masterful part is the authenticity. The absolute delight with which we were received in Philly this week by our partners at Merck is truly a testament to your magical self. Not everyone is invited over for dinner at Christophers home! Thank you for your commitment to creating intentional magical moments with our customers and celebrating them uniquely. Celeste Warren’s book launch support is just another example of your thoughtful approach to growing and securing our business. Brava!\n\n74#A spirit of renewal|Sheri, I was reflecting on the week just now and on the great work you have been doing these past few weeks in aligning the company to put us in the best place for the Merck renewal. In truth, it has been years of work preparing for this moment but I wanted to particularly highlight your work in the past few weeks. There are so many moving pieces, coaches, initiatives, fires and amazing data to consider and you are like a chess master planning all the right moves.  We're so lucky to have you leading the strategy.  Thank you!\n\n75#Hang in there, You're doing AMAZING!|All, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the incredible work this team is doing everyday to support our largest customers!  I am beyond proud of each and every single one of you.  The value you each are bringing this organization and our clients is beyond measure.  It is a distinct privilege to get to see you in action, listen to your strategies to support our customers in all the right ways and see you succeed day after day.  It has been a rough go for a while now for a myriad of reasons and you all are absolute warriors.  You inspire and humble me with the creativity, fortitude and determination you all demonstrate.  Thank you for being uniquely you and for the contributions you bring to our customers and Workhuman.  Bravo!\n\n76#First Inclusion Advisor case study!|To this core team, kudos for getting this case study over the finish line. Sheri, for being the partner, mentor and team player that Merck trusts to tell our story and continues to approve our materials. Sarah and Sarah - your drafts and foundational work was vital to bringing this story to life. Abby, for bringing this over the finish line. This is huge for our business, across all teams. Thank you so much!\n\n77#It takes a Workhuman village! (part 2)|Last week was the culmination of the efforts by so many to bring the Executive Forum to life at Workhuman Live. Joining the team only 6 weeks before the event, I was blown away by the work ethic, camaraderie, and creativity of everyone involved. Your support, encouragement, and tireless commitment to the finished product (both during the final stretch of planning and onsite) far exceeded anything I could have ever imagined in a team, and your efforts were instrumental in delivering an impactful program for ExF members. Thank you for bringing the vision to life. It was a sincere pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.  With the craziness of the event, I fell a bit behind with recognition in the final 2 weeks leading up to the event. Please know - your contributions did not go unnoticed.   SCDs and Sales Teams – for your diligent efforts to fill the room and empower the most important Customers and Prospects to join the conversation. These efforts not only contributed to the success of this event, they also helped lay the foundation for future events and further development of our business relationships.   Meghan, Chris W, and Dave – for your diligent work facilitating and tracking customer experience and the growth account participation. I appreciate your keen eyes on the process!   Corina and Dana – for your collaborative efforts in integrating the Partner Program elements into the ExF experience and for your timely action in helping to lock in details ahead of our internal deadlines. Also, for your leadership and companionship as co-hosts of the Bellyard breakfasts and enthusiasm throughout the onsite experience. Your input during the breakfast conversations added real value to the attendees’ experiences. It was a delight to watch you in action!  With tremendous thanks for your involvement and contribution to this process – congratulations on a job well done! Onward to Dublin!\n\n78#WHL Strategic Accounts Team Success|HOTLANTA! Well done to this team of fabulous people! We got to reunite with old friends, new friends, and each other! You worked tirelessly to get the right customers to attend and really engage with us and it really paid off. I was so proud watching you all connect with our customers and see how proud they were to be hosted by you! Each of the customer speaking sessions was FAB! Mike Malloy could hardly contain himself—he may want a fulltime gig! Even GE was beaming! So many customers from so many accounts—many first timers! You all worked your tails off to be sure every customer felt great about their experience and managed to unearth some new insights and opportunities! Well done to each of you and to this fantastic team. You show up for each other and for customers in the very best way…every time. Cheers!!\n\n79#Micro-Coaching Power Panel|Shout out to Sheri and Corbrina for facilitating and participating in a fantastic panel with Merck at Workhuman Live. The care and thought you put into the prep really showed throughout a the highly engaging and powerful session. There has been a transition in our contacts at Merck, which is never easy. After the panel, our newest customer contact said that she had been feeling on the outside of the Workhuman team, and now she feels fully involved and was really happy to be part of it. Thank you both for helping Merck shine at Workhuman Live!!\n\n80#Inspiring Hearts and Minds at Organon|Sheri  - I am simply going to let the words sent directly to you from CHRO, Aaron Falcione do all the talking! \"Hi Sheri, thank you for being such a great host this week.  I didn't get the chance to fully express how much I've come to appreciate the partnership we are forming with Workhuman.  It's rare to find a team and an organization with such strong philosophical alignment.  Beyond that, I feel that you and the entire team are committed to our success and I've been at this game long enough to know how rare and special that is.  I look forward to building something special together at Organon.  It may sound a bit trite, but I sincerely believe that women around the world are counting on us and I'm happy that Workhuman is part of that mission.  Have a great rest of the week!! Aaron\"\n\n81#Bravo for 2021 Account Review Success!|Thank you to each one of you for an amazingly successful BMS Account Review.  Sheri - Thank you for always being a partner to me during the creation and planning of these reviews, and on the broader account too. The clients love hearing from you and know that your input and guidance is key to a successful program.  Danielle - I always appreciate our laughs while getting the slide layout ready.  You have such a depth of comms knowledge and strategy to share, and BMS really should just listen to it all.  Team Awards.... I can smell them coming!  Melissa - your polish and editing skills are unmatched.  Thank you for listening to what was needed and delivering it.   Alan - our WHIQ voice who brings the insights that BMS eats up.  Your deep dive into Ovation awards was welcomed and eye opening for certain.  Thank you for knowing this client so intimately and bringing eyebrow-raising content that truly engages the group.  Rick - You are always a wonderful partner to me and certainly to BMS as well.  e-Commerce is always on their mind with a specific focus this year into sustainability.  I appreciate your genuine care to share what your team has done and is doing this year to enhance the user experience and expand the reach of the Store. Adam - your first time joining the BMS Review gang and you crushed it, of course!  Thank you for waiting out nearly 2 hours of intense conversation to share your Product future state.  The team at BMS was completely intrigued!  Without this team, our Review would not have been nearly as impactful and interesting.  Thank you for all of your time and effort.\n\n82#Continuous Improvement|Thank you for sharing your feedback on our Organon retrospect this morning. Change isn't easy, but if it's to improve our customer's experience and Workhuman's advancement, it's all worth it. As we learn together, we grow together.\n\n83#Talk. Recognize. Reward. is Here!|To the incredible humans behind the Organon launch, Thank you!!! When I joined there was about less than a month until go live. Mark, you helped answer my many questions. Specifically, on how to make this launch impactful, not only to the core project team but to all founders. We adjusted the project plans and launch dates to achieve all items in this customers' scope of work. Joyce and Kim provided Organon teams with ample guidance and training materials. Ro and Sheri thank you so visionary with this launch Organon. Not only considering the benefit for Organon with Thrive but the influence this could have on other WH customers.  I'm eager to see the effects of this program in the upcoming months.  It is your dedication and expertise that led us to the finish line. There would be no Talk. Recognize. Reward. without you. Congratulations team!\n\n84#All Hands on Deck|Huge THANK YOU to Peter, Brendan, Enda, Robert, Luka, Sheri, Chris, Mark and Amy for your support this weekend. Organon asked for urgent modifications to their program site for the soft launch on Monday morning. Each of you lent a hand in either coordinating with internal teams, updating scripts, running data loads and hot deploys, enabling the DKIM for their new email address, and performing testing in sandbox and production. Your efforts will not go unmissed by the Organon team.  Talk. Recognize. Reward. is now setup for success!\n\n85#Quality is key!|I wanted to thank you all for your help in providing honest/ constructive feedback on our global account marketing materials. As we move into Q2, its important that we continue working as a team to create materials that provide the most value to our customers. Thank you for your continued partnership!\n\n86#GE - Building a World that Works! (Magic, People)|To quote GE's slogan \"Building a world that works\" - THIS TEAM takes it even further in supporting GE in building a world and employee experience that works, energizes, inspires and retains talent! Sheri! Oh, Sheri!! You made today's Strategic Review session possible. You have built such a trusted relationship with Tatsuki Matsuyama and Ellie Bartow and bam, secured this strategic meeting after a 4+ years drought! I've got to watch in awe as you have masterfully blended inspiring the GE and being inspired yourself to help support them with a massive company change moving from a single company into three separate companies in the next two years! Incredible, strategic and detailed work to get the mindset change, GE aligned with smaller value awards given more frequently, enable the company newsfeed across all business groups, leverage the platform as a communications tool and showcase the ROI of the Impact program - a program that's making a big difference! Alan, you brought the data to support the strategic direction in which the mindset, skill set and program design set needs to change in order to maximize GE's investment and proved with \"ah ha\" moments recognition is a super effective lever for creating connections and retaining talent! Tatsuki was hanging on your every word! Mark, you took over as the Senior Customer Success manager and haven't missed a beat. GE is very complex, has multiple key business groups, with multiple programs, eligibility rules and you make it all seem very simple and easy to manage! I love seeing the GE team smile and nod their heads when you're presenting. Super engaging and speaks volumes to the partnership you have created. Adam, sharing the product roadmap and the vision of the future brought fruitful conversation and GE's very interested in learning more about Workday integrations and being a pilot for Team Awards! Huge wins!!! You all are an inspiration to GE and me!!! You Rock!!\n\n87#Strong relationships lead to great things!|Sheri,  Thank you for (re)introducing us to our latest hire within the Customer Success team!   Over the years, you’ve forged such strong relationships with our customers that you’ve been able to deliver excellence to them while growing their programs.  In this case, a longtime Customer Program Lead had left the customer and later sought you out to see if Workhuman could be their next professional home.  You got him excited about the possibility and got us quick introductions.  A few weeks later and we’ve closed him on joining us this month.  Without your relationship with him, we might never have known this was a possibility.  Thank you for having such a great relationship with him and helping him navigate to his role and partnering with us to build the team!   Dave\n\n88#Q1 QBRs: a Fresh New Year!|A 2 week-er! As we 'wrap up' QBRs for the first quarter of 2022, I want to thank you for your deep discovery work and preparation. We started with a week long deep dive account by account to get us all level set on our current footing. It was a very intense week and I so appreciate you all being so prepared and professional! We then gathered in my city by the Bay for another few days of collaboration, ideation, and BIG idea sharing. What a fantastic few days! Thank you for your commitment to this process, for showing up with your whole selves, for being supportive and encouraging of each other, and for making me laugh so much. I'm so proud of the work we're doing together and always SO happy to see you all in person. (I'm also super grateful that Erika's house is Covid-free! We missed your presence physically but we felt your presence virtually!) Safe travels home and happy weekend! #bestteamevah\n\n89#The BEST team on the Planet!|You all are a team of fierce, focused and determined humans!  I am so thankful to have a front row seat to watch you pouring your heart into all that you do to support our customers and grow the business for Workhuman.  Each of you inspires me beyond measure.  The work you all do everyday is challenging and hard and you make it look effortless.  You are truly moving mountains and I couldn't be more proud of you all. Thank you for being uniquely you!\n\n90#Making the Remarkable Happen|Sheri,  In the spirit of Innovation = Imagination + Determination, the work you have done exemplifies this Workhuman Value.  You have done incredible work bringing Gratitude Summits to so many of your largest customers – Merck, GE, ADP, Harman and Synchrony to name a few - which have significantly led to new executive relationships, increases in program activity and amplified awareness and ROI around the power of Gratitude and Recognition. Not only were you spreading Gratitude across organizations, you then brought out the best in their cultures by working with them to illuminate and promote Inclusiveness at both Merck and ADP.  In Merck’s case, they were just honored and awarded the Brandon Hall Excellence Award! Merck won Gold in “Best Advance in Rewards and Recognition Technology” for their company’s outstanding Workhuman Social Recognition program, INSPIRE, and the implementation of Inclusion Advisor to foster a more diverse and equitable workplace. AMAZING!!  Additionally, no small feat to bring all of this gratitude and inclusiveness to your customers, but you also recently signed a new 3-year Renewal with GE and secured the remainder of the WH Cloud for Organon in the last 2 weeks.  And to put a bow on it all, you brought Eric to the CHRO and his leadership team at GE in an innovative strategy session to have him say, “I never got how important recognition was until now!”  Beyond epic work Sheri!  You are such a star and I am beyond proud of your accomplishments and can’t wait to see what you crush in 2022!\n\n91#And, we're off!|This team had one heck of a year and they're already out of the starting gate to take on 2022! We're 14 days in and I am so inspired by the determination and planning that has lead to a LOT of strategic meetings already. We've already closed 2 more huge customers on the Inclusion Advisor, have Gratitude Summits underway---and a backlog of demand!, and have identified major opportunities with steps toward closing them. Congratulations on a great start to a fresh new year. Please hydrate!\n\n92#Bring on 2022!|What a group of inspirational and determined people all of you are!  In our time together this week at our QBRs, we focused on our vision and commitment to success in 2022.  I was blown away by the commitment and passion each of you demonstrated to continue to drive for the very best experience for our customers.  That in turn means, we will be driving for the very best for Workhuman.  2021 has been a challenging year in so many ways, both personally and professionally for each of you and the grit and fortitude you all demonstrate on a daily basis is unparalleled.  You all have blown your Moonshots out of the water and have continued to drive this business forward against many challenges.  The integrity and spirit of delivering the best experience for our customers, their culture and their employees is what continues to drive our success here as we continue to see more recognition happening at our largest customers.  You all are the lifeblood and I’m so proud to work alongside each of you.  Cheers!\n\n93#Thankful for You|This is the time of year where everyone is rushing toward the 'finish line'--literally pushing themselves and each other toward another year of record breaking performance. It's the crush of renewal season, always a bit stressful and uncertain until the deals are done. Thank you for hanging in there for each other and acting with integrity and professionalism. I'm so thankful to work with each of you! Wishing you a beautiful long weekend with your family and friends. On to December! Gobble Gobble!\n\n94#GE HRLT Summit Presentation|Thank you all so much for all your work on my presentation to the GE HR leadership team meeting. The stakes were high - they are a top customer, we've worked with them for 15 years, they know HR and are a very experienced team. They've been there and seen it all! It didn't help that a loose Q&A turned into a half hour presentation - with not much notice. But you guys rallied and the slides were perfect and we were able to meet their very defined messaging needs !! It went great because of you. Thank you!\n\n95#Customer Strategy People and Culture Offsite|Thank you so much for your participation and contributions at our recent Customer Strategy People and Culture offsite.  With our work environment changing so radically and the personal stress mounting, you all volunteered to be part of the solution.  You came with open minds and a solution-oriented outlook to address the main feedback areas on behalf of your respective team members.  From video communications and updated team rhythms to self-care habits and cross-departmental relations, your ideas sprung forth into actionable plans.  I can't wait for your peers to hear about them.  Thank you not only for the great work but for the positive attitude and growth mindset you brought to the discussions.  I'm very grateful to be on this journey alongside such caring teammates.\n\n96#Customer Newsletter|Sheri, we just finished recording the Spotlight summary newsletter for customers and you did such a wonderful job as a guest speaker.  It is clear that you are an expert on building culture at large organizations and your insights on the journey at Organon and other customers were spot on.  The delivery was smooth and polished.  Thank you for all the work preparing for this and for delivering a great performance on the day.  Well done!\n\n97#Teamwork makes the dream work!|Sheri and Chris, thank you both so much for your great work on the post WH Spotlight recap video for our customers. It's no easy feat distilling 75 minutes into 8! This video is jammed packed with takeaways and actionable insights. Personally, really enjoyed the back and forth fireside chat format as well; its going to be our best video yet. Greatly appreciate the time, preparation and willingness to try something new. Cheers to you both!\n\n98#A very special moment that matters|Team! Thank you all for your participation in our special retirement book and gift for Diane Abbriano at New York Life.  Diane has been a long standing champion of Workhuman and will be retiring at the end of this week.  Diane brought the Applause program to life and has been overseeing the program for over 6 years.  Huge shout out to the experience team (Chris, Amanda and Meghan) for the amazing idea and bringing it to life!  We gathered messages from Workhuman colleagues that have worked with Diane over the years as well as internal New York Life team members to create a special send off to this next exciting chapter of retirement!  Here is the note from Diane after receiving the gift: Thank you for the most thoughtful gift!  It was a nice surprise.  Actually, it was more than nice, it was amazing.  I have received many letters of congratulations and some beautiful gifts, but I couldn’t wait to share this book with my family because it was so heartfelt and personal.  From the first time I met with Tom Vitkofsky, Workhuman became part of my extended work family.  I could not have launched Applause and made it a success if it weren’t for Lynette, Mark, Chris, Lauren, Sheri, Martin and the rest of the Workhuman superstars who were always there to support us.  Please pass along my thanks to this terrific group of humans! --- This clearly made an impact and it would not have been as meaningful without all of your help and participation, thank you!\n\n99#Gratitude for your FIRE!|To this incredible team of pros, I hope you are dancing alongside me (virtually) to our theme song! You are the Fire in the band! How lucky are we all to work together and make work for millions of people centered in gratitude?! I'm grateful for each of you every day and inspired by your passion, drive, and leadership. Dance a little, sing a little, and feel celebrated---Never was a cloudy day!\n\n100#Bursting with Gratitude!|To this magnificent group of remarkable leaders, I wanted to share with you the gratitude I feel for all of you every single day.  Each of you brings a unique point of view and inspiring ways you’re leading our customers into the future.  I can’t imagine this journey without any of you.  My heart is overflowing with gratitude that I get the opportunity to work alongside you, learn from you, laugh with you, swear with you and be inspired by you.  Never have I ever worked with a more talented group of humans.  Thank you for being you!!!\n\n101#Transforming the Future|This team is beyond INCREDIBLE and the TRUE DREAM TEAM!  As I think about the future of where Workhuman is going and the experiences we are working diligently to create in partnership with our customers, knowing all of you are leading the way makes me beyond proud.  We spent an incredible couple of days together leveraging our 'Empire State of Strategic Minds\" and worked with determination and passion to identify, align and set a path forward for what is next, how to get there, and take us well beyond a $1B company during our QBR session.  The level of strategic thinking, passion and determination you all demonstrated was truly inspiring.  The transformative strategy you all have outlined is what is going to move us forward in all the best ways with focus on our customers digital transformation, sustainability, agility, inclusion and equity efforts and beyond.  I can’t wait to see where the vision takes this team and the relationships you have built. Amazing work team!\n\n102#Beautiful filming and video outcome for Merck|Thank you all for creating such an amazing video for Merck. You created an inspiring narrative, went onsite, managed the recording and created a masterpiece out of it. Thank you! The words from the client speak volumes: Wow – just wow!  I cannot thank you enough for the support and encouragement.  I am normally super critical of myself but have to say this is something I am really proud of!\n\n103#Simply the best!|Sheri- the award title here really says it all! But to elaborate, you continue to be such an amazing coach/mentor/colleague despite the fact that we do not have one specific account that we work together on anymore. When we were experiencing some challenges with Hershey, you jumped right in to coach,  provide some recommendations on how to address the challenge, and even offered and joined a call with the customer to ensure we were best prepared to deliver. Fast forward maybe 2 weeks, and I brought to you another challenge/opportunity with Fannie Mae's RFP, with the intent to walk you through my thought process/what I was putting together/get your suggestions based on your experience with them if there was anything else I should be doing. You not only helped me brainstorm an approach, but you are taking it many steps further by reaching out to your contacts to gain more insight, while also joining a conversation with their Procurement Team to help move forward in the right direction with this RFP.  I always learn so much from you, and always laugh a lot in the process which makes it even better!! Thank you for always being a great resource to leverage, and sharing your knowledge and expertise with me to help me grow! As my title of this award said, you are simply the best!!\n\n104#Making Magic at Merck|Team, it’s been an exciting journey launching Inclusion Advisor with Merck. In the past few months, we’ve worked closely with them to get a presentation proposal about our IA partnership created AND accepted for World at Work. Cue months of careful planning to get to this point in the journey, when we’re invited onsite to record their presentation. Beyond that, their glowing words on their recognition experience, the impact on their employees, and their advocation of IA, the list goes on and on. As we watched Michaela and Christopher present today, it was pure magic. Our clients speaking authentically about our partnership and they’re so grateful for the support they received. Don’t just take my word for it, Michaela and Christopher wanted to thank you personally since they couldnt recognize you directly through their own INSPIRE program.\n\n105#What slowdown?|Team fab. Every week I read your Strategic Insights and am blown away. It's actually a challenge to summarize the incredible work you are doing. Week after week, you are outdoing yourselves. The work that is happening today is work that we were only dreaming about a few years ago! You are truly setting a new bar weekly for us and forcing us to think bigger and bigger as an organization. Thank you for the work you are doing daily, conversation to conversation, meeting to meeting, internally and externally to make incredible things happen. And it's not just the work with customers, the collaboration and teamwork that you demonstrate every day makes me super proud. Thank you and Bravo!\n\n106#Creating a moment for Biogen|Team, great work celebrating the incredible 15 years Biogen has been a Workhuman customer.  The thoughtful video you created helped to share a moment that mattered with the broader Biogen team.  Having any customer for 15 years requires a number of folks rowing in the right direction, clearing obstacles, pushing new initiatives forward and delighting the customer consistently.  Amazing job formulating a plan and then executing with excellence for the customer.  Well done to all!\n\n107#Integrating me to the SCD Team!|One month in and I have had such productive one on one conversations with each of the broader SCD team including also Traci and Becky.  Thank you to everyone for being such a productive, positive and meaningful addition to my onboarding.  There is so much to learn from all of  you and I am so thrilled to be a part of this team.  Thanks for leaning in and helping me get up to speed!\n\n108#Valuable Feedback|I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for taking the time to join my Roundtable session to introduce yourselves and spend sometime providing me with helpful context and feedback about your time at Workhuman - everything you shared was very helpful for me learning the business and looking for areas to quickly add value. I so look forward to our continued partnership!\n\n109#They said, \"Yes!\"|Alice, Sheri, Chris - thank you for your partnership and persistent efforts to identify and secure a keynote customer interview for our October Spotlight Broadcast. Very exciting to know that Aaron Falcione, Chief Human Resources Officer at Organon & Co will be our featured customer interview. With gratitude, -C\n\n110#2H Global Marketing Plans|Team, I just wanted to thank everyone for their hard work and input on our 2H 2021 global marketing plans. I really appreciated all the thoughtful feedback and help along the way, very excited to get these into action!\n\n111#Taking time for Discovery!|All! Thank you so much for taking time out of your very busy days to participate in discovery calls for the customer database growth and governance project. Everyone offered terrific perspective and helped the team get a well rounded view of the current process and areas or opportunity. Excited to share the findings more broadly and appreciate you all!\n\n112#Sheri, Wamby, and Jay to the Rescue|Sheri, Jay, Wamby, thank you for jumping in to produce a beautiful clip that brings to power of Inclusion Advisor to the forefront. I know Eric is excited to share the impact the Inclusion Advisor is having!  Your willingness work quickly through teamwork and a total dedication to quality has left me in awe!\n\n113#Hiring@Workhuman - Training Success!|Congratulations and thank you to each of you for participating in our Hiring@Workhuman trainings over the last few weeks! The sessions are a big undertaking and a large amount of time and we greatly appreciate your putting interviewing at the top of your priority list! We appreciate the discussions, the excellent questions and the breakout session practice. We hope you walk away feeling armed to tackle interviewing at Workhuman! Thank you for your time, participation and support!\n\n114#Global Account QBRs—Synergies!|Super excited after our two day meeting (i mean, with the time change, it was days right?)! You all brought your A game and applied the WH ‘MRI’ machine (T Pesch trademark) to our 6 biggest opportunites. We have so much great trouble to get into! Thank you for your energy, professionalism, creativity, ... but mostly for your teamwork and collaboration. I love this oportunity we have to focus and drive big growth.  The impact to the business is gonna be huuuuuge. Bravo!\n\n115#Making Sparks Fly|Huge THANK YOU to all of you for an incredible Quarterly Business Meeting today!  We could have spent the entire 3 hours celebrating all of the amazing work you all are doing. You all are the visionaries leading our customers into the Future of Work and helping them to build cultures that celebrate their employees.  The work you’re doing is fundamentally inspiring employees to feel valued, included and recognized for their contributions and unique perspectives.  As we continue to drive towards our goals for the second half of the year, I am certain we will continue to make sparks fly in all the right ways.  Your dedication and passion for the work we do is unprecedented and so evident in all you deliver.  I continue to be blown away by the talent each of you bring and can’t thank you enough for everything you do to support our customers.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n116#Way to GEt it Done!|This AMAZING team of incredible people have successfully moved GE into another 3 Year renewal!  You all have been facing in impending RFP for quite some time and due to all of your determination and perseverance, have made it look easy for Phil Morgan to say, “I’m Happy and lets just sign for another three years… just send over the paperwork”.  Each of you has played an integral role in keeping this longstanding, not so easy to please mega customer engaged with Workhuman.  You have worked hard to continue to build incredible trust, restore happiness and inspire a bright future together in the partnership.  2020 brought so many ups and downs across different businesses at GE and you all maneuvered through it all with remarkable grace and fortitude.  This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Vincent Van Gogh, “Great things are done by a series of small things brough together”. In GE’s case, small things brought together include Strategy Sessions for their 4 IFGs, getting leadership to see the importance of recognition, regaining momentum, supporting GE’s tough eCommerce requests, aligning the IMPACT program to key IFG initiatives like Leadership Principles and building executive relationships with the likes of Laura Cococcia, Head of HR Strategy and Program Management, who’s partnering with us to build out GE’s HR development forums. She’s using words like “It would be impactful to have Eric and Kevin (CHRO of GE) do a fireside chat on the future of work.” These are game changing statements and only possible through all of the small things, initiatives, sweat and tears over the years! I’m so proud of each and every one of you for making an IMPACT on GE, our company and our movement! It takes a village and the Workhuman villagers are unstoppable!!\n\n117#Trailblazing Again at Merck|To those who Inspire: Sheri, Traci, Joyce, Mark and Nuvs - You INSPIRE Merck, your teams and our company in the extraordinary ways you show up, collaborate and partner with our customers! Talk about modeling our value of Respect for Customers and living the definition of “building strong relationships and delivering customer-centric solutions and experiences. Consciously creating “moments that matter” in a systemic and scalable way! You were the Trailblazers with Merck and our new Inclusion Advisor tool. Your imagination, determination and passion for building human-centered workplaces is contagious. Week after week, this core project team collaborated with the Merck team to define and deliver on these new capabilities to a pilot group of about 700 employees. It was hard, challenging and filled with lots of sensitivities and nuances that absolutely needed to be 110% right. You tireless efforts are paying off in spades. First, Celeste Warren, CDO will be speaking not once but twice at WHLO talking about diversity and inclusion and how it intersects with recognition. And at Merck, recognition is happening every 45 seconds. Second, Merck confirmed they see tremendous value in the Inclusion Advisor tool and are ready to expand to all US employees – 26,000+ employees and third, Michaela asked this WH team if we’d be interested in co-presenting on recognition and it’s intersection with DE&I at the upcoming World at Work conference this October. As a practitioner, she’ll make the submission through Merck. And if that wasn’t thrilling enough, the Merck core team got a shout out by their CEO at an internal all hands for the work they are doing to support Merck’s key initiatives. Talk about INSPIRING!! Thank you all for being brave, innovative and dedicated to making Merck and others soon, a place where everyone feels they work at and contribute to a thriving human-centered workplace.\n\n118#GE vision|Sheri, Today you found out that all of the many months of strategizing, coaxing, selling, marketing and relationship leveraging at GE has paid off and once again they have opted out of an RFP process into a renewal discussion. It has been over 10 years since they did an RFP and last year they were convinced that it was a procurement imperative. But you have been sowing seeds for years with gratitude summits, offsite meetings at Workhuman Live and many, many hours of executive outreach, education and discussions. Pair that with helping them realize the true value of what they are getting from the Workhuman partnership proactively, socially surrounding them with targeted marketing and custom messaging and Voila! Here we are. I’m so grateful that you have been leading this jouney for us. On behalf of all of us, thank you for your dedication and leadership. Well done!\n\n119#Sometimes all you need is human's name|When working on the design of our Periscope survey, Sheri asked if we could add end user name before an actual survey question. This is a feature that we, despite being Survey design and Insight wizards, completely forgot about! We agreed that it was a great idea to personalise the question and subsequent benchmark analysis showed that personalisation can increase response rates up to 2.5 times!! This means a) faster data collection and b) smaller audiences can be targeted within our surveys leading to more agile and versatile Insights. This story shows the importance of working together. We shouldn't over rely on your knowledge and experience... People that wear different hats than us, can bring new ideas outside of our comfort zone yielding better quality and more customer centric outputs. Thank you Sheri for helping us improving our surveys!!!\n\n120#You are INSPIRING both Merck AND Organon!|Sheri,  This message is on behalf of me and Mark, I think we've been in eight meetings alone this week related to Merck and Organon. I wanted to call out specifically how artfully the crossover between these two influential clients crystalized in two distinct moments this week, due to the your strategic guidance.  First, a lot of careful preparation was needed for Merck's annual review meeting this week as we faced a time crunch and a delicate balance of focusing on Merck's program performance while also acknowledging the Organon attendees. You worked through the right approach with our team and outreach to Peter, and what resulted was a jam-packed meeting where Jeff and Aaron as executive sponsors spoke highly of our partnership and impact of INSPIRE, with Aaron telling how how powerful he found it and the reason he  wants to focus on it to stand up the culture at Organon. The other Organon attendees chimed in and spoke glowingly of our relationship and understanding the \"art of the possible\" with their new program. Second, we had a financial overview meeting with Organon today to go over contract costs as well as the costs associated with adding new cloud elements. Not the most exciting meeting topic on the surface but I was blown away when Peter kicked off the meeting for a recognition moment FOR US! He congratulated us on hosting a great meeting, and called out specifically how pleased Jeff and Aaron were. Mariel added that not all parts of Organon's implementation are going well but working with Workhuman is \"optimal,\" \"what teamwork looks like,\" and that our hard work \"is very much noticed\". Two pleased executive sponsors (and new CHRO)? Check. Two pleased PMs? Check! Two pleased project teams that were shown in the best light in front of their leaders? Check.  Soon to be launched client trusting our advice and actively seeking to implement new products? Check. No limits to what you can achieve? Happy Check Ten!\n\n121#Igniting a more Inclusive and Diverse World!|Sheri,  Living our Value – Innovation = Imagination + Determination, you have once again sparked the future of possibilities and translated them into breakthrough strategies!  Not only did you get Merck to be the first customer piloting the Inclusion Advisor, you now have taken it one step further and have gotten the CDO to speak at the WHLO conference!  These relationships are built on meaningful work and through lots of trust, which you have earned in spades at Merck.  Plus, now you have the CHRO of Organon, the spinoff from Merck, wanting to raise the bar even higher. He has agreed to be on the CXO panel at WHLO and can’t wait to be setting new bars with you and Workhuman.  Truly remarkable focus and partnership as you have been leading the Merck team to greatness for a long time now.  You just keep taking it up notch after notch, which is no easy feat with Merck.  Way to go Sheri, you really are the Spahk!\n\n122#Always Ready!|Congrats and well done to this powerhouse team of Strategic Leaders on a blowout Q1! Your hard work and always ready mentality has proven to be our secret weapon. Every week I see you making major chess moves with our Strategic Accounts and teeing us up to win big. So many congratulations on the first of many successful quarters in 2021. Super proud of each of you and your new fabulous leader! Rock on!\n\n123#Partnership and Leadership at it's Finest|Sheri, I need to take a minute to say thank you for your amazing partnership with Merck and now also with Organon.  It's been so great working with you on these customers and I truly appreciate all of your  help and leadership along the way. Not only have you been leading Merck on their recent DEI initiative (which is obviously no small feat), but it's all the other things that you're always on top off, such as key anniversary dates and creating moments that matter, or talking to a partner of theirs that's interested in setting up a program of their own, or handling the contract negotiations for their spin-off of Organon. And speaking of Organon... you've jumped right in to help shape and mold Organon's new Global Head of Compensation as they  launch their new program with us. We've thrown a lot at her between a launch day award to all employees, Life Events and Conversations, to an appropriate budget of 1%....and she's loving all of it. This is only the beginning with them and I can't wait to see where Organon goes on their journey with us.  Thank you so much for your great partnership and leadership on these accounts and can't wait to see what's next.\n\n124#Creating a more diverse and inclusive world!!!!|A millions cheers to this team!! Changing the world!! It is not easy, right! It always seems impossible until you do EXTRAORDINARY and IMPACTFUL game changing things for the first time. Thank you for your passion, determination and imagination in creating more bigger, brighter, diverse and inclusive organizations and worlds!!  Today marks the day Merck launches our new Inclusion Awareness tools on their Inspire platform. Sheri, your leadership opened the door for us. You pushed and organized a meeting with Celeste Warren, VP Global D&I COE and Jeff Geller, SVP Global Rewards to share the vision, opportunity and possibilities to leverage Inspire in a significant and profound way to support and drive Merck's DEI strategy and goals! Yes, yes and yes ensued! The start of turning the \"possible\" to reality began. You lead from the front. Your leadership and guidance shaped how we managed Merck from yes to launch! Nuvs and Richard, our product experts who guided the Merck and WH teams through all of the who/what/why/where and how's to set this early access customer up for success - and helping us pivot and reshape along the way, setting expectations and building confidence. Meisha-ann and Yi, your partnership, providing additional context, educating us and supporting by identifying how to measure the impact of the new tools in numerous ways was critical! Joyce and Tirrill, coming up with the right messaging, integrating Merck's words into the messages, the internal comms and creating \"Reflections\" was superb! Plus, your nearly daily support was key! Lynette, the video script resonated from review one! It was impactful. Merck was delighted and called this out in an email. Luke, your sense of urgency for posting and re-posting the various versions of the video on Wistia was incredible! You all live our value of Respect for ALL! You gain the confidence and trust of others through your actions, honesty, integrity and authenticity! YOU ALL ROCK!!!\n\n125#Merck goes LIVE with the Inclusion Advisor!|So many congratulations and THANK YOUs go out to this mighty team for getting our friends at Merck to today, the launch of the Inclusion Advisor to their organization. There are a lot of little things that have to go right for these big things to go right. Your every day actions with Merck, the relationships you carry and nurture, all of the projects and all of the unsung behind the scenes work you do, it has ALL led us here. SO well done, great leadership all along the way!  From the Exec Director of Global D&I, \"Team – just some quick feedback from the GD&I Extended HR Leadership team on the INSPIRE video.  This was a global team and the video resonated really well – in particularly they commented on the breadth of diversity that was represented and are all very excited to sponsor this message across US HR colleagues.  My colleagues from the regions are really interested in this opportunity and are hopeful that the video can be translated to reach the broader audience when we are ready to do so.     Thank you everyone!   Christopher\n\n126#Sharing what great looks like|Sheri,  Thank you so much for taking the time to share the Merck and BMS story.  I wove little snippets in today's presentation to Syneos and it was well-received.  I could not have done it without your additional insights.  I also loved the slides you shared.  Thanks for taking the time to help, it was greatly appreciated.\n\n127#Success with BMS Annual Review!|Kudos to an amazing team!  Thank you to everyone for your efforts and insights which lead to an action packed 90 minute review of 2020.  We tried for months to secure time on the BMS team's calendar and it finally came to fruition!  Alan - your insights and deep dive into R&D and Sales really put the WOW factor into this presentation.  I appreciate your effort and hard work given a short time frame once we revised the deck and goals.  Meisha Ann - it's always a pleasure to have your input and presence on client calls.  You and your team are true professionals who make the client's eyes light up.  Danielle - You brought great ideas and strategies through the Comms section of the presentation.  I have no fear that the areas for improvement will SEE improvement with these comms and practices in place.  Traci - Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this amazing \"Connection\" focused deck with our group.  To say this was powerful is an understatement. I plan to use pieces of this presentation with my other accounts, too.   Sheri - you delivered this content like you had seen it 100x before... however I know it was your first time.  You had the group engaged and listening.  Great job!!  Erin - it's always such a pleasure when we have you present to bring your updates and plans for Product in the upcoming months.  Thank you for being a great partner!  And lastly Jay... always a consummate professional and so supportive as a leader.  You hold the longest tenure with BMS out of our group and bring wonderful history and context to the conversation.  Thank you everyone for helping to pull together a FANTASTIC meeting that will definitely help BMS go from great to AMAZING!\n\n128##ChoosetoChallenge for Positive Change|Leslie & Sheri, sometimes you read a quote, a statement, or a few lines of text and humans that represent those thoughts pop to the top of your mind. This quote from the 2021 Intl Women's Day theme \"from challenge comes change, so let's all choose to challenge\" immediately made me think of you two! During one our most challenging years ever, you both double-down on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion with some of our largest customers - Merck, GE, Eaton and Corning, to name a few. Bringing new innovative product/solution capabilities - Inclusion Awareness (reflections + award adviser) - to support and compliment these customers own Diversity & Inclusion purpose, mission and goals. You truly lived our value of Imagination + Determination = Innovation to get these customers to where they are today with us!   Imagination was lived as you embraced moving beyond traditional ways of doing things, creating new relationships with Chief D&I officers, DEI ERGs and continually demonstrating your ability to inspire others, pivot when needed and ultimately get to victory! Determination was lived as you stayed focused and composed in stressful situations. WH didn't always have all the answers, \"flying and building\" out these capabilities at the same time, learning and taking constructive action to navigate difficulties all for the betterment of what WH and customers could achieve together! Innovation and delivering on \"moonshots\" is now here. Merck will launch the new Inclusion Awareness capabilities on March 17th to an \"early access\" group. Eaton has said \"Let's Do.\", Corning is ready for the next meeting and GE is primed and future meetings getting set-up. Thank you for always challenging yourselves, your WH colleagues and our customers to be responsible and take action, call out gender biases, celebrate women's achievements, and collectively build the brightest, most inclusive world for all! YOU ROCK!!\n\n129#A Team Appreciation Day!|Happiest Employee Appreciation Day to this team of badasses! I could not be prouder to work with such a team of professionals. You make work fun! You show up every day, leaning in, supporting each other, raising the bar, and celebrating every moment along the way. I hope you feel the love every day but especially today! Thank you for being such great caretakers of our mission and leaders for the organization. Strategic Client Directors lead the way!\n\n130#Women in Tech Sales Bootcamp - Powerhouse Panel!|Sheri, Marie, Corbrina and Lauren - thank you SO much for participating in the panel for Women in Tech Sales Bootcamp! It was truly my honor to moderate your discussion and to showcase each of you during the session. I said it then and I'll say it now - you are a powerhouse group and we are lucky to have you all at Workhuman! You shared incredible insight into your career journeys and roles at Workhuman and gave excellent advice - everything from interviewing to how to stand out in your roles and be the most successful in sales. The participants were incredibly impressed and I received such positive feedback on the session. You were authentic, open and welcoming while sharing real-world advice - you represented yourselves and Workhuman perfectly. I am grateful for your prep time, for you sharing your stories and for always being willing to help the next group of women enter the world of sales. Thank you!\n\n131#Visibility 2021|It's February 18! We're almost halfway through the quarter! What a whirlwind 2021 has been. Thanks to this team of inspired minds for coming together this week to review detailed individual action plans for our strategic accounts and also coming together to share our biggest opportunities with each other. We all learn and grow so much together and I LOVE IT! Special shout out to our new BFF, Yuri! Thanks so much for kicking us off, inspiring our thinking, introducing us to the best new yogi 2021, and giving us some insight and vision for the future of WHCE. We're so lucky to have you! Thanks to everyone on the team for contributing to our Periscope project and Data Insights project. We've made some real progress on ass kicking and it's 'only' February! I see you!\n\n132#Workhuman Listens|All,  It’s been such a pleasure to talk to you all over the past weeks, and to hear how much the voice of our customers matters to you! Over the coming months, we will help you create surveys to tap into the wealth of great things our users have to say about our products, how positive their experiences are… how they feel using the platform!! We have distilled the conversations we have had into a roadmap, which we will share with all of you next week. Over the past year, we, the EXM team, have seen some heartwarming testimonials from users, and I have no doubt that we are about to open the floodgates of thanks! I recall about a year ago, when we did our first proper ‘Periscope’ that the resounding response was a 72% ‘Just plain THANK YOU’  and the remaining 28% had some really encouraging and helpful feedback to offer, which we can use to make our product even better!!  All we need to do is listen!  I am excited to start working with you, and encouraged by your enthusiasm for the program.  Let’s build Workhuman listens!    Brian, EXM team\n\n133#Moments that matter SUPER USER!|Sheri - As I was looking through our moments that matter tracking sheet, I noticed that almost every single email template that we created in Q4 was by YOU! You have been such an incredible partner and have taken full advantage of these email templates to help customers celebrate important milestones. You are consistently thinking about ways to recognize top customers and create special moments to make them feel acknowledged and celebrated. This is what Workhuman is all about and I wanted to thank you for being such a super user of these awesome tools. Keep it up!\n\n134#Connecting the dots at Tufts|Sheri, thank you for helping our selling efforts at Tufts Medical which will hopefullu open the door to Wellforce as a whole. Your inside track while not a guaranted win for us certainly gives us insider information we can use to better position our solutions and value prop to the right stakeholders. You took the time on a Friday to call and collaborate on strategy even while your phone and computer were blowin’ up. THANK YOU!\n\n135#The Assumptive Close|Congratulations, Sheri on the 3 year renewal of our business with Biogen! Without a doubt, Biogen has had an unexpectedly tough year--especially in the press. The one thing that helped them thrive was social recognition. Like the absolute pro that you are, without batting an eye, you turned around a 3 year renewal without any negotiation on pricing. You inspire me with your sales wizardry! Brava to a great kickoff to winning in 2021!\n\n136#Ready for a New Year!|Thanks to this very focused team of experts and leaders for creating something out of the tough 'hand' 2020 dealt us. Through all we've maneuvered through, I've consistently heard nothing but determination, strength, support for each other and for others, and a fierceness to overcome that is burned in my memory forever. As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking. Spending as much time as possible making things happen leaves little time for planning so all the more impressive how thoroughly you prepared to review action plans for each of your accounts. Thanks to our badass team of magicians, Traci and Rebecca for helping me pull off one of our greatest QBRs to date. Cheers to you all and to many more years of success together! You are all the magic of Christmas!\n\n137#A Brilliant Refresh!|Thank you all for your collective efforts in refreshing the look and feel of HARMAN's Be Brilliant recognition site.  These changes have been pending since March and were finally revealed to employees on Monday as a kick off to their designated Month of Gratitude.  The hard work that goes on behind the scenes for something like this certainly does not go unnoticed and definitely deserves to be recognized.  And thank you especially for pivoting to accommodate the change to the image that came from me asking the question if what they were planning to use was the best representation of what they were trying to convey.  The site looks absolutely fantastic and will be a great backdrop for HARMAN as they get ready to turn monetary recognition back on in a few weeks.  So thank you all for an absolutely amazing and Brilliant Refresh!!!\n\n138#Grateful for the 'A' Team|Sending a heartfelt moment of thanks to this team of fierce friends. 2020 has been a test in many ways. The one thing that it has cemented for me is that the bonds that we make over time are clearly revealed in times of struggle. Thank you for your unwavering support of each other and the business through these many, many months of stress and hard work. Wishing each of you a day of rest and some time to reflect on your achievements thus far. I continue to be inspired by you and by the possibilities you see in yourselves and each other!\n\n139#Truly Excellent GE Meeting|Truly excellent call today with our partners at GE. You both brought your typical 'A game' and helped our buddy Phil and his new boss, Craig, really understand the value proposition of merchandise as well as the incredibly detailed data driven decisions we are making on behalf of their employees every day. I was so impressed as this conversation naturally unfolded to see Craig smiling, nodding, and gaffawing especially once Phil confessed that we had put his idea of S&H fees 'being too high' to bed. I also believe that by being prepared with the Brazil data on merchandise redemptions that we've opened the door to getting merchandise turned on GLOBALLY in the next year. WELL DONE! TGIF!\n\n140#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n141#5 Year Anniversary Video for ADP!|I wanted to thank you all for participating the video montage we created for ADP's 5 Year anniversary with Workhuman. The video came out AMAZING and we could not have pulled it off without all of you! We received such great feedback from the folks at ADP and it just goes to show the impact that human moments that matter have on our customers. Way to go team!!\n\n142#Making Big Impact at GE|Sheri, it is not lost on me how much it takes to manage our GE relationship. It's basically 4 customers. So, when I see feed back from the Hd of People Operations, a very big voter, I'm blown away at how you are mindful of all the little details that make big impact. An incredible thoughtful video message with a celebratory tone that he'll be experiencing the new modern anniversary program that we've launched for them. Well played, my friend! His response \"Now that is a nice touch, Sheri. I really appreciate you going out of your way to do this. It means a lot and you exemplify what it means to provide a world-class employee experience in a moment that matters! Thank you and have a great weekend.\"  You remain remarkable!\n\n143#Inclusive of Merck|Sheri, we just got off an amazing call with Celeste Warren the CDO at Merck.  It was a fantastic meeting and we are already talking workshops and launch dates for them to use our Inclusion Advisor.  And you set it all up. Meetings like this don't just happen all in one 30 minute session.  It has been over a year that you were doing brand awareness with Celeste. And pre-positioning a \"next stage\" step with other Merck leaders.  You made sure we teased the value proposition for the Inclusion Advisor and recruited Aaron and Jeff to bring in Celeste. You coordinated all the pieces and our own executives to support today's meeting. Well done.  Textbook top account management.  It was a great meeting with clear next steps and you were the reason.  Excellent!\n\n144#HARMANizing Our Approach|What a great team effort this morning as we met with HARMAN to strategize on the approach to help them refresh the Be Brilliant program.  Sheri - thank you so much for pitching the idea to hold a Gratitude Summit which completely resonated with the HARMAN team and fits in nicely with their vision of declaring December a month of gratitude.  Your ideas, energy and flexibility during the call where fantastic.  And Maggie - thank you for sharing your perspectives having been part of the initial refresh conversations with the team and sharing all of the amazing templates that are being built out for the upcoming season of giving and the 2021 fresh start as well.  Both sets of slides were very well received by HARMAN and provided them with some tangible visuals to give shape to the conceptual ideas that they had started to formulate.  So thank you both for your teamwork and partnership.  We'll got a bit of work to do over the next few months & I look forward to diving into it with both of you!\n\n145#Doing the dirty work|Let's face it, data clean up is no fun.  But, it's worth it!  Thank you for taking time out of your insane schedules to comb through data, find missing pieces and populate our tracker.  Becasue of your efforts we'll be able to get this into a centralized place - allowing us to work smarter and faster from here on out.  Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and getting it done!\n\n146#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n147#Inspiring INSPIRE|Sheri, Mark, Joyce and Erica,  We have just finished our briefing with Merck and what a wonderful job this team has done in partnership with one of the world's great companies. It's hard to believe how much the team members and executives gush about their relationship with all of you.  Not only did they nominate Workhuman for an Inspiring Workplace Award (which we won) but they called us out as the ideal kind of partner for Merck.  Here are a couple of direct quotes I noted today: \"Of the 70 vendors we deal with, Workhuman is easily in the top 3\"; and \"deciding to work with Workhuman and create a recognition culture at our spinout Organon was by far the easiest decision we had to make of the 10,000 decisions we're going though\".  Those are not just polite compliments.  Some companies don't get even one comment like that in their entire existence.  You inspired two in 30 minutes! It is a testament to the amazing work you are doing every day.  On behalf of all of us on the Workhuman team, thank you for representing us so well.  Great ambassadors. Well done team!\n\n148#Re-Imagining What's Possible with Relationships!|Wow, Sheri you are a girl on fire! I feel like you have a poster in your office that says \"Showing up in thoughtful, meaningful ways builds trust, trust builds relationships, relationships build business, and succeeding in business happens when you build connections and make others feel seen, heard and appreciated!\" Yep, it's probably right next to the photo of your girls and dogs!   I've witnessed first-hand the phenomenal job you are doing with your laser-like focus on building strong relationships with Laura Cococcia, Head of Strategy and Program Management at GE corporate and her direct reports Megan Newhouse and Michelle Hafford. It's super impressive! You continuously create moments that matter for GE's senior leaders that are positively saturated with connection, value, insights and guidance.   Laura recently shared with you she was hosting two critical internal meetings 1. for GE's Leadership team and 2. for the HR Community of 250+ strong. You proactively identified ways for WH to help support these initiatives and organized a meeting to discuss. In advance of the call you spotted it was Laura's anniversary and arranged for the WH team to have a customized Happy Anniversary background. Laura was blown away at the start of the call, saying \"No one remembered it was my anniversary except you.\" And it was obvious from the dialogue and her body language, you are someone she trusts, respects and looks to for strategic guidance! A major breakthrough at GE as we've been clawing for senior leader champions for years!  Talk about experience, you developed a meeting agenda to cover what was most important at this time as well as what's possible in the future. Two opportunities (1) Supporting critical internal meetings and (2) Sharing GE's story with the world. At the end Laura said \"The presentation, content and examples were so customized, as if we sit next to them every day.\" What a testament to knowing our customers!! YOU ROCK!!\n\n149#High Praise from GE!|Well done team for delivering a phenomenal customer experience for GE.  When speaking to Kostas recently, who was thrilled to be asked to talk to IBM by the way, he shared high praise for the work of this team!  He shared that he felt that you have demonstrated amazing partnership!  You have come to the table with ideas, data analysis, proactive recommendations to move the needle on their program, incredible flexibility, and unyielding support.  He asked me to please give a \"Big thank you to the team\" from him!  Thank you for delivering the Workhuman Experience!  I LOVE getting such high praise, especially when unsolicited and from such a great partner customer!  Well done!\n\n150#Making it all about THEM|Thank you for meeting earlier this week to wrestle with the eternal question: \"What matters most to senior leaders at our top accounts?\".  The thoughtful, candid and creative ideas you brought to the table are going to help immensly as we develop the Insider Insights session for our key accounts.  And when we put customers at the center and consider their perspective, we guarantee success!\n\n151#The Two Day ZoomBR Bonfire!|Thanks to this amazing team for two days (well, half days) of inspired thinking and planning in preparation for an amazing 2nd Half! As much as we missed the personal interaction and late nights, we managed to reconnect in a way that we really haven't been able to pull off in a few months! Special shout out to our Queen, Traci Pesch! She really knows how to inspire, engage, and fan the flames of success! Between Traci and Rebecca's creative minds we've got a great plan to find s'more ways to connect and create incredible experiences for our customers! And, looky here, we've got ourselves a marketing team! Thanks ever so much to the gods who sent us our fierce team in customer marketing, represented with the incredible Kristen G! A thoughtful, workable plan to bring our friends into the many cool streams happening in marketing. And lastly, thanks to all of you badass SCDs, always bringing the big ideas, shaking things up, pushing beyond your comfort zones and helping our customers do the same! I'm humbled and impressed every day to get to work with such a powerful group of people who do nothing but cheer each other on! Let's go light this thing up!\n\n152#Making an IMPACT Every Day!!!|Sheri!! Your tremendous imagination + determination has lead to extraordinary amounts of IMPACT with GE. It's not easy working with large, complex, multi-national companies in-constant-change but you grind every day and make great things happen!! I think you've morphed into GE's company mission of 'building a world that works' with an ending of 'for humans.' That's right every day I see your commitment to building a work that works for the 275,000+ humans at GE! A few impactful milestones in the last several months span most people's entire careers! Design Labs for every IFG to reset on philosophy, what good looks like, how to get there, and actionable next steps. These efforts resulted in an immediate relaunch of GE Healthcare's program aligned with their new Leadership Behaviors and enabling new program features, GE's attendance at the Unilever event in London, a Gratitude Summit for GE Renewables Total Rewards team, then a training for Renewables 10,000 People Leaders, meetings with Laura Cococcia (Head of People Strategy) from GE Corporate, migration of GE's traditional 16 year old year service program with us to Service Timelines! Say what?? Yep, finally after doing the hard work, consistently reminding GE leaders of the value of Service Timelines, sticking to the every day grind, GE migrated to Service Timelines!! A huge milestone. Do you know a pandemic is happening in the world? You're unstoppable!!! GE can't guzzle enough of your high energy drink called \"lower value awards given more frequently\" ... or let's call it a Sweet Social Sensation by Sheri!! GE's HR executives are ordering doubles and wiping out the mindset of recognition for 'above and beyond' efforts only and rallying the troops around every day gratitude mantra! I'm in awe of how your imagination and determination is your \"True North\". You work with purpose, you dream big, you set high standards and you make an IMPACT!!! You Rock!!!\n\n153#The firsts!|Ryan and Sheri, hats off to you both for being the first to try out our new award templates with your customers. Being the \"first\" always carries some risk but you both got a hold of these new asset and immediately saw the opportunity and took action. I LOVE THIS! Awesome job! I can't wait to hear what their feedback is!\n\n154#The July 4th event: Email Edition!|Thank you to this incredible cross-functional team for all of the work that went into producing our first ever cross-company email promotion!  Leveraging all of our learnings from our marketo redemption reminders from the first half of this year, I'm thrilled we were able to pull together this first ever \"promotional holiday\" campaign and learn about the opportunity to market a retail event happening on the store across a number of our customers.  From build the content, to building out the assortment on site, to securing promotional pricing, to coordinating with customers and gaining their buy in to preparing the data and lists for this massive send, it would not have been possible without your dedication to this next phase of email testing.  I'm super excited to track results, and look forward to next steps.  Thank you!!\n\n155#Warrior Ethos|Sheri! So many congrats on yet another hard fought victory at Synchrony. It's not just that this was a hard fought competitive win vs our very aggressive competitors, it's that it is your 3rd since December! The scenario is always tough, new decision makers, no experience with us, no idea what their strategy has been or really any history with the program at all. Now throw in a pandemic, stay at home stresses, GE and the various projects you are juggling, and several other strategic accounts. Very few people could handle the pure insanity let alone be successful at every turn. I've been so impressed with your ability to connect, inspire, and close so many senior leaders and procurement people. Congratulations on this battle, you are one bad mothah!\n\n156#Wow|Team, I was reviewing all of your progress updates for top accounts early this morning and I have to say that the work this team is doing is fantastic.  So many different variables are involved in these huge, complex accounts but each of you is on top of your accounts in such a strategic way.  Whether it is new growth in thriving accounts like bulk uploads, new sales incentive programs and retirement/milestone awards or just the right amount of surrounding for those accounts in temporary suspension.  This \"in the trenches\" work is so critical to the health and growth of both our business and the lives of the employees at your customers.  They need it more than ever right now.  Bravo and well done!  And special call out to your fearless leader Eileen who is leading from the front with a huge dose of imagination and determination.  Happy Monday!\n\n157#Making a BIG Impression|Sheri, Traci, Erica & Maggie - thank you for your partnership over these past few weeks on our Biogen Site Refresh Strategy presentation. While upgrading their BIG recognition site was the original impetus of the meeting, this was also a crucial opportunity to get in front of Justin Fossbender, the Executive Sponsor and owner of their BIG program and share our latest and greatest insights on the positive impact of social recognition. We hadn't been able to speak with Justin and other key stakeholders for quite some time, and the hard work you put in enabled us to deliver the key data and ideas that will grow Biogen's already high-performing program. Sheri, you expertly laid the foundation for the day's discussion by allowing Justin & team to communicate their 2020 people strategy, and then layered that into your outline of our current insights and solutions. Traci & Maggie, as always you impressed with your convincing content and enthusiastic approach towards explaining the philosophy of working human and how it's changed (and continues to improve) the way we work. Erica, your Biogen-specific insights around turnover and how organic recognition has seen some positive post-pandemic growth was crucial to the meeting, and clearly caught Justin's attention. It's data like this that will help us keep a strong foothold with him and drive our initiatives forward - running deeper analyses, refreshing/relaunching their site and then hopefully adding items such as Life Events and Service Timelines. Team, everything's on the table thanks to each of your contributions. Thanks again.\n\n158#Dream Team|I just want to take this moment to pay homage to this team of fierce, talented leaders for their focus and resilience during what is sure to go down in history as one of the most stressful times in world history. It's been quite an experience for each of us during this pandemic both from the work perspective and the 'outside of work' perspective. Each of you has been laser focused on the opportunity this situation created for our business and each of you have created opportunities out of this situation for the business! I'm so humbled by the never-quit mentality that you have lead with and continue to lead with in this environment. The impact you have made on our business at this moment is astounding. Thank you for the sacrifices, determination, support for each other, humor, and grace you have shown these past few months. It's pure joy to work with you!\n\n159#Master Level Skillz|Sheri, I just want to call out the master level pricing conversation you lead with our customer last week. I was in awe watching you work your strategy and 'the room'. Your experienced positioning, messaging, determination, and poise were at a 10! I witnessed the full transformation of the customer from defensive to educated and gracious. We have a ways to go but I am confident that you are the kind of leadership that inspires the best thinking and decision making at our customers. Bravo!\n\n160#How to Build Connection 101|When a customer doesn't 'do' video, how do you show them who you are? Talk about a game changing powerful idea! Shouting it out to this GE dream team for inspiring us all to make the connection and unabashedly share who we are no matter the technology! What an incredible Moment that Matters!  I JUST LOVE IT!\n\n161#Gratitude for the Merck Story|Sheri, Jay, and Mark, thank you all for your help bringing the Merck webinar to life. Sheri and Jay, we really appreciate the guidance you provided around the Merck story and some of the specifics around our partnership with their team. Thank you reviewing content and providing feedback. Mark, thank you for arming us with the latest and greatest metrics, and also for reviewing content to ensure no stone was left unturned. Customers stories like these only exist because of the work you do day in and day out to deliver a truly \"workhuman experience\" for our customers. I’m so grateful for the strong relationships you’ve built that create these opportunities for the larger team. Thank you!\n\n162#Insightful Collaboration|Shout out to this team of creative geniuses! Getting in front of our strategic accounts with the impact that recognition is having on their employees (and more broadly, employees all over the world!) is of the utmost importance right now. Making it memorable and actionable is next level! Thank you for coming together and creating such an inspirational package for the whole team to leverage with the 'right' people! Bravo!\n\n163#CREATING A WAVE of GRATITUDE|Can you feel it? It's a soul lifting, soaking you to the bone, crashing wave of gratitude and joy that is emanating from this group of people. There are SO many ways this team of people is banding together, ideating, taking action, sharing, and LIFTING our customers (and each other) in this incredible hectic time! I just want to take a moment to say thank you for working through this time of uncertainty with your hearts on your sleeve. For reaching out to customers and giving them strength and light and the power to do good. If there was ever a team meant for the right now, it's this team. Thank you from leading from each of your seats and for creating incredible opportunities on a daily basis for our customers, for our brand, and for our business! You're ALL HEART and I'm loving it!!!\n\n164#Bring in the contract closer|Sheri, I wanted to recognize the amazing job you've done in getting the Bristol-Myers multi-year contract signed.  This has been quite a testament to the quality of work you provide our business and customers on a daily basis.  Not only that but you were brand new to this account and it seemed like contract questions were coming within days of being introduced to the BMS team.  This has been an interesting process in getting through a number of specific questions with the procurement team and helping to show our value to a new program team.  You were a maestro in orchestrating a number of different internal meetings and helping to tell the right story throughout all the contract discussions.  Thank you for all the great work, diligence, effort and grit you showed throughout the entire process.  We now have an even longer relationship in tact with BMS as a result of all your incredible work!\n\n165#Full Speed Ahead|#weworkhuman #shootthemoon #theinstitute  What a revitalizing day and a half! Thank you to this team of great big thinkers and risk takers for a deeply challenging few days of daring to reach for BIG ideas and creative paths to accomplish our mission. It was a great way to kick off our “project” for 2020. I believe this team, in this partnership, can achieve new heights. Thank you for giving yourself to this with your whole self! Cheers to the Dream State! Special shouts to Becky, Traci, and Jill for helping nail down our process and making sure we paused to drink and eat!!!\n\n166#Knocking out two birds with one stone|Sheri, what an amazing job you did with two recent meetings with the Bristol-Myers team...all in the same day!  First, I have to recognize all the effort you've poured into the contract discussions with their procurement contacts over the past several weeks.  You continue to build an incredible story around the Bravo program and the impact it is having across BMS as well as why we continue to be the partner to align with over the next several years.  You have worked with a number of internal teams in orchestrating the story we are trying to tell with truly compelling data.  Not only that but you continue to show a resolve and focus with all the conversations around a new contract.  The meeting with the procurement contacts was managed so well, where you provided a deep level of insights which really helped set the stage as we were moving forward with the proposal conversation.  Then we jumped right into an account review with the new program team that really helped build momentum as BMS is working on bringing Bravo to more employees.  You were able to share a number of stories that resonated with the new program team with some really exciting follow up items.  Thank you for jumping right into this account and some of these deeper conversations.  It's been like you've been working with this client for years.  I always enjoy working together on any account and this was just another example of the strategic direction you're able to share and lead with our clients.  Nice work!\n\n167#Sheri Riter is having a WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!|Sheri,  nothing makes me happier than a great story, except 17 great stories! To say that you have had some 'stuff' going on is an incredible understatement. We have this spectrum of engagement on our team and it ranges from something like \"moving someone to the cause\" to \"get the right data/insights in front of the right person\" to \"break all former understood standards and MAKE SOME SH*T HAPPEN\". And, there is literally 100% of our time and energy committed to every stage...which is at times death defying and humanly physically impossible. That is why, seeing all of the work come to such beautiful crescendos is such a gift! Getting all the things right along the way to position our CEO to have an incredibly productive meeting with the Hd of HR Strategy at GE---GOLD! Pushing hard on Hershey's 'new' procurement team to hold the value of our contract---GOLD! Positioning our work at BMS to their hired guns 'take no prisoners' procurement consultants in such a way that they immediately agree that THIS work must continue and that they've missed the biggest part of the picture---SOLID GOLD! Delivering sweet celebrations to our partners at Merck on their 1 millionth recognition moment---and for Jeff Geller to send you a very meaningful thank you note, speaking about our partnership, I mean.....CHOCOLATE wrapped in GOLD! And those are just the things you've managed to highlight! Congrats on all of your masterful work producing such sweet sweet rewards! Cheers to you, Sheri!!!\n\n168#Setting the stage|Sheri,   Excellent work with the exec preparation for the upcoming GE executive meeting.  I encourage  all reps and SCDs to reach out to you to understand how you went about helping Eric prepare for his upcoming meeting.  Not only did you gather all key information about the account, the current situation, issues and opportunities, people and goals for the meeting, but you made it all accessible in one easy to find place, added an excellent executive summary to bring it all together and delivered a personal briefing to walk through it with support from other leaders.  A how-to manual for helping us get the most of this unique opportunity.  Well done!\n\n169#Video stars!|Jay, Sheri, Brian, and Nicole - MJ and I would like to thank each of you for participating in the creation of the customer story videos for Ignite Boston (soon to be shared in Dublin). There was a quick turnaround on these videos and you each made yourselves available to the video team and shared your personal experiences with our customers so all could better understand the ways in which our people and the work each of us does is making a difference in the world. The videos were impactful and we so appreciate the critical part you played in making them a reality! Thank you.\n\n170#Teamwork at Ignite Solutions!|Sheri - thank you so much for presenting our groups findings with me today during the break out session! With a full room of people I was a little nervous, but you helped everything run smoothly! So great to partner with you along with everyone else.\n\n171#Hackathon for the Ages!|Amazing team, I cannot thank each and every one of you enough for your brilliance during the second Workhuman Live Hackathon this week! First and foremost, with Ignite around the corner;  there is no shortage things to get accomplished, GREATLY appreciate the time taken out of your busy days to help us crowdsource ideas and think differently to capture the excitement AND carry it forward, even when WH Live 2020 comes to an end. Nice work being respectful brainstormers and challenging one another. I am so excited to put these ideas in action against our personas and a timeline. We have never been in better shape to make the most of Workhuman Live and it's because of this group, Cheers to you all!\n\n172#Hershey hero|Sheri - I wanted to call out all the hard work you have put into Hershey over the last few months. Since I’ve joined the account you have been hard at work trying to find ways to wow at the executive level, despite some  challenges Hershey has gifted you with. You have utilized relationships outside of the core program team to get us in front of their procurement team and give us a chance to show them what amazing partners we are. You have put a lot of time and energy into getting their “pesky” procurement team what they need as soon as they need. Internally you got all the right players involved to help present to Hershey in an hour long meeting. Some may think an hour long meeting is a piece of cake, but not when someone else is setting the agenda for you. As soon as we walked out of our most recent meeting with Hershey you were already mapping out next steps. Your dedication to your customers is amazing! Thank you for all your help, support and leadership on Hershey!\n\n173#Accelerating into 2020|What a year of surprises! Thanks to each of you for bringing your insights, ideas, and energy to bear on our top 5 accounts. We've been meeting quarterly to review from every angle how we can from every perspective, impact the business. So many great ideas were uncovered and put into action immediately from these conversations. And each of us, learned something big about how with some focus, we could more directly impact big opportunities as an organization. Thank you for early and late meetings, for staying focused, and for caring so much about excellence! This has been an incredible 'test' of the WH network! Bravo!\n\n174#Increasing the possibilities with Biogen|Team, we had a very successful on-site strategy and program review meeting at Biogen last week - and it absolutely would not have been possible without your contributions.  Erica,  you pulled together such comprehensive and compelling analyses for the client. You illustrated the tangible impact their program has had on employee retention and provided insights on where the specific opportunities are to increase employee engagement with the program. You were also a pleasure to work with as we refined the presentation.  Jesse, you impressed as always with your overview of what your team has accomplished, and the possibilities of the insights we can provide Biogen with going forward. They were clearly impressed and subsequently open to working more closely with us on leveraging data to increase their program's reach and effectiveness.  Sheri, on what was an extremely busy week for you, you still came through with a very effective Workhuman update and overview of the impact of recognition. It set the table perfectly for Jesse, Erica and I to talk about Biogen's specific program performance.  Thanks again to all of you for your hard work on this. We're in a great position now to grow their program further with the addition of Service Timelines, and getting more of their employees actively recognizing their colleagues.\n\n175#Q4 QBRs Rocked!|Thanks to every person on this team for bringing your best selves to Cleveland in the middle of a flurry of major projects, meetings, deliverables, and personal commitments. Each of you came together to share some incredible best practices, strategies that have moved the needles with our biggest opportunities, and some big plans for 2020. There is no better group of people to spend 2.5 days with talking about work. You bring a passion to the business that is only matched by Traci's passion for Cleveland! Thank you for your commitment to excellence! You ROCK!\n\n176#Interview WIN|THANK YOU to this team of humans for a successful day of interview chaos this week. Although our day did not end in an offer, our candidates both had a great experience here, and I’m confident they will be singing our praises regardless of the outcome. You were all on top of your game making sure you knew where you needed to be and when. We had great representation for presentations, and I know that our candidates truly felt welcomed and enjoyed their time here with us. That is a win in my book! Thank you for bearing with me as we dealt with schedule shifts, room shifts, network issues, and for graciously allowing me to chase you around the office all day =)  I appreciate you!\n\n177#A great plan for success with HARMAN 2020|Thankyou Sheri, Erica and Erin, we certainly made an impression over the two hours we planned for! Despite a dip in this year results with the Be Brilliant Program! we could not ask for a better turnaround of events in this meeting. When Erica presented some insightful results into what WHARI is telling us which sparked the topic about building back trust and empowering employees to own the culture by nominating more frequently but encouraging the smaller awards, you could hear the AHA moment in the room where the HARMAN team simply stated we have to use this budget even more so based on some of those findings that WHARI highlighted!!! It was great to hear Lori (HARMAN’s VP Reward) make those comments and openly ask for our guidance and how we best execute a 2020 plan of action that includes a turbo boost in comms, manager training, educating division leaders on the fact that Be Brilliant is an investment and not a spend, holding leaders accountable to nominate more frequently!! And there was more, with great interest with the PENDO project, thanks Erin for bringing them through this impressive initiative which they really liked and can see the benefits of it to help improve further adoption. Finally, thanks to you Sheri for making the trip down to Stamford to be the face for Workhuman and for making sure we addressed all the topics we prepped for!!   It’s always a great sign the meeting was a success when you get an email from the client saying \"just left the meeting feeling energized and ready to bring BE BRILLIANT to the next level’! Roll on 2020!! \"Well done everyone!!\n\n178##MakingImpact #DeliveringResults|Sheri! Sheri! Wow, I feel like I just finished a Master's Class in advanced Business Strategy and Execution thanks to you! Talk about formulating a strategy, changing perspectives on what's possible, and aggressively mapping steps to clearly accelerate program growth and sustainability in the most challenging times ... you nailed it! GE has been in the news for years with headlines like 'Will GE Survive?, Will GE Ever Bounce Back?\". In true Sheri fashion you saw this as an incredible opportunity to help GE rethink the power of recognition to transform culture, boost morale, increase engagement and keep employee's feeling their work had a purpose and is valued.   You put your strategy into motion! First, creating connections with senior leaders/decision makers. You secured a half-day slot for WH at Kosta's HC HRLT meeting to share the Future of Work, what's possible through recognition, and how to invest properly to achieve desired talent and business outcomes. They quickly understood the value of increasing peer to peer recognition moments, lower value awards given more frequently and embedding this mindset change into communication strategies and tactics for managers and individual contributors. Kostas even stated \"We need more recognition happening daily. There is enough budget to spend $10-15M on this program this year\".    Second, you urgently brought WH thought leadership to all GE's Businesses - HC, Power, Aviation and Renewables - knowing investment next year will be decided at this level. You relentlessly pursued setting up Design Labs with decision makers, strategized on 'Quick Wins' and Long-Term Goals. This resulted in 30+ new connections, renewed excitement about social recognition, mindset of more peer recognition and lower value awards given more frequently and how to fund. 1st 10 months of 2019 vs. 2018, GE's spend increased by $6M, or 27%. Can't wait to see what 2020 brings with the new foundation in place! You Rock! #MakingImpact.\n\n179#Interview Punctuality|Sheri - thank you so much for being so punctual to your Customer Success interview!  When I walked my candidate into the interview room a few minutes early, you were already there!  Knowing that you had to leave the interview a few minutes early to make a client call on time, you showed up a few minutes early to make up for the lost time.  Thank you so much for going the extra mile to get your full 30 minutes with the candidate, and for creating a great candidate experience!\n\n180#Making Magic at Merck|Jay, Sheri and Erin,  It's not often that I'm privileged enough to walk into a two-year account review and see the conversation flow so smoothly with so much cause for celebration. The level of trust and respect in the room is a testament to the close partnership that's been cultivated over the 2+ (really 3+) years by you three. Some of the magical moments that come to mind: Jeff, their SVP of Global Compensation & Benefits, congratulating us on a successful launch of their \"peers\" J&J, and telling us that it's a close-knit community in human health sciences, so word spreads fast when things go well.  Aaron, another executive program sponsor, telling us, \"This partnership has made this company better. We've been able to touch clients' lives in a positive way.\" Michaela, our program manager, describing our common sense of purpose and symmetry in our businesses, we both focus on humans. Erin, your involvement at both ends of the Merck journey, as LSM and now the critical linkage to Product has been invaluable. As Jeff states that he's asked Outlook integration every year, and he's going to ask for it for the third time, it was perfect timing to turn to you and have you be able to provide a glimpse of things to come. Even with slight changes to the Merck team, we've been able to maintain the open conversation and evolution of the program. I'm excited to see what the next four years (and beyond!) bring.\n\n181#Delivering a moment that matters to Merck CHRO|A big thanks to each of you for making this project come to life! Beautiful things happen when we all work together. We have yet to meet the CHRO at Merck and with his 1 year anniversary approaching, Sheri jumped on the opportunity to make that a moment that matters! We have created something inspiring, educational and celebratory to deliver! Carrie, your creative skills are what makes this data come to life - I would hang this in my office! Dianne, you jumped into action immediately and stayed on top of every detail to get a quick turn around. Project Management skills of a true #bosslady! Amanda, always coming in clutch when last minute details are needed to execute! Jay, Joyce and Erin - once you are tied to an account, you are always tied to the account. Ha! Thank you for quickly getting a hold of stats and details of their journey. Sheri - no matter what is on your plate, you never miss a beat. This is because of you. Great job everyone!\n\n182#Another productive Merck meeting|Team, I know this is overdue but wanted to thank you all for your preparation, presentation and great work at the recent Merck onsite meeting where we covered a number of important topics with their program team.  As a result of your efforts we had a very productive meeting in a short amount of time.  We were able to make progress with their procurement team on their contract renewal, present our new Onboarding award experience, review bringing on their US contractors to the recognition program, demo Executive Feedback, share what our experiential redemption awards will look like, review communication strategies and still found time for some program updates.  This was no small feat given the amount of time we had to cover each item.  The Merck team was completely engaged through the day and we were able to leave the meeting with some good progress on all fronts.  Thank you all for your teamwork in helping to support each other in the course of the client conversations as we continue to find unique ways to grow the Inspire program across the organization.  We are a trusted and valued partner with their leadership team and that continued to show itself as a result of this latest meeting.\n\n183#'Healthy' Start to Day! Design Lab w/GE Healthcare|I am go grateful to be a apart of this amazing team taking 15 years with GE to the next level of greatness and true imagination at work, Workhuman style! Sheri, our strategic leader and thinker. GE is experiencing lots of business challenges. You continue to position the WH Cloud as a critical component for culture transformation, modern day leadership, exceptional employee experience and connectedness which translates directly into talent and business outcomes! Getting GE Healthcare to think 'Quick, Impactful WINS, in the short-term and Bolder, Bigger WINS post-Workday launch.' You educate on what's possible. Last week Kostas said 'I love the microsite you created. Lots of valuable information in there.' Talk about getting a new heartbeat at Healthcare! Kara, you continue to shine with your deep knowledge and expertise around the platform, out of the box thinking on what's possible in the short-term and always strategizing on the long-term goals. Your demo today, the added color, story you were telling was so impactful. Greg, after a 4:30am start to drive 3 hours, your presence alone up-levels any meeting (the Dr  is in the house) ,you presented Healthcare's data, what story it told, highlighting the opportunities, showcasing what great looks like, weaving in other customer stories had them coming to all the right conclusions - mindset change is needed. More peer to peer recognition, managers and peers, giving and receiving at about 1 per month resonated well! All of our voices will be in there heads tonight hearing \"lower value awards given more frequently.\" The most beautiful cheer of all! Rich, you jumped in at the last minute to listen and learn as the recently assigned launch manager. We truly appreciated the behind the scenes support! Lots of WINS today. Award reasons that matter, mindset change program is for everyday efforts, both big and small, increase in investment, proper comms rollout strategy and continued excitement!! New Life, New Heart!\n\n184#Creating Magic at GE|Sheri, I want to acknowledge your incredible leadership through our next-gen work at GE. There have been many a roadblock, political nonsense, old vs new players, and a lot of tough business 'announcements' as it relates to GE. Through it all, every week, you seem to look past what feels like an uphill climb, and serve up the next BIG idea that moves us to a new level---to new heights! It was such an awesome feeling to have a senior executive this week come charging toward us, delighted by all of the upcoming possibilities with the social recognition strategy! Thank you for your tireless work (and very long days), thinking SO big, challenging our internal partners to create, surprise, and delight with every step! Here's looking at a most successful re-launch and many more years of great partnership! Cheers!\n\n185#Inspired Offsite|Thanks to this group of dreamy strategic thinkers for coming together to talk about the future! It’s a big ask to set a whole day aside and spend every minute challenging yourself to see bigger and write the future. With the fantastic support and creative talents of Amanda and Melissa, we were really able to have some inspired conversations and start to imagine how we can move our business closer and closer to the Dream State. Special shout out to our personal energizer, Traci P for keeping it fun and physical! Rebecca, you are an incredible partner to our team—-thank you for your incredible work to get us organized and planning forward! Cheers!\n\n186#Passing the Baton!|Sheri - I want to call out the amazing support and guidance you have given me and continue to bring with Teva. I know this is a client close to you heart and I promise to to do my best to continue the great work you have clearly done there. Thank you for helping me onboard with them, your knowledge and intuition is such a joy.\n\n187#Q3 Acceleration|Thanks to this team for another outstanding Acceleration Project quarterly mind meld. Every quarter we come together representing the expertise and perspective of many areas of the business. This quarter was special as we've 'accelerated' our thinking and really got the team thinking bigger and making connections and recommendations. This commitment and intense work for our top 5 customers is paying off as we have come away with a laundry list of opportunities and ideas to grow and protect the business. Thank you for your teamwork, intense listening skills, and outstanding impactful insights!!!\n\n188#The Percussion Section is on FIRE|Thanks to each of you for bringing your 'best beats' to Bootcamp! Every great band needs a percussion section that can offer confidence, a solid framework, and some sick solos. Each of you came to play in Newport! Thank you for sharing your success with our most significant customers, your confidence in our market leadership, and your learnings along the way. Not only did you share with the broader sales organization but also in our team meetings throughout the week.  It's always tough to get through our QBR session, even when we have twice the time, so this time was especially impactful as you shared your work and opportunities. Especially thankful for our teammates who are bringing the pain with some incredible marketing ideas and experience projects that should elevate our ability to play into our Mick Jagger years! Cheers!\n\n189#Inspiring Hearts & a New Mindset @ GE Healthcare|Sheri! Sheri! Sheri!! What an amazing and transformative 2.5 hours with the CHRO and Senior HR leaders of GE Healthcare last week! You truly orchestrated one of the most educational, inspiring and impactful sessions that's probably ever happened at GE's Global Learning Center in Crotonville, NY. A learning session for the record books, for sure! It all started with your leadership, commitment and dedication to ensuring the 2.5 hours with this group would be maximized with the right blend of rich content, personal 'surprise and delight' moments, and human connection! Get these nay-sayers, low participating givers to really understand the impact of gratitude, how recognition transforms culture, why it's important to empower the masses, more peer to peer recognition, coming from a larger pool of givers, utilizing all available tools to broadcast and amplify what good looks like and the right level of investment to make the IMPACT that GE Healthcare is looking to on the organization. An organization that's undergoing massive change! You not only wanted to show the science behind gratitude but bring in the emotional and human elements, too. You sourced a video from a colleague, Petra that was shared on the day! A HUGE moment during the meeting! Bringing together the heart and mind to show the whole picture. What's good for business is good for HUMANS!  The IMPACT you've had on the GE account has been tremendous! This quote is YOU ... Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It's about IMPACT, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading passion you have for your work and inspiration is helping team-mates and customers think bigger, do bigger and achieve more!! Well, you NAILED IT, Sheri! GE Healthcare is about to get a new heart beat thanks to YOU!! Congrats on putting together a winning strategy for the GE account overall, the GE Healthcare Senior HR leaders meeting and the new horizon  that's coming for all!!!\n\n190#Merck dream team|Jay, Joyce, and Sheri - WOW! Another amazing account review at Merck. Yesterday we had the chance to sit down with both the core program team and our executive sponsors and review the last 18 months of Inspire. In the meeting our executive sponsors said that Inspire has created a phenomenal transformation within the company. They also said the data itself shows they hit an unmet need and proves that Merck has truly created a culture of recognition. Aaron couldn't stop talking about the amazing anecdotal feedback he has received all across the globe. These praises are a true testament to the hard work you each put into this program every day. Jay- you are the glue that keeps everything together. You go above and beyond to keep Merck happy, and have truly earned their trust at all level. It's not every day an executive sponsor says he's not worried about the spend... Joyce- your ongoing communications continue to help Merck capitalize on areas of opportunity. You have worked hard recently to help them target managers and increase their manager reach. Not to mention you always bring the human element, whether it's celebrating Cheryl's birthday with a cake or bringing gigantic Whoopie Pies to celebrate a 30 Year Anniversary. Sheri - it's clear that you have gotten executive buy in across the organization and the team was so impressed with your suggestions on utilizing WARI. Michaela and Aaron were huge fans of the scorecard idea yesterday. Congrats to you three on an amazing partnership and another great review!\n\n191#Great work with Fannie Mae|Team, I wanted to call out your great work prepping for the on-site meeting with Fannie Mae today. They've been a great customer over the past 3 years, with best in class program metrics. But with their business type, they've also been on cruise control with a strict budget. Their interim CEO is now their official CEO, and they have a new CMO and CHRO. Reviewing their program metrics isn't enough. Greg shared some great slides that showed they have gender equity in recognition along with great manager and p2p participation. They were most interested in the information that showed that the current allocation of funds is directly impacting some of their most important departments and might not be the ideal way to distribute the funds. They also started to think about ways they can celebrate 'moments' within the platform and want to setup a brainstorming session soon. You all did great work prepping for and meeting with them today. I am looking forward to the next steps!\n\n192#Inspiring Greatness|Thank you to this incredible team of strategists for an impressive two (very) long days of concentrated best practice sharing, ideation, mind blowing progress on our dream state goals, and overall pure stamina. I was reminded again these last solid 48 hours exactly how much work you are doing and magic you are making at our most strategic customers. It is truly mind blowing what we can do as a team to impact the business. Thank you for your teamwork, your commitment to make the best of our time together, for helping to find the humor in some tough situations, and for being downright badass leaders. Each of you brought a perspective to our two day marathon that helped someone move an idea or a strategy forward. Each of you contributed your unique voice. Together, you make up the greatest team I’ve been privileged to work with. Onward to victory! Bravo!\n\n193#Client champions!|I wanted to give a heartfelt thank you to each of you for your help in providing insight and details re: our clients and their programs to help me prepare questions and slides for the Total Rewards Conference. The relationships you each have with Michaela (Merck), Ted (Autodesk), Darlene (Corning) and Amanda (Cardinal) contributed to our success in first getting them to be on the panel, and second to share compelling different stories to inspire the audience. From sharing important differentiators like Merck and Corning are very interested in the WARI D&I results to Corbrina, working with Ted in the last few days ensuring he was comfortable sharing his WARI data, I felt confident we would have unique insights to share to separate us from all the others in our space. Thank you all for your teamwork!\n\n194#GE Inspiration|Sheri---INCREDIBLE momentum with GE this week! Not only did you get some great humans to WH but they were anxious to get back together and get MOVING on making change. This email kind of blew me away...what a change in attitude and enthusiasm! Bravo!  \"Thank you Sheri!! You did a great job, giving the businesses just enough to digest. I can sense some excitement around the program again.    I’ve been thinking about the People Leader education piece. I think GE really missed the mark on this when rolling out the Impact Award Program. They are such an integral part of this. While we can implement a great program, we really need them to execute it properly. The fact that peer awards have declined and award approvals are happening primarily at year end, is a red flag. I think budgeting creating some panic around it as well. I’m excited to get a fresh start and deliver it more effectively on our end this time around.   Thanks for everything!\"\n\n195#Synchrony Prep and Homerun Meeting|Sheri, I want to call out the excellent work you've done over the past several weeks to prep our Conversations team on the Synchrony opportunity. Your very detailed business background, insights into Synchrony's culture and thinking, and knowledge about the people of Synchrony set us up for an incredible meeting. I am super impressed by the thoughtful microsite that you shared over that went VIRAL ahead of your big meeting. SO organized, so strategic, so well done! Way to inspire, guide, and position us!\n\n196#Dublin in 48 hours|Sheri, thank you for being a key part of & onsite for the recent ICON review meeting.  It's great working with you on this account and it was a wonderful opportunity to share Workhuman Live insights, discuss the current program, bring research & analytics opportunities to the fore and spend some time on their investment.  It was really beneficial having this meeting so close to Workhuman Live especially as the team received the Amplify award and renewed for another 3 years.  Thank you for the great work you do with this customer and the continued support!\n\n197#So.Dope.|Strategic Client Director/Badass Story Tellers/Moment Creators/Momentum Shifters---this week has been one for the ages. We set a goal to drive up attendance for WH19 with specific emphasis on executives that have voting power and influence on real change at our most strategic accounts. Not only did you all (y'all) slay those numbers but you dug in, got super focused, and created specific moments for each of those accounts to really experience what this WH movement is all about. Not a second went by at this 5 day shindig where you weren't all communicating, supporting, connecting, and engaging with some of the most influential people in Nashville. I could not be prouder of the master class level preparation and execution of your plans, the quality of the conversations had, the next level situational awareness and lightening speed with which you moved on openings, and the absolute delight I witnessed and heard directly from your clients. We thought we kicked off this year thinking about the Dream State but I believe we've just scratched the surface. Get some rest, sheroes, your limits just opened up again!\n\n198#Teva is now GLOBAL!|A more than two-year journey became a reality in just under two months...and it's all thanks to this amazing team! A huge thanks to each of you (and so many more I did not mention) for your specific role in helping Teva bring the new and improved Stars to over 43,000 employees across 60 countries. This relaunch included an entirely new look and feel for the site, a complete change in program design, the addition of 40 new languages including Hebrew (first client!), an entirely new communication strategy, and so much more. The new Program Manager was extremely aggressive in her plan to launch Stars in such a short time frame, but this team made it happen. In just a few days, there have been over 700 awards issued worth approximately $30K. Teva went through an extremely tough year of organizational change and uncertainty in 2018 and because of the work of all of you, we can honestly say that we are helping make 2019 a much brighter year for its employees. Well done all around!\n\n199#Acceleration Kickoff Team|A big thank you and much gratitude to the entire team involved in kicking off our global internal 'review' of our top 5 customers! It took many hours of prep to do the research, thinking, and reporting for each of your areas of expertise AND then several more hours to come together as a team and review all of the great insights.  Thank you for digging in, thinking BIG, and committing yourselves to this important effort. One more review meeting to go! With every call we've made some connections, identified some opportunities, and put ourselves in a better place strategically.  Great work!\n\n200#Impressing ADP|Sheri, Greg & Alan - I’m a little overdue on this, but I wanted to make sure you know how impressed and supported I felt by you as we collaborated on ADP’s 2018 program performance review. This was a rare opportunity to get in from of the executive sponsor, Rita Mitjans, and illustrate the impact of their recognition program on their business. Sheri, you led things off with a personalized, convincing overview of the Workhuman cloud - so convincing that it led Rita to request a demo of all the solutions they’re not currently using. This is a major opportunity to expand our relationship with them, and it wouldn’t have presented itself without your effective presentation. Alan & Greg, you then took it a step further with your in-depth analysis of how recognition happens at ADP across gender and departments. Rita was impressed enough to proactively bring up the possibility of connecting us with their People Analytics team for data sharing that can further enrich our analysis. This meeting was a major first step towards growing our relationship with ADP. Thank you once again for your hard work.\n\n201#Fast, Accurate, Inspiring Hands|For all of you lasered focused on all of the varied communications going out to our customers, THANK YOU! It's a race to Nashville and I am SO happy to have you all on our team! Lots of details and first impressions to be made and you are all making every effort to knock them out of the park.  YOU ROCK!\n\n202#Such a Welcoming Team|Okay it's a long time coming!  I wanted to thank all of you so much for welcoming me to the SCD team.  It is such a great team to be a part of and I can't thank you all enough for your assistance in making the transition.  All of your help, input, suggestions and guidance were, and still are, invaluable.  So very proud to collaborate and work beside all of you!\n\n203#Dream State|Excellent work preparing thoughtful action plans that map our work toward the dream state with all of our strategic customers. What an excellent QBR session! I challenged you all to think big and you blew me away. It’s hard to believe how much we discussed, developed, and dreamt up in just one day! It was possible because you all put the work in ahead of time. Having Rebecca and Traci join us and start to immediately aligning with our work was the icing on our Valentine cake! Well done all! Really proud to work with each of you!\n\n204#Let's Go Global|Sheri---it's happppppenING! Your sheer determination and incredibly well honed negotiation and persuasion skills have been exercised over the past several months with our friends at Teva Pharma. You created a vision for the team to fight to take this program to a truly global place.  You built incredible relationships and managed to get a key champion to visit us in Boston during the HOLIDAYS! And, what is most incredible and a true testament to your expertise, in a year where Teva was cutting costs by $2.2B, you got them to double down on recognition.  So well done, Sheri! Congrats on getting this baby over the \"finish line\"!\n\n205#We are going global!|Sheri, you have done an amazing job fostering relationships with the new team at Teva. The company has gone through such a transitional period, but with the help of your leadership and guidance, launching the Stars program globally is a top priority for senior leaders. We had a successful account review with the head of total rewards for North America, and you helped spearhead a conversation about the ROI of the program and how important it is at this tumultuous time at Teva. You also planned a full two days of meetings and activities for our new PM Yael, who traveled all the way from Israel to meet with our team and plan the global launch. Yael left yesterday feeling energized by all of our conversations (albeit a bit overwhelmed I’m sure!), and it was clear you two had formed a special bond in your time together. Thanks for being such a fantastic partner throughout this journey and I look forward to finally launching Teva globally in February!\n\n206#Filling the room and supporting the event|Chris, Alex, Dave, Tim, Vahagn, Marie and Sheri - Thank you for all your help in driving attendance and supporting the SPARK event at Ferring the other evening. We had close to 70 attendees from customers and prospects alike! The event could not have been as successful without your support of my efforts. This is what it's all about, TEAMWORK. If you had a prospect there I hope this helps move your deal along and if you had a customer there I hope this allows you to get closer to them. Cheers!\n\n207#Social Selling Star!|Great job being called out as the \"Winners of the Week\" during this Monday's session of Social Selling Training. Your module assignment completion set a great example for the team. Thanks for your enthusiastic participation in this initiative!\n\n208#Journeymapping Stars!|A sincere thank you on behalf of the CX Team for participating in our first ever journeymapping aimed at the buyers experience. Each of you represented core areas of our business and stepped into the shoes of our customers to provide deep insights to create a picture in time of our current state. Journeymapping is an extensive project that requires many! Every single phase of the journey is critical to our business, from first awareness to contracting… from launch to even potential shut downs. Thank you so much for your passionate participation and honest candor. It's a pretty amazing thing that we have to remind folks to table brainstorming or solutions so that we can first nail down the current state. To me, this shows how eager our people are to learn from our past, dip into research and data, to push the boundaries on innovation and to challenge the status quo so that Globoforce can be way above the pack. These sessions and your input will propel us forward in every single corner of the business to be more aware and aligned with each other and with our customers. That is powerful - THANK YOU!\n\n209#We finally did it!|We finally did it! After over a year of blood, sweat and tears, and multiple Program Managers, Hershey has finally signed the Amendment to add Service Timelines and Retirement Awards to their existing program. You were the brain behind all of this, with your amazing number crunching skills and countless spreadsheets. Actually, it was more like handwritten notes on random different pieces of paper;-) You did such an amazing job putting together and presenting multiple proposals and setting expectations with the new Program Manager. I could not have done it without your support! Congrats on a job well done, so thankful to have partnered with you throughout this entire process!\n\n210#Dream Team|Leslie, Sheri and John, thank you so much for your help in securing customers for the WorldatWork panel next year. If our session gets accepted, it would be another smashing success that would lead to many marketing opportunities down the road. Thanks for tapping into your contacts, your persistence and your partnership.\n\n211#Q4 Full Court Press|Shouting it out to the hardest working team in the league!  These past few months each and every person on this team has proven to be RELENTLESS about driving opportunities forward, boxing out our competitors, proactively shutting down potential threats to our business, and inspiring our largest customers to invest more in their WorkHuman cultures.  Bravo to all of you fighters!  Thank you for digging deep and reaching for the stars!\n\n212#These Are the Days|An incredible two days this week. We use this term QBR pretty loosely. We might have to think of a more realistic name like Quarterly Intensive Strategy and Physical Survival Challenge. Thank goodness we added a word class marathon runner to the team...In all seriousness, given the multitude of current active projects and opportunities, thank you each for so diligently preparing and delivering your portfolio reviews. It can be so tough to take your foot off the pedal and step back and dedicate time to big picture strategy and ideation but we all know how critical it is to our growth as individuals and to the growth of the business. Bravo on another excellent 2 day (!) session. Thank you for bringing your whole selves to these two days and holding your concentration for such an intensely long period!\n\n213#Growing ADP...|Traci & Sheri - As you know, we have a big opportunity to grow ADP's program via the addition of a true P2P program and Service Timelines. They're also on the brink of celebrating 1MM recognition moments in their current myMoment program. Thank you for all the hard work and thought you put into presenting a compelling communications strategy around each of these opportunities. It will go a long way towards helping the ADP team get the buy-in to move forward with the program additions, and ultimately launch them successfully. You guys are amazing, and I'm excited to be working with you on this account.\n\n214#Spreading Smiles at Hershey|Our first account review working together is finally over with! This has been a long time in the making...I think we actually started to plan this meeting at the end of last year! We spent countless  hours fine tuning this agenda to ensure we were going to make the most out of each and every minute we were there...and we did just that! In just a few short hours, we managed to cover a program overview, Service Timelines, Retirement Awards, Life Events, Conversations, WARI and much more. All of your hard work to get Kevin Walling, Hershey's CHRO in the room paid off as he not only blessed us with a hello, but sat down to have a real conversation about what was happening today at Hershey. Thanks to all of our prep (and ensuring we had the right data on 2018 usage), we were able to get his support in fixing the usage program! I really enjoyed working with you in preparation for our meeting- you taught me a lot while always making time for a good laugh!  On a less serious note, I thought this picture perfectly showcased our dear friend that we met at the airport on the way home! I think she definitely would have made her way up where the luggage goes for a nap if we weren't on such a small plane:-) Thanks again for all of your support! Look forward to all of the great things to come for the Hershey's Smiles  program!\n\n215#Creating Conversations with Merck|Team, thank you all for your expertise, anecdotal input and strategic direction with the recent Conversations review with the Merck team.  You all played such critical roles from the prep meetings, lending your amazing input and expertise to the client discussions and helping to develop strategies for the next steps we took from the meeting.  Merck is an important client in our Global Adopter program and we had some work to do as Merck was a few months in to their Conversations pilot.  As a result of your efforts we were able to craft some important questions for this meeting and leaving the Merck team with a number things to consider as the pilot progresses.  The Merck team was looking to understand some of the key learnings we've seen with other Conversations customers as well and having each of your unique perspectives was critically important at the meeting.    I truly appreciate everyone's contributions at the meeting and the follow up discussions that are underway now.  It is wonderful to be working with a team of true professionals who understand the importance of helping to drive the Conversations product with our customers.\n\n216#Ready for your close up!|In true Globoforce fashion, when I put the call out for photoshoot models, so many people jumped at the chance to help. A photoshoot like the one we held this week takes true teamwork and the work of many to be successful. I am truly appreciative for all of you who made time and were patient/flexible/available throughout the process. Thank you to those in scheduled shoots and for those I grabbed last minute who were willing to jump right in. The careers website is going to look AMAZING because of so many of you! We are going to have an incredible photo library of our incredible people doing incredible things. Thank you to all of you - I am truly grateful!\n\n"
"217#Evanta NYC Inner Circle|Team- You all never cease to amaze me! When I came to you and mentioned Evanta, nothing but positive comments come flooding my way! You want to reach to your prospects- strategizing on inviting them (whoever they may be), promoting through email and direct mail and representing Globoforce’s brand while at the event.  Weeks prior you join logistics calls, log into the app, read through the many documents I send you, asking questions and preparing yourself. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication that goes into making these a success!!\n\n218#It Takes a Village..|I want to thank all of you for inviting me to be a fly on the wall for Synchrony's Annual Review! Your teamwork and collaboration was apparent in the meetings leading up to the client meeting and also during. You all added great insights and action items to move Synchrony forward.  Kara-as the CSM you have created this great relationship with Dino over the past year. He is ready to take action and make changes like turning on the newsfeed, increasing mobile usage, streamlined manager communications and diving into the data to see opportunities.  Lauren-after hearing feedback on the India redemption options, you jumped at the opportunity to schedule a call to get feedback from the India team themselves.  Sheri-you provided great thought leadership around nominations and how increasing the \"giving\" in their company not only is a feel good benefit, but most importantly these individuals who are nominating are the people who know and look for the behaviors that are driving core values and success in the company. Dino said \"I have never thought of it that way\". Great feeling to actually have these points validated!  Great work team and can't wait to hear what the future will bring for Synchrony's program!\n\n219#QBR Quality|Thanks to each of you for coming to our 2nd quarter reviews fully loaded and ready to dig in.  The degree to which you prepared, focused all of us on the keys to success in your individual portfolios, and articulated the opportunities was truly outstanding.  It's not easy to sit through an 8 hour meeting and we certainly didn't---we powered through and really leveraged our time together.  So much great work happening!  Looking so forward to our progress at every step!  Cheers to the best team in the business!\n\n220#Continuing to build strong relationships!|Thank you for being part of the KPMG review meeting last week.  We have worked with this customer for 10 years now and the team really value our expertise, it was great to have you share your experience from WorkHuman and Sara definitely feels inspired to join us next year. Sheri, you did a wonderful job sharing the research/trends and being a trusted advisor with stories from working with other customers. Nell, it was great to have you on site with us and thank you for the role you played in this meeting and on this account.  We are in a good place and have an opportunity to build on what has been achieved to date but also instill some of our key learnings re programme design, here's to the next exciting chapter!\n\n221#Moving Conversations Forward at Fannie Mae|Naomi, Lynne, and Sheri - great meeting yesterday at Fannie Mae with the Conversations program team.  With Phase 1 of their pilot complete, we took the opportunity to go onsite for a debrief of the program and discuss the strategy as we look to begin Phase 2.  Fannie Mae had previously held focus group sessions with their pilot teams and this was a great chance for us to learn from them on what employees thought of the program.  There was a lot of great feedback collected that we can now use as we move forward.  Although Fannie Mae took more of a \"hands off\" approach during Phase 1, they now realize that the key to success will be \"Prescription and Accountability.\" They even suggested themselves that for Phase 2, they will make a bigger splash in communicating the launch as well as continuing the communications throughout the pilot.  It's always great to have a customer come to these realizations themselves which means we are all on the same page moving forward.  Although they still have some final decisions to make internally with both Phase 2 and beyond, this was another big step in moving our partnership forward with the Conversations team.  Thank you all for your efforts and continued support through Fannie Mae's Conversation journey, I greatly appreciate it\n\n222#Support on MasterCard|Sheri- it was difficult to just pick one of our core values, because you really covered them all! Thank you so much for jumping in to support me on an amazing opportunity that I am working on for MasterCard. We have the attention of their EVP of Global Total Rewards right now to grow their recognition program to possibly 1-2% of payroll, and we needed to build a business to tell this story in less than 6 slides...and to do all of this within a 2 day turnaround  I had over 10 decks up on my laptop when trying to figure out the right slides to include here, but needed some help organizing my thoughts. You got on a call with me, listened to what the opportunity was/ a background on the account, and somehow turned around an amazing story in less than 2 hours! You then helped me craft a meaningful message to send in addition to the slides, which was just perfect! In just a few sentences, we were able to demonstrate how strategic recognition not only reinforces the values of a company, but also has been found to be one of the least expensive levers to make an impact on an employee's experience at work. Only two days after sharing this information, my main contact, the VP of Total Rewards, Rosanne was able to secure a meeting with the EVP of Global Total Rewards & the Business Financial Officer of HR. During this meeting, Rosanne's goal is to use this data to not only secure additional funding for this year to support the activity levels that have far exceeded their budget thus far for 2018, but to set up the proper investment for 2019. When I asked if she thought we were going to have any pushback in getting additional funding for 2018, the VP said absolutely not! In fact, she is thrilled to kick off a partnership with WorkHuman Research Institute Team to further build the case with their own data. All of this is possible because of you, and your support in this crucial time. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n223#Some Sweet Opportunity at Fannie Mae|Sheri, congrats on making an incredible executive opportunity happen at Fannie Mae.  You managed to make May 3rd the day that Globoforce owned at FM!  I believe there were at least 6 hours plus some social time!  The only hours you missed were breakfast and dinner---although you did hit happy hour on-site with the executive team! And, in those hours of meetings, you managed to hit on all of the critical strategic opportunities that they have to make the Beat even more impactful. You managed a great meeting with the very executives that are driving the culture and the change management going on right now at FM, to include their new CHRO.  Great work getting the right meetings and making the most of them!  What a sweet treat!\n\n224#Room Monitor Extraordinaire|Thank you again to this team for being A+ room monitors at WorkHuman. By room monitor I mean speaker greeter, breakout room emcee, liaison to the AV tech, seat filler, and time keeper. With 80+ speakers it takes a village to ensure each one has the support they need during their session. For some of you it meant getting on stage in front of 1,000+ people and for others it was editing introduction talking points last minute to meet the ever changing needs of our speakers. You each had a packed schedule meeting with customers/prospects on-site and still fulfilled these instrumental roles. I had speakers asking for the names of their room monitors in hopes of finding you again to thank you in person, which is remarkable. Thank you!\n\n225#Making it All Happen at WH|Congrats to this amazing team for coming to WorkHuman with your roller skates on! There were so many key executives and influencers attending this year, I think all of us wondered how we would possibly get to all of them.  But throughout these 4 days all of the preparation and organization paid off as I witnessed each of you make key meetings, key conversations, and key introductions happen for our customers as well as our prospects.  Thank you for committing yourselves from morning till nighttime to taking full advantage of this incredible forum.  Could not have been more proud of your work this week!\n\n226#The Art of Being Brilliant|Thank you all for your support, expertise and collaboration at the HARMAN Account Review this week.  Each of you played a vital role in the success of the meeting.  We were able to address a number of items the program team was looking to cover discuss opportunities for the future and celebrate the success around the first year of the Be Brilliant program.  Your feedback and comments during the meeting were so helpful in driving the program forward.  It was great having you all participate in our the cupcake celebration decked out in our HARMAN t-shirts.  Thank you to each of your for your support with this program.\n\n227#Moving the NBCU needle!|What an amazing job you have done moving the needle with NBCU! You have driven 50+ NBCU attendees to WorkHuman, over 30 of them are VP plus and on the Exec track and today you secured their agreement to be featured in both video and photos to promote future teams at WorkHuman! What an amazing job you have done moving the NBCU needle! I look forward to seeing the results post WorkHuman!! Thank you Sheri!\n\n228#Growth Plans|Well done today during the Customer Success QBRs! Not only was the whole team prepared but you all contributed to helping your peers capitalize on opportunities for growth and closer customer relationships. Your focus on crowdsourced pay and Conversations was evident and you’re all doing great work on getting the right people to WorkHuman. Great planning and I look forward to seeing all the great results later this year.\n\n229#Team Pave Rocks!|Team Pave, I just wanted to recognize the time you have all taken to “show me the ropes” since I joined Globoforce. Onboarding can be both exciting and daunting, but from the very beginning you have made me feel welcomed on our team and gone above and beyond to make sure I have all the support and resources I need to do a great job. You have let me shadow you in client meetings, carved out time for 1:1 calls and shared your knowledge and experience, all while handling massive relaunches, negotiating crucial RFPS and managing complex accounts. I’m extremely fortunate to have you all as colleagues and I look forward to the day that I can follow the example you have all set in helping the next SCD feel grounded and supported. HUGE THANK YOU for everything that you have all done to help me!\n\n230#NBCU Rock Star!|Sheri, this award is long overdue!  If I look up \"Go Getter\", your smiling face would certainly be the first thing to pop up.   NBCU has been a client for almost 5 years and we haven't been able to make any headway with getting their executive team to speak with us, show any interest in the program, attend meetings/calls, come to events, etc.  You have proven that sometimes it takes just picking up the phone to make things happen. It's amazing how far we've come in a year now that you've established a relationship with Vicki, their SVP of Compensation & Benefits. From onsite meetings to WorkHuman you are turning her (and hopefully her team and extended teams) into a champion partner for Globoforce.  Time will tell where we end up with this client but we are 100% in a better place now than we've ever been before...due to your leadership.   I couldn't ask for a better partner on  this journey!!!\n\n231#Ready for Hollywood!|Sitting in front of the camera to record a video for our WH18 Award winners is no easy task. I wanted to thank you for thoughtfully crafting your script and giving us your time and effort on Sunday to record that heartfelt, congratulatory message. You were amazing and this year at the conference, our winners are going to be so touched to see/hear these messages. Thank you!!\n\n232#Never say never!|Sheri - Great job on quickly identifying urgent issues and risk with the Fannie Mae project for Conversations! Your timely escalation, prep and execution with right set of key stakeholders a meeting with Fannie Mae resolved their urgent issues with Conversations. This is the kind of client leadership and drive that makes a new business successful!\n\n233#It Takes A Village!|Sheri, Mirfie, John, Leslie and Marie,  I want to thank each of you for taking the time to sit with me one-on-one during my first few weeks to share your insights, wisdom and experiences. Your direction and guidance has been invaluable in helping me get acclimated to my role and to Globoforce. I know there's still much to learn and I'm grateful to have such a supportive and skilled group to glean from.\n\n234#Teva SuperSTAR|Sheri, thank you so much for being such a fantastic partner throughout the Teva account review. Teva is going through an extremely tough time financially right now, with lots of unknown factors about where the organization is going and whether or not many of them will even have jobs in the new year. When Teva nearly canceled our account review due to these factors, you convinced them of the value meeting with us could bring, as we can help arm them with resources and research to help defend the program, should it come down to that. They not only agreed to keep the meeting, but the executive sponsor was present for the entire session, and found the research and data we had to share very compelling and helpful. Due to your convincing presentation, we will hopefully even be able to get their annual performance data to help run an ROI analysis on high performers and ensure they are kept happy and engaged throughout the difficult times ahead. Thanks again and I look forward to continuing to partner with you to ensure that despite the challenges, Teva has a successful STARS program in 2018!\n\n235#Conversations at Fannie Mae|Congratulations on your work to secure Fannie Mae as a Global Adopter for Conversations!  This not only required surviving a change in key personnel at the client but also overcoming several other competing options to ensure that Conversations was the technology of choice for their performance management evolution.  Well done!\n\n236#ATeam killing it @ WWWH NYC'17|Team  - amazing work done by you all during the event at last night's 4th NYC WWWH'17 event in NYC.  Each of you engaged several prospects and clients during both the cocktail hour and dinner and had many wonderful conversations ranging from D&I, Social Recognition, Global Coverage, Crowd Sourced Performance, and many others!  Our prospects all had a wonderful time and stated they can't wait to do it again next time.  many stayed late and missed trains to go home later because they were having such a wonderful time.  We need to keep that momentum moving along and now team Brevinicci will run with the ball and bring these deals home.  Well done team!\n\n237#HE Tech Super Stars|Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to staff HR Tech this year.  Several things happened, we had a brand new booth with new activations, a new product announcement, and additional hands that were experts on our new product Conversations.  You all handled it like we go out this way every month.  Everyone jumped in to have discussions, help people with our various activations (spin the wheel, answer a question and get some candy) and scanned everyone that came within inches of our carpet.  We even had a small group come through and Ken held their undivided attention for 5 minutes (that was as long as we could keep them) for a special expo hall tour.  Everyone worked well together and when something popped up, you made sure that someone was there to cover if you needed to step away.  Thank you!\n\n238#Repeatedly Smooth Handoffs @ HR Tech|Conversations experts just a quick thank you for being in the booth and ready to jump in whenever needed last week for prospect inquiries about Conversations.  I had several great discussions with prospects about both Recognition and Conversations and when it will be time to get to let them hear from another SME each of you was around to answer questions and make the prospect feel even more important.  Great teamwork guys!\n\n239#Fannie Mae Conversations|Sheri, this is to recognize your efforts in getting Fannie Mae to sign on as a Global Adopter of Conversations.  Even with Fannie Mae's Program Manager leaving the company earlier this summer, you had built enough relationships and knew how to navigate through their organization to make sure the appropriate people at Fannie Mae came together to learn about Conversations.  After a great Design Lab yesterday, we've now tapped into 2 different teams at Fannie Mae and our relationship with them continues to build.  Thanks so much for your efforts in getting them to sign and I'm really looking forward to continue working with you on this customer.\n\n240#And the Beat goes on ...|Great job at Fannie Mae's Conversations design lab yesterday, team! We operated like a finely-tuned Conversations machine, despite having never worked together before! Our GF messaging came through smoothly, the FM team felt like we really heard them, and we left them poised for spectacular success. Thank you for everything you did to prepare, set the stage, nurture the relationship, ask the right questions, and -mostly- for respecting the quality of our product and our process!\n\n241#Hologic Onsite Review|Sheri this is an overdue thank you for joining Meghan and I onsite at Hologic! Although this is a smaller account you didn't hesitate at all when I asked if you could attend and present our ROI slides. Not only did you attend but you were also a sounding board as I was pulling together the client data and prepping.  The meeting went great, the ROI slides were very well received and hopefully this brings us a step closer to getting their leadership team on board with social recognition. Thanks again!!\n\n242#Inspiring Icon|Melanie & Sheri thank you both for joining me at the recent ICON meeting. It was late in the day when we were informed of the change to the company values so Melanie thank you so much for joining the meeting but also pulling together content and slides that were most impactful. Sheri, it was great to have you join as we continue to build relationships with the right people. Orla was really interested in the research that you shared and it helps the team at ICON understand how Inspire can really make a difference. 2018 should be a big year for ICON as they continue to see the benefit and focus more on Inspire. Thank you for such wonderful support!\n\n243#Persitance Pays Off|Thank you so much for all of your help getting the NBCU contract FINALLY signed!  You kept on top of everyone from both sides in order to keep the process going and gently pushed folks when needed.  Great job!\n\n244#NBCU next gen|Excellent work securing, preparing for and executing in today's exec meeting with NBCU. Because of your thoughtful follow up after WH17 and diligent preparation, we found ourselves helping reinvent recognition at NBCU, another candidate for our 1% research project, multiple features adopted and a great ongoing executive relationship. Great work!\n\n245#Engaging Nokia!|Sheri thank you for joining the Nokia meeting. It was a great opportunity to introduce you to the account & meet Nicole in person. Thank you for travelling to Paris for such a brief trip to be part of this. You did an excellent job sharing the work we have done with other customers in terms of their data & the trends we have seen with regards to recognition and retention and performance. You really engaged the team and provided compelling reasons why Nokia should partner with us in a similar manner & also benefit from such insight. You did a wonderful job, thank you!  I hope you at least got to see the Eiffel tower but just in case :)\n\n246#WorkHuman Room Monitor and Scanner SUCCESS Team!|Otherwise known as the \"turning chaos into an incredible experience\" team! Thank you all for your tremendous work at WorkHuman to manage the Spotlight sessions and make the experience positive, engaging and meaningful for all attendees. While \"chaos\" might be a bit strong, what you did was exceptional. Thrown in at the deep end with minimal training you: * Funneled everyone safely into sessions they were interested in seeing (including redirecting some on the fly) * Scanned badges to help inform even greater sessions next year * Kept sessions running on time and on track * Introduced speakers in a way that excited attendees on what they were about to see and hear * Led Q&A (and ran mics) for truly interactive, human sessions * Basically, pulled double and triple duty in a way that made the experience seamless and perfect for our attendees  Thank you all for everything you did - including dealing with questions and issues on the fly and with little direction - to make WorkHuman GREAT!\n\n247#Smiling @Hershey's Exec Event|Sheri - Great job last week at the Hershey exactly prevent for their charity function. You did a wonderful job mingling, meeting, and greeting with the senior executives from Hershey's. You were also great in representing Globoforce and networking with other leaders from other companies such as one of the best executive recruiters for senior HR leaders in the country. It wonderful job was great to have you there and look forward to working more together in the future.\n\n248#Key Additions to WH Panel!|Sheryl and Mirfie - thank you for all of your help and awesome efforts to secure Vicki Williams (NBCU) and Kim Bors (Schneider Electric) for the panel at WorkHuman.  This panel is a key part of our WorkHuman content agenda and we needed to add a couple of customers. You stepped up and delivered!  Thank you for your sense of urgency and commitment to helping making WorkHuman amazing in 2017.\n\n249#Synchronous Activities|Sheri, great job getting us in front of the SVP at Synchrony last week.  Despite his best efforts to slip away, you kept on top of the situation and made sure he gave us an audience.  And what a difference it will make!  Using the outcome data we've collected, this meeting changed the way that Synchrony looks at and thinks about recognition.  It never would have been possible without your creativity and persistence in getting us to the table.  Well done!\n\n250#Fannie Maestro|Sheri, I knew when you joined us that we were hiring a true pro. Working together on the Fannie Mae data, exec meeting prep and on the day execution Only reaffirmed that we made the right choice. Everyone was prepared, on message and we could have spent 4 more hours with them. Lots of great discussions and lots of ideas for the future. Well done and keep it up.\n\n251#A beautiful mind!|Sheri, It has been such a pleasure having you on \"The Beat Team\" for Fannie Mae.  We're working with them on 1-year anniversary celebrations and you've played a key part in supporting our internal team and the program team @ FNMA.  You've had innovative ideas not only on the anniversary, but on the impending ROI results and how their stats relate to the employee experience.  It's all going to tie everything together perfectly.   Welcome to the team and thanks sharing great ideas with us!\n\n252#A new uber driver???|Thank you so much for driving back and forth to Corning.  You truly enabled me to keep several client calls as well as respond to emails (and submit some Globostars).  It was so much fun getting to know you (and Walter, and your daughters, and your music) better.  I look forward to hopefully many more trips with you on other accounts!\n\n253#The first of many steps...|Sheri, congratulations on passing through the first gates towards success by delivering a great demo and CHRO pursuit/meeting strategy.  It's clear you have spent a lot of thoughtful time preparing and working with other experts to bring yourself up to speed.  Great work and I'm excited to see the impact you are sure to bring to some of our biggest accounts!\n\n254#Creating Value & Opportunity|Sheri - Thank you so much for your thoughtful approach in helping me turn a simple Power of Thanks book request into an opportunity for Globoforce to speak to 100 of American Airlines employees from their global HR Team! You helped me look beyond  the book request to create greater value for both our prospect and us - which is exactly what team work is all about. I'm so grateful to be working with you again (company number 2) and look forward to seeing the positive impact that I know you'll have on our customers and the company as a whole.\n\n255#Thank you for making the on-boarding process fun!|Kara, Sheri and Lynne - I really enjoyed spending time with you all this week for the on-boarding process.  I appreciate how engaged and observant you were during all of our informational sessions.  And I loved all of the thoughtful questions you asked.  You all certianly helped me learn more about Globoforce.  Good luck to you all and I look forward to celebrating our milestones together!  - Martha\n\n256#Great start!|Sheri, congratulations on your first week at Globoforce!  I can see already that you're going to fit right in and grasp our key messaging in no time.  \"And more recognition is better!\"  That quote during our key account strategy conversation yesterday showed me how quickly you have assimilated the investment in recognition ideas we have been discussing.  Great start and I'm looking forward to great things from you!\n\n"
