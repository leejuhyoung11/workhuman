"0#Making the Impossible, Possible|Marketing team and partners - Congratulations on achieving a monumental milestone of 50,000 Marketing Qualified Leads! By the numbers, this milestone represents two-year growth from 8,000 in 2020 to 50,636 (and climbing)! That’s an incredible 532% increase in demand growth in just two years' time!     The journey to this massive accomplishment started back in October 2021 with thoughtful and intense demand and brand planning, pragmatism of breaking big goals into smaller channel by quarter forecasts and plans, followed by superior discipline around performance management week on week, and critically aided by our partnerships with Sales Ops, Analytics, and Enterprise Architecture.     From web leads, to webinars, social surrounds, press amplification, Spotlights, and countless hours refining the leads scoring and ingestion models, this was a department wide effort through and through. As impressive as this achievement of goal (ahead of schedule) is, more than the outcome itself, it’s demonstrative of your collective discipline, collaboration, and commitment to quality execution. We’ve learned much from this journey that will inform and enable success in fy23 and beyond.     On behalf of the Senior Exec Leadership Team, congratulations on making the impossible, possible!    -Tom\n\n1#Events budgets|Jenn, thank you so much for sending on the budgets and taking me over them and having all the detail . This makes it easier for me to follow and see if we are missing any costs. Also thank you for taking my call and going through it all.\n\n2#Always looking out for me!|Jenn - thank you so much for taking the time to mail back an item of mine that went MIA.

It feels like things are beginning to gel between our overall team responsibilities and how we each individually contribute.  Regan, Jenn - thank you so much for making an extra trip so we could spend more time together in person and Madison for all you are doing every day to help ramp us all up.  It was time well spent together this week, and I'm excited to see we are getting further planned out and working on new endeavors as we begin to push into 2023 and beyond!  I'm looking forward to the road ahead - thanks for all you do!\n\n4#Thank you doesn't feel enough!!|I want to give a MASSIVE shout out to this incredible, hard-working group while we prepare for the logistics at our ELT offsite in just a week!

No small feat, especially with a major pivot to completely overhaul and change the approach for our offsite with only 2.5 weeks notice.  Within days you had the whole offsite re-mapped and any of the minor overages were simply a function of extreme last minute changes.  I am so impressed by the work you each do every day, juggling many different timescales, events and vendors all at the same time, and for things you accomplish both seen and unseen.  Thank you for your tremendous commitment to excellence and SO excited for all there is to come this year and beyond!\n\n6#All the safety things|Jenn, As we get close to Workhuman Live in Atlanta - thank you for everything you've done on the Health & Safety work. Leading weekly meetings, sourcing vendors, managing contracts, masks masks masks. All of this on top of your 'day job' of planning other events, and the every changing policies around Covid. Oh, and special guests chiming in! YOU were the perfect person for this monumental task, and you've managed it with your usual humor, style, and pragmatism. Cheers to you!\n\n7#All things WHL|THANK YOU so much for keeping the EA team in the loop on all things WHL.

We urgently change direction and switched the location and format with only days to spare and you guys jumped in and pulled together facilities, agendas, entertainment and logistics. On a very large scale! The logistics of getting everyone to the event and making the days run smoothly went without a hitch. It gave us all a foundation to have fantastic discussions that were hugely valuable. I promise not to change locations at the last minute ever again! Well done and thank you. It was an unequivocal success!\n\n9#Sales Club Trip!|Regan & Jenn thank you so much for all your incredible work to set up an amazing sales club trip in Mexico this week.

Thank you -- we had a successful, productive, engaging and fun team meeting planning our alignment to critical goals in 2022. Jenn,  I appreciate you helping coordinate logistics, the abundance of F&B, the bougie app and your thoughtful arrangements. Kathy, your  restaurant recommendation was spot on for food, vibe - you knew what I wanted and needed, thank you for your local advice. Steve you’ve just been an all around terrific supporter enabling these valuable get togethers year after year, working with me right up to the day I touched down on the investment in our people. Jason, you immediately supported me when I asked to host my annual offsite, and gave the team advance insight to our 2022 Sales Strategy Board so the team could ask questions, and be that much more effective in our get together. Tom, you worked to get org changes solidified, personally reviewing with us in advance fielding questions so we can best align the SAs to regions, leaders, reps and markets with new members on our team and yours. Kerri, helping me ensure we were all systems go in lightening speed! Maggie, thx for helping me theme it out and build a template for the morning exercise; Marcy -- the jerseys!

I appreciate your teamwork, your leadership and above all- your partnership and sense of humor through it all!\n\n15#Customer Acquisition Dream Team!|I could not be more proud of or grateful for all of you and the great work you've done over the last year. It goes without saying that it's been quite the year, and the way you have rallied, showed up, stepped up and worked together is unbelievable. What stands out most to me is your unwavering determination to drive our business forward while adjusting to being fully remote, while managing kids of all ages, parents, pets, and Covid life in general.  On top of adjusting to a new way of life, we've introduced so many new elements to our team this year - a new ICP, tiers, personas, verticals, playbooks, lead scoring, new humans, new structure, and new leaders! You have risen to the challenge and produced a truly impressive body of work - ten of millions of paid media impressions, millions of emails sent, outstanding webinars featuring Bay State, Citizens, and Merck,  impactful virtual events, and smart and strategic 1:1 ABM programs to engage our priority accounts and accelerate opportunities! You have all done a great job doing all of this in partnership with Brand, Sales, CS, Cx, and beyond, while continuing to think creatively and bring fresh ideas to your programs and to each other!

You were 100% on top of the program, drove the meeting agenda, and had specific milestone dates for planning, execution and new sales training.

Thank you, both, for your great work!\n\n18#Teamwork makes that dream work|Hey Jenn,  Thank you for continuing to provide top-notch support in the East / West territories.

Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring!

As it was my first it will hold lots of moments that mattered - great content, beautiful scenery, radical candor, and a dancing lite-brite man on stilts (what?!). Further, I wanted to recognize the great support and responsiveness you demonstrated as various team members needed to rapidly change travel plans - as one of those folks I want to emphasize how important that flexibility was to feel “good” about my family situation while staying focused on the tasks at hand at the offsite. With gratitude, -C\n\n26#Site Visit Specialists|Team, just wanted to take a moment to recognize all that goes into planning every aspect of an event like WH Live, the site visits are no exception.... multiple threads, tasks, logistics, decisions and lots and lots of walking.

Whether it was big or small, you all went above and beyond to make sure it was a success - excellent teamwork and collaboration throughout!

You three worked together as a team to make sure everything was aligned and it was greatly appreciated by all attendees! Great Work and good luck next week for round 2!\n\n32#Ignite Core Team|It’s hard to decide which value to recognize the members of the Ignite Core team for.  There was a commitment to teamwork, quality and our internal customers.  Colleen and I decided to go with Respect for Urgency since you all worked so hard to pull this event together in a very short time.  Jenn S and Melissa – no idea how you were able to find 33 restaurants to host dine-a-rounds, pull off the amazing Gold party, and all the other details that somehow came together in weeks.  Mark – not sure how you stay so calm as we’re constantly changing slides, the agenda and all the other technical needs.  Somehow you did and were able to deliver an amazing experience for our humans.  Jenn P – Again, in an incredibly short time, you were able to visualize and produce some engaging activations to enhance the experience for all.  Aimee – you were willing to step in and do whatever needed to be done, including taking care of a team member who was ill.  Lauren, Kate, Sarah, and Niamh – your partnership and responsiveness as we constantly looked for input, approvals, etc. was second to none.  Your guidance and energy were key to this process.  Thank you all and we look forward to working with you to make the Dublin experience amazing!\n\n33#Partner and Collaborator Who Always Has Our Back!|Thank you, thank you, thank you Jenn for being such an amazing partner, collaborator and friend for the Strategy & Consulting team and me personally!

We couldn't have met our deadline without your quick assistance.\n\n37#See it to believe it!|If you come from previous toxic work environments, it takes a little while to adjust to Workhuman. In my first two months I have witnessed first-hand what it's like to have a supportive and understanding boss - of not just the craziness of a new job and a million questions,  but of life outside of work... of what #WeWorkHuman is really about that. Thank you!\n\n38#Workhuman's 2019 Workday Rising Experience|Thanks for the outstanding, behind the scenes efforts, that empowered our team to deliver a great experience at this year's Workday Rising event!

We put our lead generation scanner through it's paces and couldn't be more pleased with how the experience came together for so many potential prospects who are now eager for our follow up:)  We even had a handful of customers who couldn't resist stopping by to say hello and of course asked that we pass along their thanks and appreciation to the countless members of our broader team who've positively influenced and continue to support the ongoing success of their programs. So embedding this broader congrats and thank you to the entire Workhuman team!\n\n39#Leader of the Pack|Jenn, yet another successful tradeshow!

This was the first time I was able to partner with you, and it really was so much fun.  Thank you for your commitment to this search.  Your quick communication, prioritization and honesty through this process were key to making successful hired.  Along the way, you made it fun and kept me laughing!  Thank you for teaching me about your world, and what it takes to be successful in events.  This insight was so helpful for me when I screened candidates.

You made the day go smoothly and was such a great turn out for a great cause :)\n\n43#What an Event!!|MaryJo, Jenn and Mark – thank you so much for all the hard work and effort that went into this year’s bootcamp.  I can confidently say that absolutely no rock went unturned and every detail was accounted for.  From the venue and activities to the agenda to the quality of content to the technical logistics – everything went without a hitch.  I can’t thank you enough for the countless hours spent planning, practicing, dry-running, tweaking…all of the effort certainly did not go unnoticed and it was because of you that we had such an outstanding event this year.  From me and everyone that had the pleasure of joining the event - thank you!!\n\n44#Success!|Jenn, I want to take a second to not only thank you but congratulate you on yet another Success event!

For me, being able to lead this program is my favorite responsibility to the Company and having you side by side throughout this entire journey has simply been a pleasure.  When I announced the very first SLC and many people did not know the impact it would have on our colleagues.  Now, this initiative is a revered event that everyone looks forward to and hopes to participate in.  The quality of the program that you put together is outstanding and only gets better every year.  From the first trip to San Diego, to this year's effort in Punta Cana, you have left all the attendees wow-ed.  Jenn, I have been able to watch your talents at work and I want to thank you for always giving your all to make Sales Leadership Club the special event that it is.\n\n48#Sales Leadership Club|I just wanted to take the time to thank you both for such a great experience at Club.  Everything was outstanding, from the accommodations to the food, entertainment and activities.  It truly made for a special experience for all who were lucky enough to attend.  Jenn, you're a true pro at what you do, and Ben, your preparation for Friday night's presentations was so thoughtful.  This trip will definitely go down as one of my best Workhuman memories!\n\n49#Grateful Heart|Jenn- I cannot thank you enough for your dedication to making club such and amazing experience! You truly were ON the whole trip, from the multiple emails we all received before departing with a very cool yearbook so we could familiarize ourselves with everyone to customized itineraries of our 4 days. When we arrived, you graciously welcomed us into the resort- taking care of extra charges for extending my trip (wasn’t happening), to ensuring you answered my many texts and calls throughout the 4 days. Throwing welcome receptions and farewell dinners in between and sending us off, clearing up charges not incurred for a handful of us. I hope you enjoy some R&R because you truly deserve it. My heart is grateful. Thank you!\n\n50#Contracts 101|Jenn – I wanted to take a moment to recognize you for helping me with the SLT off-site contract process. You took time out of your busy schedule to meet with me and walk me through the contract process in detail noting what I should look for in a contract, what’s standard in contract and highlighted what our Legal team looks for as well.  This was extremely helpful, and I couldn’t have done this without you!! Thank you so much for always answering all my constant questions  -  I greatly appreciate you!! You rock!!\n\n51#I’s dotted and T’s crossed|Hi Jennifer, i would like to thank you for taking the time out to help close out the analysis on the Gforce20 spend.

Thanks again and enjoy!\n\n52#Persona Workshop Warriors Unite!|I have such a grateful heart for this day, this entire team of Marketing mavens, and all the opportunities that sit within our reach. I have never felt more connected to our team than I do at this very moment. We just completed an all hands, all day persona workshop! Woohoo!!! Thank you for your investment. Thank you for being a kind audience that stayed engaged. Thank you for asking thoughtful questions. Thank you for your humor and your patience. Thank you for being real. Thank you for embracing the 7 1/2 hour marathon persona training session we shared today with gusto and heart! I truly believe that we will be a better team, and we will produce better marketing because of the time we spent together today. I can’t wait to hear your feedback about the agenda, the learning modules, the wiki….ALL the things! I can’t wait to apply this first body of persona work to our marketing efforts. Let’s GOOOOOOO!\n\n53#The Women behind the Curtian|Jennifer, last week at Workhuman I barely saw you because you were taking care of all things behind the scenes! I got a sneak peak of what your day looked like when I had to run up to make sure an important prospect was in line for a Meet N Greet! Flavin was concerned she wouldn't make the list and I reached out to you to make sure. By the time I got upstairs you already texted me back saying you took care of it. I would have to say this is the type of worker you are. No matter how busy you are with 50 million things going on, if I am stuck in a jam and text you or call you quickly come up with a solution or send help my way! The leadership you bring to the table everyday for myself and everyone around you is impeccable! The meet n greets went so smoothly along with all things security last week at Workhuman and we have you to thank for tremendous leadership!!!\n\n54#Sharing all the Workhuman things!|I wanted to take a moment, before we head to Nashville to recognize each of you for all your help making sure we shared information with employees so they know what's going on in terms of their travel to and in Nashville, their roles on site, the guidelines around meals, etc. If I actually had an excel with every little detail it would be thousands of rows worth. I cannot count how many questions I've asked each of you, and you always respond quickly and with the info I need. In particular, our biggest work was the training for all staff going to TN - a wee 70-something slide deck. The team did a great job delivering, answering questions, and just being prepared in general. You've been great partners to the internal comms team and I am excited to see all of your work come to life next week. Thank you!\n\n55#Belated GF20 THANK YOU!|Hey team, I am sorry to be so belated in thanking each and every one of your for your tremendous contribution to the executional excellence that was GF20! In the weeks since, I have heard nothing but amazing feedback on everything from the office tours (the logistics on that must have been mind-blowingly complex!) to the day itself (so inspiring and engaging!) to the final evening, (a party that no one will ever forget!). Thank you for pulling together to create an experience that allowed us to celebrate the amazing story of this company, spend time together and bond over our exciting future. I know there were a million details, stresses and little things you fussed over, but no one saw you sweat. You did a great job. Thank you!\n\n56#GFORCE20 Rockstars|Looking back at the amazing event that was GFORCE20, I started to reflect on where we started and how it build out over the last 6 months, to the amazing ending in the Mansion House. From sourcing the secret venue, the pre site visit months in advance, to the idea of a guest speaker over dinner, the many logistic meetings, reviewing around 30 different type of fleeces and elephants :) to what should go on the lanyards, the various graphics, printouts etc! And of course pulling together to handle the last minute changes!  Most people don't see what goes on behind the scenes or the late nights to get everything prepped and ready - it really does take a village - so well done and thank you all for the amazing experience :)\n\n57#Great Collaboration!|I don’t know how you do this, but I am so impressed by you both. I had such a great time working with you, and trying to keep a very complicated project like this on the rails was truly one of the most challenging things I’ve ever done. Thank you for being such great partners, Lets do it again!! haha\n\n58#Gala Set Up|Whelp, we had a short period of time to get a million things accomplished and set for perfection the night of the Gala! We were running around up until seconds of people arriving but we worked together as a team to get it all done! From table tents being set up in Alphabetical order in a very small space (multiple times), to setting each menu/agenda on each table setting (450 seats), to organizing the arrival of Entertainment, cuing up slides with the Mansion House production team, setting up 2 huge graphic timelines, and zipping up/buttoning up our dresses and shirts with no time to space. We all did this as a team and with a smile on our faces! Thank you for all your help and support. We even manged to sit down as a team and enjoy dinner together! Thanks again for all your help to make the Gala a successful evening!\n\n59#YOU made work more human|Jenn, just after the amazing GForce wrapped up, you saw me at the start of the exec offsite and made a big effort to come to my aid to help me combat a nasty head cold. At that moment I had neither the energy or the time to deal with it...so thank you for looking after me. You made a huge difference, especially on the flight home where I managed to feel ok enough to get through. The first thing I said to my husband was \"thank God for Jenn, she saved me.\" So thank you for that personal care.\n\n60#The Force behind GForce 20|What an incredible few days!  I am so grateful for the group that helped pull this important event together.  Your enthusiasm, passion, hard work and tenacity throughout the process of building this anniversary celebration was awesome.  We had so much to deal with;   \"secret news\", time zone and cultural differences (what does a \"band\" refer to??), an update to the Dublin office,  and a huge responsibility to get this right.  Thank you for putting your  heart and soul into this program, and making it something we will all remember.  Congratulations to all of you!\n\n61#When every word matters|Thank you both for your help in providing all the content for the material created for the GFORCE20 microsite and employee briefings. You then both reviewed (many, many pages!) to make sure everything was captured accurately. Thank you for making time for this, so our employees had the information needed to prepare for the event. I really appreciate it.\n\n62#Weekend Warriors|They you both so much for responding to my multiple emails on Saturday. Colleen, you’ve been extremely helpful with helping me figure out details about GFORCE20 the last week, and even responded to my inquiry over the weekend. You looped in Jen to help solve any questions I had which really showed your respect for urgency. Jen, again being the weekend and you still replied immediately to both Colleen’s question and then further concerns I had after the fact. You both have made me feel super supported and ready to celebrate GFORCE20. Thank you\n\n63#Help on the fly (pun completely intended)|Jenn - thanks so much for jumping in and sending me the necessary travel details for GFORCE for a Visa we are working to obtain for one of our employees so she can attend. We are on a super quick deadline and I am so grateful that with everything else you have going on, you took the time to respond and in such detail.Thank you for the team work and the hustle!!\n\n64#GForce 20 Wrangler|Thank you for continuing to keep us on track, on budget and on task in the ever changing world that is \"us\" and our anniversary event.  From dealing with event space booked by others (and not quite up to specs) to new agendas, new ideas and new people involved in the project you have continued to be the QA voice that is assembling facts, info and ideas to allow for creativity within the high standards we expect at an important and high profile program.  Here's to seeing the magic in Dublin!\n\n65#Show Flow|Thank you both so much for taking time ( 2 hours) out of your busy schedules before the Thanksgiving break to get down to business with the show flow of GFORCE20! We had some bumps in the road we needed to iron out and I knew with our three brains stuck in a room for 2 hours we would come up with the best way of making these minor bumps work better in the show flow. You two always work so well together when handed a task and getting it done. I believe the next couple months will be in good hands with you two as leaders in this big event we have coming up! I look forward to many more meetings planning out this fabulous event with the two of you!\n\n66#Executive Forums: The behind the scenes dream team|From emails and landing pages, to agendas and name plates, to shipping and room blocks, I could not have pulled off all of the necessary logistics and communications to host 3 executive events in 2 weeks. Your attention to detail coupled with your willingness to be flexible, allowed me to pull together a program that met the needs of attendees as well as our own executives. You helped make my job easier and the forums a success. Thank you!\n\n67#Executive Offsite Excellence|Hey Jenn and Regan, I know it was a complex program with many moving parts, and I wanted to thank you both for your amazing execution. Your dedication to delivering the best was evident, and you both worked so hard to create amazing personal and working experiences. Thank you for making my first offsite one to remember!\n\n68#Warmest Boston Welcome!|i want to thank you all for your warm welcome during mine & Aimees trip to Boston. Regan , Dana, Daisy & Manan you all took time from your very busy schedules to work with us  explaining your roles and offering your assistance when needed. You have also reached out to offer further  guidance to me since my return - this kindness doesn't go appreciated and i hope that i can offer the same support on the Dublin side in the future.  A Big Thank You Regan for organising this visit and bridging the gap across the waters & sharing your wealth of experience and ongoing support. Jen & Sara it was a pleasure to meet with you both and we are really looking forward to helping out with GFORCE20 the next big event! thank you for all your advice and information.

Thank you so much for dropping everything and getting this signed and delivered! It is very important we are at this event for many reasons and you both took it and got it across the finish line. Jenn, to many phone calls early in the morning while you are on vacation to answer all my questions and reaching out to the right people you were such a team player and helped to get this done! Julia, you worked you magic by taking a close look at all the details and got this signed by the right people and out the door before the deadline of today!! You both are true rock stars and always get things done!\n\n70#Globoforce family culture when it counts|What do you do when you have an accident away from home, you are without any identification, or wallet, and you are whisked away in an ambulance to a hospital miles from your hotel?  Who do you call when you have no phone numbers memorized, and you have no phone on you?  Somehow, jenn and Sara came to my rescue, picked up my phone in my room, zipped over to emergency to meet me and even made a CVS run for supplies. Globoforce triage at its best. Thank you both for being the rock needed to get through this ordeal. God bless you both!\n\n71#Boot Camp Leadership!|Ben and Jenn, this year's Boot Camp was a tremendous success, with awesome collaboration and factastic content. I want to thank you both for your ongoing leadership in making this event meaningful and results-oriented! Whether it's thinking through issues, dealing with logistical hurdles or discussing strategic challenges - you were always available to work the details. During the event, Ben, your leadership was always on display. Your guidance, command and direction continues to inspire everyone. As well, Jenn, nobody ever has to worry about a logistical snafu - you cover all of the bases - every time. So, thank you both for your leadership, commitment and collaboration as partners in executing this event.  We are all grateful!\n\n72#Traveling Dream Team!|What can I say... but not only am I extremely lucky but GLOBOFORCE is extremely lucky to have such a well rounded team leading events! Your game faces are always on from the moment we land on the runway to the moment we take off to head home! Mark is always the go to person for pretty much anything from set up, to IT emergencies and always being our \"top gun\" guy to get us through everything! Hannah, is always there ready to work on anything thrown at her! You really took your responsibilities and ran with them like a pro! Jennifer, our leading lady! You were the drive that got us through! You took all the behind the scenes issues and dealt with all the stuff no one even sees! The three of you together really made the week go smoothly! Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to make WorkHuman 2018 so successful! On to Nashville!\n\n73#Making sure WorkHuman works!|Jenn, you have made so many contributions to the success of WorkHuman! A few to highlight:  bringing your expertise as a great partner in planning the Executive experience that had 1000 moving parts, leading the complex challenge of staffing the entire event, making inevitable changes to the plan as needed, developing a security plan across not just the convention center but all hotels and restaurant venues, revising and enhancing that plan when Austin faced a terrible crisis ( which resolved the night you were in Austin -- coincidence???) and troubleshooting throughout the event. Your deep experience and incredible hard work-- arriving early and staying late -- helped us deliver an exceptional event. Thank you!\n\n74#Getting everyone the info they need!|Thank you all for your help putting together the WorkHuman staff training material, and for delivering the sessions. It's great when there are many people on a team all contributing to the project - it makes a big lift like this, easy! I really appreciate your attention to the details and for helping make sure employees have all they need to know before traveling to Austin. Thank you!\n\n75#Great Place to Work Gratitude|Thank you so much for everything you brought to the table last week at Great Place to Work!!! We were in a tough area for traffic but you shined the light on the Gratitude Bar once people heard about Globoforce and all the great work we were bringing to the conference! You all did a great job explaining what recognition could bring to a person and how successful it can be for all companies around the world! You were a great group to work along side with last week and I look forward to many more shows in the future on the West Coast!\n\n76#You Are Amazing!|Jen, once again you did a terrific job at the Great Places to Work event.  It always amazes me how you make something out of nothing.  I really appreciate all the work that goes in to putting these events together.  Thank you so very much for all you do.  In addition, I shake my head at how you juggle everything.  Listening to you deal with all the WorkHuman arrangements while in SF was crazy.  I kept saying to others I don't know how you do it and do it so well.  I can't tell you how very much I appreciate it!  Thank you!\n\n77#Gratitude for Gratitude Bar at GPTW|Mike and Jenn – Awesome job with finalizing the sponsorship with the Gratitude Bar at the annual Great Place to Work conference in March.  This is an incredible branding opportunity at the event where the attendees truly care about building great cultures for their people.  Our presence at the show gives attendees an opportunity to experience recognition firsthand – among a collective set of attendees who care about building the right type of workplaces.  Awesome job!\n\n78#On the road again|Back to back events, flight cancelled and what do we do? Rent a car in a snow storm and drive 9 hours to Toronto! We could have never have done that without both of you taking turns at the wheel to get us there in time to spend 5 hours to set up on the trade show floor then sit in traffic for 2 hours to return the rental. Your attitudes, dedication to Globoforce and positive attitude got us through a rough week! Thanks again for everything this week! Couldn’t have done it without you!\n\n79#HRPA Warriors|Team- Needless to say after the stories I heard from the start of this HRPA adventure, you deserve some much needed love and recognition. You braved the elements of winter after your flight was canceled, managed to set up the first ever Gratitude Bar at HRPA in record time (only 14 hours) to miss dinner, wake up and do it again, smiling the next 3 days! Thanks for being amazing team members!\n\n80#Trains, planes & automobiles... Whatever it takes!|You 3 absolutely ROCK!!!!  When faced with a flight delay and concerned with making it on time to set up for HRPA you guys took the initiative to hop in a car and make the 8 hour trek (which quickly became much more)...   It would have been easy to look the other way or try to push it onto others but you made the effort and it is TRULY appreciated as this is our biggest venue/show this year!    Not to mention you brought the Gratitude Bar to Canada EH!  And it's been an absolutely great experience.   Thanks for your help, patience and vision in making this come to life... and a BIG thank you for taking the initiative to make that painful drive!\n\n81#Leading Lady|Hard work, Commitment, and Determination is just to name a few to how to describe your work ethic! Starting from day 1 of planning of Ignite 2018 you kept everyone on track and deadlines checked off all the way up to the last few minutes of us leaving the hotel on Thursday! Your plate has been completely full on so many levels and have touched so many events for the company leading up to Ignite but you would have never have known by how you handled everything that was thrown at you. Ignite 2018 was a success because of your leading efforts to lead the core team to planning an all round perfect agenda. Many people came up to me during Ignite expressing there gratitude on how smooth everything ran and how special they felt during there stay in Boston. Thank you for being you and shining your light on the company kick off once again! You are amazing to work for and I am extremely lucky to have the best leading lady at Globoforce!\n\n82#Spotlight Jobs set up!|Thank you so much for setting up & breaking down the Spotlight Jobs table for us at Ignite! We came out to get things ready and *BOOM* all ready done! We appreciate you taking the time during a very busy event to help us out!\n\n83#Video mailer logistics|Team- Thank you so much for getting these video scheduled and room booked! These would have never happened and we would have taken a Rep out of the field at another time. It was so important to get these done while at Ignite and YOU made it happen. Thank you!!\n\n84#Igniting the Future!|Ignite Team: 2017 was a special year in our Company's history and this year's Ignite conference was simply outstanding.  I really cannot thank you all enough for the countless hours of time invested in \"Inspiring the Hearts and Minds\" of all our colleagues.  We have kickoff 2018 in grand style.  Ignite was delivered in a flawless fashion and once again, we \"topped\" last year's efforts.  Thank you all for being part of this team as each one of you contributed in so many different ways.  I look forward to meeting again this August to start to think about the daunting task of \"topping\" Ignite 2018.  Well done and Thank you all very much.\n\n85#Incredible Commitment|Jenn, Ignite 2018 is still underway but I wanted to call out your leadership in giving the team in Boston such a stellar experience that will motivate and inspire all year long. All of this, by the way, while you were not feeling well and belonged on your couch. A great effort, thank you!\n\n86#Ignite Gift for Dublin Staff|Jennifer, thank you for sourcing and ordering the Ignite gift for employees in both locations US and Dublin, which means we will have the same gift for everyone this year - fantastic! Also for arranging the shipping over to Dublin this week - greatly appreciated!  This was extra work that you kindly took on without hesitation and it has saved us a great deal of time trying to find an alternative option so thanks you so much!\n\n87#Nashville? Hell yeah!|Jenn, not everyone would jump on a plane with me 3 days before Christmas but when I asked you to come on a site visit for a second opinion, you did not hesitate. 24 hours of travel at the worst time of year but you did it with a smile. Thanks for being a great teammate.\n\n88#Exceptional Events!|Jenn, a year-end shout-out to acknowledge all you do to help us create amazing experiences for our customers, prospects and employees. I've seen you and your team in command of events ranging from the complexity of HR Tech, Ignite and important aspects of WorkHuman, to a last minute request for help with an offsite or holiday meeting. You manage them all with a smile and professionalism, and keep us on track for both deadlines and budgets. What is also true about all these events is your dedication to quality and team spirit, noticing how to help and getting ahead of possible issues. As you explore new options for us in 2018 and we take on new initiatives, I know we are in good hands with your leadership. Thank you!\n\n89#48 hours in Austin|Thank you all so much for a well planned, productive (and fun) site visit to Austin. The combination of all of your creative, logistics, content, and marketing expertise allowed us to quickly weigh the pros and cons of each venue, visualize the experience, and determine how and to who we'd message it. We have an amazing experience planned for the Executive Forum thanks to all of you!\n\n90#Marketing Closet organization|What can I say!!!! You stopped your busy schedule to save some time within two days to help organize the Marketing closet! We worked as a team to get this accomplished and you made it extremely helpful and smooth by coming up with a plan to get everything in order! You have so much on your plate but you lead us in a smooth 2 day cleaning spree and the closet has never looked so great!!!! Thanks again for all your help and leadership!\n\n91#Event toolboxes and so much more!|It's a very busy Fall events season for us and I wanted to thank you for quickly responding to a couple of logistical issues we had at our regional events. I appreciate how quickly you addressed our need for key materials making it less stressful for the Globoforce staff to set up and break down. Your commitment to logistics excellence continues to make a difference every day. Thank you!\n\n92#I Don't Know How You Do It!!|Jen, I have had to put many events and forums together in my career and it is no easy task.  Somehow you manage to put everything together so magically and effortlessly it's incredible.  HR Tech was so well put together from the booth, to the activities within the booth, to the team you put together and ran so well.  Coming from a competitor, I was more than proud to be at the Globoforce booth.  Thank you!\n\n93#Leading Lady|Jenn, congrats on the development and success of the new booth! The past couple months of hard work and dedication on your part brought the grand opening of the new booth to go perfectly and so smoothly! To the final approvals, to building the new booth at HR Tech, taking all the details in your hands and making sure th staff was ready to execute on the floor for opening night, to the final hours of breaking down and packing up the booth you were the leading lady that kept the group going all the way to the end! Thank you for always being such a great leader and making the new branded booth a success!\n\n94#Y'all ready for Austin?|Jen - I just wanted to say how much I appreciate our new partnership on many things WorkHuman. We have only just started and it has been great to have someone to collaborate with on all kinds of issues. I'm looking forward to lots of stress and lots of laughs but it will all be better together.\n\n95#Booths, booths, and more booths|We have a few booths in the queue right now and I wanted to give you a special shout out for managing all of them. When we came to redesigning our current 20x30 and 30x30, you set up the right meetings with the right people internally and externally, facilitated the conversations, and are managing the timelines. The unplanned booth being the Gratitude Bar and how we will bring that out of the road. Repurposing some of the physical structures we already own is a great idea, and I can't wait to work on it with you to bring it to life.\n\n96#Boot Camp 2017|Congrats on providing all the leadership in making Boot Camp 2017 another successful event! You had everyone on track from day 1 all the way up to the last day of events at Boot Camp! We had such a wide range of hands putting together the agenda and events and you kept everyone on track. You handled all the hotel arrangements for all 92 attendees and made sure everything went extremely smoothly. You are always on top of flights, site visits, AV needs for each meeting space and supported Hannah and I in shuttle car services for out of state attendees and night time events! I look forward to planning next years Boot Camp with you next year!\n\n97#Leader to all...|Jenn, thank you so much for all of your hard work. No matter the event, no matter the circumstance, you are a consummate professional and handle every challenge with poise and professionalism. It’s a pleasure working with you and I look forward to working with you for years to come. Keep up the good work!!\n\n98#Another flawless logistical Bootcamp!|Jenn, Sarah and Hannah, I'd like to sincerely thank you for your incredible organizational skills that helped make Bootcamp 2017 Newport  a tremendous success. During the past few months it has been a pleasure to work with you. No matter what obstacles presented themselves, you were always ahead of the curve - and organizing a mid-summer event in Newport is not easy! Knowing you were planning the meeting meant we could focus on the content.  Often, the effort you put in can be overlooked because so many things happen behind the scenes that are expected to just \"happen\". I want you to know that a day doesn't go by where I don't appreciate the contributions you make and the value you deliver! Thanks again --- and Ignite 2018 here we come!!\n\n99#WorkHuman - Fantastic Collaboration!|I wanted to thank all of you for your excellent ideas, transparency, and new approaches for WorkHuman.  As we get closer to finalizing the strategy for WorkHuman 2018, your collective efforts have helped bring our plan to a new level.  Thank you for your fantastic collaboration.  WorkHuman 2018 is going to be an awesome success - because we're starting it off right and building all the elements from the ground (and crowd!) up.\n\n100#Timely Teamwork|Thanks so much for providing stats and documentation that I requested in such a timely manner to help one of our international prospects build the business case to attend WH 2018. When I shared the request, you immediately knew exactly what I was looking for and turned around this information around so quickly. Thanks for making my job easier and for being so responsive. Much appreciated!\n\n101#It's all in the details...|Thank you for adding everything we spoke about into Workfront for the Small asset reskin for shows project request you had today.

Thanks again for taking the time to help your teammates and follow the new process. I hope you have great success at your shows!!\n\n102#Around the Clock Workhuman Dream Team|Starting at 3am Friday morning, you guys all put on your superhero hats! You worked around the clock to be 10 steps ahead of everyone! It didn't matter if it was answering emails that came in every 2 mins about shuttles and car service, to emails about AV and internet needs for every employee at the conference and making sure demos and theatre were set up and broken down! Everyone always reached out to Jenn for endless questions about logistics, staffing, agenda, scheduling, and looking for the leadership from someone who has the experience in running a kick ass show! You three stood out from the conference as hard workers that never slept, barely had time to eat, always making sure everything was on time, everyone's needs were met, people were where they needed to be, and always did it with a smile and made things look so smooth and with perfection! I am proud to be apart of such an amazing team! On to Austin!\n\n103#Keeping everyone in line!!|Congrats on the terrific work on all of the staffing for WorkHuman!  I knew I never had to wonder or worry about anything getting done.  You had the entire project in control and on track from the moment you started.  And whenever I came to you with questions or concerns, you had a quick and simple solution.  A huge thanks as well for stepping in on-site and managing all of the last minute requests and work items that came your way.  You managed all with ease and a great attitude.  I really appreciate your expertise and understanding of the on-site experience - and I know you help improve it for all of our attendees.  Thank you and I look forward to 2018! Congratulations!\n\n104#This, that, the other and a whole lot more!|Thank you Jenn, for being so on top of all the requests I toss your way.  I know that once I ask for something, it will be done promptly and (usually) with a smile.  :-) In the crazy last few weeks, it is lovely not to worry about these tasks getting done.  I know without a doubt you have them and are running.  And I know everything you do helps ensure there will be an excellent attendee experience at WorkHuman! Thank you!\n\n105#Masters of the Master Schedule!|Long weeks,  days, and many many overtime hours have gone into this hard work and dedication to the master schedule for WorkHuman! Hannah you stepped right into trying to tackle this beast on your first day back and we are now a week and half away from WorkHuman and your shining through with all your hard work on this project!

We are extremely lucky to have you on board and in the booth if we are having issues with connection or something does wrong with the demo! The sales reps expressed there gratitude and were lucky to have you two steps away if something wasn't right when they were demoing the site to prospects! Jenn, your dedication and leadership always shines through from the moment we are on site to the end when we wrap up after a couple long days! Your always on top of keeping everyone in line and all the details come together to make sure Globoforce is the best booth on the floor!!! I had a blast with both of you on and off the tradeshow floor! Bring on WorkHuman!\n\n107#Totally Rewards Rockstars|A quick note to thank you all for the amazing work you three did to make the Globoforce experience at this week's Total Rewards Conference such a great success!  From getting the amazing location that was impossible for attendees to avoid, to ensuring consistently full candy towers, and ensuring all demo systems were running flawlessly, you all did amazing work to ensure that the sales team could be successful.

You are our true ring leader on the events team and I am so very lucky to have an amazing leader that has taught me so much!

Your determination ran through out the whole process leading up to the final hours of the event. Everyone said it was the best Ignite yet! Great Way to kick off the year and I cant wait to have an amazing year full of successful tradeshows and events lead by the best manager a girl could ask for!!!\n\n112#Ignite Customer Panel|Thank you Jen for your help with the Customer panel.

Thanks for all that you do!\n\n114#Marketing Hackathon Success|Thank you for making the first-ever Marketing Hackathon such a success! You embodied all our core values and the results were fantastic. The two-week Marketing sprint made us more agile as a team, brought out new ideas empowering every member of the team, and we found new approaches to market – ideas that could impact both our marketing approach and our go-to market for opportunities ahead. There was a buzz and vibe around the office that was felt by all your enthusiasm and accomplishment - all the way up the executive chain. Simply put, YOU ROCKED IT! Jess, Jill, and Kevin\n\n115#Maximizing Efforts|Jen- Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to brainstorm and maximize our marketing efforts for HRPA. Due to the spam laws, you need to get creative. You are always open to new ideas, listening and taking it all in...answering with \"Ill have to review my budget\". Wait until you get back from vacation to see the requests rolling in:) Thank you again, I can always count on you!\n\n116#There's fast and there's super fast|Jen, thanks so much for getting back to me so promptly this afternoon. Once again, you were on the ball and super obliging. Really appreciated your time. Cheers. Deirdre\n\n117#Masters of Perfection|Jenn and Sara,   I have a deep respect for how well you orchestrate our events and tradeshows. You are the first ones to arrive on the show floor and the last ones to leave--making sure that everything is perfect to a tee! Not only that, you also take care of our individual needs whether it's accommodating change in travel plans or making dinner reservations! Thank you for all you do!\n\n118#Timely Service with a Smile|Jenn, I always appreciate your attention to my receipt requests. I know that there were a lot of them and you were busy doing last minute preparations for HR Tech Europe. But, you worked diligently this week to close last week's HR Tech show so that you could be sure to submit them in a timely manner. Thanks for staying organized, timely, and for your teamwork!\n\n119#Tradeshow Queen|Jenn, What can I say, you did it again. All the planning, no sleep, crazy weeks leading up to HR Tech Chicago paid off. You make the week look easy on your part. Everything was in place and everyone walked out of the tradeshow floor happy! You are always a step ahead making sure everything is in order for the show and everything falls right into place! If there was any issues, you are the first in line to get everything taken care of! You are a true leader and everyone depends on you in all departments. We are very lucky to have you as our side as our leader here at Globoforce! Thanks for making this trip one we will never forget! Chicago down, Paris here we come!\n\n120#Tradeshow Dream Team!|Jenn, Mark, and Sara - Another successful HR Tech is in the books due to your outstanding efforts! THANK YOU for all of the hard work you do before the show, and behind the scenes, to ensure that our events run flawlessly. Jenn, your persistent leadership to get everything done on time and at a high level of quality is remarkable. Mark, your technical expertise and dedication to these shows makes a huge difference to the experience at our booth. Sara, thank you for your positive energy, can-do attitude, and superior organization to make sure we shine throughout the entire event. I know that while the rest of the team \"just shows up\", the three of you spend countless hours away from your families traveling, setting up and breaking down, dealing with unions, electricians, waiting for crates, leading to skipped meals, very few breaks, and many late night dinners. You are definitely the dream team and it's inspiring to watch the three of you in action together, making it happen! On to Paris!\n\n121#Logistics Power|What can I say.  You are awesome!  You are always there to help me when I am in a pinch.  You understand the complexity of putting on events large or small.  You get all of the behind the scenes mini dramas and rhythms.  It is  great to have a teammate that I can come to for help, laughter or oversight to ensure everything will and does go smoothly.  I have truly enjoyed building our relationship! Thank you :)\n\n122#Flawless Execution|Thank you for executing event logistics on such short timelines!  On top of all of the other daily tasks you have, you made time to help with the ADP partner event with only a few days turnaround time and have been a major resource for Rewards Northwest.  Thank you for the teamwork!\n\n123#Event Aficionado!|Jen, thank you for taking the time to share your event-planning expertise, even for something as simple as how many meals/what meals to order for a meeting. Not only did you give suggestions/advice, but you followed up with me to see how everything panned out. Definitely representative of a strong, thoughtful team member! Thank you :)\n\n124#Great goody bags!|Jenn - When I found out that Eli Lilly would be coming into the office this week and we needed to quickly get them some nice give a ways, I was a bit stumped.  But as usual, you immediately came to the rescue.  Within minutes you pulled together a bevvy of fun and useful GF branded items that will help make our customers feel welcome and special.  Thank you so much!\n\n125#Stevens to the rescue|Jen, I came to you with a minor issue (which felt major at the time) last week at bootcamp. You're always on top of things and so dedicated to keeping everyone on the team happy on a trip which you've coordinated. You took care of the problem extremely fast and it's nice to know I have someone to help during travel. I also really enjoyed seeing you Tuesday morning when I let you know it felt just like summer camp, and you agreed! Also, thanks for being so accommodating all the time for my \"diet\" restrictions.\n\n126#Boot Camp Behind the Scenes Phenoms|Jenn & Hannah- the superstars to support us all! Thank you for your dedication to ensure Boot Camp was a huge success. Thank you personally for helping me with all the logistics behind the scenes - from recipe cards, to flip charts, to meals & activities, to keeping the room cool - you two are the best! & Hannah you are truly learning from a PRO! Thank you both immensely for everything you did leading up to this week & during this week. You rock!\n\n127#Quick feet!|Jenn,   I wanted to thank you for helping us enroll our new hire into boot camp not even a week before it started! I so appreciate your willingness to jump in, book her hotel, add her to the schedule, and make sure we were good-to-go even though we were last minute! It was fantastic timing being able to add a new sales hire to the sessions - and I appreciate your \"quick feet\" getting her set for  boot camp!\n\n128#Action and Team Oriented!|Jenn, I want to thank you for always stopping what you do when I have a question, want to collaborate, or need information for the budget from you. I know you have many moving parts running Shows, Sales Boot Camp, and Logistics for the WH forums, but you are always able to stop and provide me with whatever I request so that I can be sure to get the information that I need. Thank you for your attention to my requests and I appreciate the partnership.\n\n129#Never underestimate the importance of coffee!|Jen - When we found out Dunkin' Donuts would be speaking at the WorkHuman Regional Forum in Boston, naturally we wanted to make sure we could feature their coffee at the event.  You immediately contacted the hotel and ensured that we could bring in Dunkin Donuts coffee and donuts during the break.  Thanks to you, the attendees will be able to enjoy Dunkin's delicious coffee while hearing their amazing story!  Thank you so much for your help!\n\n130#Event Management Leadership|Thank you to my amazing team for taking ownership of the many different aspects of the WorkHuman Regional Forums. You are all doing a spectacular job managing your pieces to a tight deadline and budget, while also keeping everyone up to speed and on schedule. This project has so many moving parts, spanning many cities, multiple teams, outside speakers, customers, vendors, hotels, and partners; and I know it's going to be huge success due to your dedication and effort. Great work Jen on promotion/sales comms, Jenn on logistics, Jill on creative, and Krista on content!\n\n131#Boot Camp is coming!|Jenn, Megan and Bill,  As the dates for Boot Camp draw near, I wanted to say a big thank you for everything that you've done so far to make this event great. With scores of logistical issues to deal with, agendas to construct, moderators to organize, dry runs to execute, materials to produce and the many other items that crop up - you guys have been an incredible team. We're all very excited about the event and I know the entire sales team will benefit tremendously. You are heroes and we are grateful! Thanks!!\n\n132#Excellence in Event Management|Hi Jenn, I have worked with you for many years, and it wasn't until SHRM, did I fully understand the level of detail you put into each and every event we have at Globoforce. Seeing your excellence in action was truly amazing. From you skills at negotiating with even the most stubborn vendors, to hauling literally tons of candy, to ensuring documentation before and after every event is completely meticulously, your expertise, diligence and respect for quality is amazing. Your bike riding skills and high knees running to escape rats are also a sight to be seen! :) Thank for allowing me to support you at the show and see the level of work and quality you dedicate to each and every event. Anne Marie\n\n133#More candy= more leads|Jen and Mark, thank you both for all the work you did in organizing and managing the SHRM booth. I'm particularly impressed at the amount of trips you both needed to make to buy more candy. We achieved the highest ever number of scanned names at any show - 5000+ versus around 2500 last year. That means double the amount people at our booth but double the amount of candy needed!! To keep our costs down you hire a car and drive to the nearest wholesale market to get cheaper candy - I can't imagine how many boxes you carried or packets you opened but we are all extremely grateful. I'm sure you don't want to see any candy for a while!\n\n134#Power Team|Thank you for all your help and teamwork getting all the logistics together for workhuman.  I have truly enjoyed building a strong relationship.  Together we could take over the world of logistics !\n\n135#WorkHuman Success!|Well done Humans! What an incredible success our WorkHuman event was this year! It is the pinnacle event of our year. It’s the culmination of all the work we do throughout the year on delivering thought leadership to our community.    I know you have all worked tirelessly for months to deliver an event that amazes, delights and inspires. The execution of every part of the event was fantastic. From the agenda and speakers to the amazing graphics and hotel set up. I appreciate the co-ordination it takes to pull all of this off and I thank all of you for your contribution.   Only a team this talented and united could execute such a big task so flawlessly.   The feedback at the event and after has been overwhelming. It was an unbridled success. It had impact far beyond our typical business objectives in that it moved hearts and minds - in a way that was inspirational. Just one quote from one of the many amazing pieces of feedback - “Exposure to the goodness of your company and the passion for humanity within this conference provided the force of 1 million flowers at a critical time in my life”. Wow.  You are WorkHuman.   Congratulations and Thank you!\n\n136#Announcing WorkHuman 2017|Jen - it's amazing to think that you planned 6 hotels visits in 3 different states, travelled with me to those site visits, negotiated contracts and will have our WorkHuman 2017 location ready to announce all in the space of 2 weeks. I can't thank you enough for jumping on this, trekking around with me and pushing to get everything we want in the contract. I'm so excited to be announcing this at WH2016 and even more excited about the 2017 event. Awesome work!\n\n137#Way to workhuman|Jenn, I just wanted to call out all the hard work you are in the middle of with this tremendous workhuman planning. Your organizational skills are sick! I can only imagine what it takes to create and keep track of travel for 100+ globostars.

You and your husband went out of your way to spend such quality time with me and I so appreciate it!  Because of that, I got to see all of the detail and planning that you undertake to ensure that an event such as this is pulled off without a hitch.  You are a superstar!  Thank you!\n\n140#Master of Organization|Jenn- You have amazed me with the incredible amount of organization and attention to detail you've brought to the WorkHuman team. Thank you so much for jumping in, quickly figuring out all of the high priority issues, and getting us moving in the right direction.

Your expertise, time and talents are so appreciated and I am very grateful for all you've taken on. You rock!\n\n143#Event Excellence|Jenn, You did a fantastic job presenting our national trade show past, present, and future to the team this week. Your slides were so informative and painted a clear picture of our successes in terms of driving ROI. As we kick off our 2016 booth redesign we all have clear insight into what's worked, what hasn't and how to optimize to maximize results from these events. Thank you for your efforts in pulling together the data and presenting it so thoroughly!\n\n144#Ignite Leader of the Pack|Where do I begin, from the moment you kicked off our first meeting back in October to Friday morning when we packed up the remaining items from Ignite 2016 you have been a true leader in so many areas. Starting with the meetings once a week to keep everyone in line and people on track, to your endless meetings with the Team from Marriot to make sure everything at the Hotel was in line and every detail was picture perfect. Also, would could forget the amount of hours and patience going over spreadsheets of data to make sure every attendee has exactly what they needed. Working closely with the creative and Executive team on their Keynote speeches and  making the final touches on the magic that the creative team put together for all the breakout sessions. You were truly everyones leadering lady! It was a true pleasure working along side of you during my first time on the project. You made Ignite 2016 the best yet and I look forward to working with you next year on Ignite 2017!\n\n145#Herding cats|Jenn and Sara, in addition to the 1000 item checklist for Ignite, there is the added checklist for visiting clients and our special extended \"friend of the family\". Thank you for organizing wonderful thank you gifts, for specially preparing a client agenda, and for coordinating travel for those that needed it. We had another successful event and I couldn't host these VIPs without your teamwork. Thanks for everything!\n\n146#Getting us everything we need at every corner!|Jenn and Sara thank you both so much for getting me everything I needed during Ignite. You're both so well prepared at every corner! Whether it's something small like needing a Tylenol or trying to find someone or something big like getting us setup with a proper space and internet connection so that we can actually complete our work you always have the answer! I couldn't even count the number of times I asked you for something of the course of Ignite. Thank you both for doing what you do! Thanks for making sure we were able to eat when we couldn't make it to the meal! These events are a lot of work but a lot fun as well, I look forward to working with both of you at future events! Thanks Jenn and Sara!\n\n147#Ignite Awesomeness!|Jenn, Thank you so much for everything you do! Not just with Ignite but in all our events.

You are a master of your craft!!\n\n148#SHRM Foundation Event Sponsorship|Thank you all so much for all you did to prepare for the SHRM foundation event in DC this week! Our sponsorship of the Headshot Lounge not only looks fantastic because of the creative ideas you brought to the table, but created a great environment for quality conversations with powerhouse SHRM leaders around the country. We're having great conversations with influential HR leaders that will drive interest in WorkHuman, lead to regional speaking opportunities for the field, and deliver qualified leads to Globoforce. I'm grateful to work with such a skilled and dedicated team!\n\n149#Prepared and Thorough, always!|Thanks so much for your organizational help at both HR Techs and especially for loaning me your presentation clicker for my demo at HR Tech World.

Thanks for being so prepared and thorough!\n\n150#Event management superstar|Hi Jen, once again you have amazed me with your ability to manage both hr tech Vegas and he tech Paris on back to back weeks.

From the booth setup and tech operations, helping on the demo stations, finagling with the powerpoints, training on scanning, and everything in between. It was a long week, but the three of you put your best foot forward and got the job done. Great teamwork!\n\n153#Euro Stars|Jenn/Sara - Wanted to say a BIG THANKS for all of your hard work and organizing for HR Tech Europe - I know you must have been quite tired and a bit home-sick, especially with it being so soon after the one in Vegas, plus Sara I know you were missing your kid big-time. Thanks again, I'm sure everyone who attended will agree you both did a fantastic job.\n\n154#Thanks for your help!|Jen thank you for stepping in and sorting out the problem with our hotel booking in Paris on the Monday night.

Additionally your help with getting a secure room for us to work in was much appreciated and packing materials and boxes, internet, everything else was absolutely necessary to the success of our mission this week. Thanks again!\n\n163#Amazing Events in 2015!|Jenn, I wanted to take a moment and recognize all of the outstanding work you've done on our major events this year. While the entire marketing team was fully engrossed in WorkHuman 2015, you have led the charge to make sure we hit a home run on every single event - Ignite, Sales Leadership Club, Total Rewards, SHRM, ADP Meeting of the Minds, and HRPA in Canada. You think through every detail on pre-event marketing campaigns, our onsite presence, and the marketing follow-up, and mobilize the team to execute perfectly. On the logistics side, you have shown once again that no one does it better than you! I'm not sure people appreciate the level of detail that goes into each of these events and all the activity happening behind the scenes - finding the right locations, selecting menus, managing booth staff, audio/visual, just to name a few. We are so fortunate to be able to just show up at our event - whether internal or external - and know that Jenn Stevens has taken care of everything. While doing this, you also took on the new role of mentor for Sara Welch, and have done an absolutely fantastic job showing her the ropes!  Great, great work Jenn!\n\n164#Genius!!!|Jenn, this was the first time I had the opportunity to watch you in action and the way you manage an event and this was a huge one - SHRM!    The booth was amazing.   The candy idea was genius!  There is no doubt that we had more visitors than any other booth at the show.   I have tremendous respect for what you do and know that there is so much hard work and stress involved.  You deserve to be celebrated!  Fantastic job!!!!   Jen\n\n165#Registration desk magic|Jenn,   Thank you for managing the registration desk at WorkHuman with such patience and ease. You are a true pro at these things and you made sure that desk with cooking with gas (and smiles). Love working with you. And for you.  Kerry\n\n166#Herculean Effort|Just when we thought WorkHuman ended, it showed up at our door in the form of a 10' long, 300 lb crate. And even though this is not part of anyone's everyday job, you all worked with me in moving this beast of a delivery, coordinating and strategizing a new home for it and doing it all with a smile on your face. I am so lucky to be working with such a great group of people that rally together to get a job done, you guys are the best!!!\n\n167#Amazing Teamwork!|To my amazing team... Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you've done to make WorkHuman a huge success! Jill and Sarah, you joined us in the midst of the WorkHuman madness and yet jumped right in to help in so many ways. Jenn, your leadership on registration was outstanding and created the best first impression for our attendees. Sara, your willingness to take on anything with a huge smile made such a difference and the team looks to you as our go-to person. Veronica, your running of operation swag bag among a thousand other things you did behind the scenes to make sure we were ready to go. And Mariana, I am so proud of your work on all of the marketing campaigns you did to bring the humans to WorkHuman! I am so grateful to work with such an amazing, intelligent, hard working group of women!\n\n168#Thank you for being WorkHuman|Jenn, you were amazing this week when I found myself with a somewhat serious injury this week. We were in the middle of setting up and so much was going on. Without hesitation you offered to take me to the emergency in Orlando and you stayed with me for the few hours needed. Thank you for being such a caring co-worker and for living the values of WorkHuman.\n\n169#Dream Team|If I could wrap all 5 Awards into one recognition I would, but since I cant I choose teamwork. We began this WorkHuman journey together 6 months ago and the results of everyone's hard work, perseverance, dedication, passion and commitment was evident leading up to the conference and definitely throughout the conference. The conference was the most visually appealing I have ever been to. Our content and program was powerful and motivational, our social media outreach was phenomenal, Workhuman central was interactive and provided great networking opportunities. The onsite teamwork shown by the blue team, registration team and all of our greeters was very personal and friendly. I couldn't have been more proud to have such a great group of humans to take this journey with. Thank you to all for making this truly a dream team for me.\n\n170#Marketing Magic at Workhuman|The conference speaks for itself.  Well done!\n\n171#A tremendous welcome in the middle of a tornado|I truly appreciate you finding time in the middle of all the WH and other crazy deadlines to help get me up to speed on how you help make Globoforce awesome. I feel 100% part of this team, even after only three short weeks, and so much more prepared to help hold down the fort next week.\n\n172#Role Model|Jen- Thank you so very much for taking me under your wing and showing me the ropes!

Jen\n\n176#It takes a village...|Pam, Andrea and I would like to thank all of you for your help and hard work in making our Recognition Roundtable in Phoenix a success.

As I said at the beginning of my first presentation, I believe this year’s meeting has been the best organized and planned event in my 8 years of hosting our team.  I commend each one of you for the professionalism you brought to every meeting, discussion, and decision on what would make Ignite 2015 both informational and inspirational. My sincerest thanks for your dedication and determination to keep everything on track during the planning process. A challenge I put out to all of us after last years Ignite was to make the planning as fun as the event.  From my perspective, you achieved that objective by getting ahead of the calendar, recruiting a great team to build the event, and each of you bringing leadership to your area of responsibility. From my heart, thank you all.\n\n180#Clearing up at month end|I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for your diligence and quick turn around at the end of each month when it comes to closing the monthly budget.

Thank you for all the support!\n\n181#NY Customer Event Success|Pam and Jenn, thanks so much for all of your help in the planning and execution of the inaugural NY area customer network event. Your support with the location, invitations, planning, logistics, and gifts was much appreciated.

We now have a strong foundation for ongoing NY area customer events in the coming year. Thanks!\n\n182#It takes a village....|It takes a village to conceive, design, promote, execute and showcase a mammoth undertaking like our Service Timelines experiential booth presence at HR Tech in Vegas.  But thanks to the extraordinary dedication, talent and collaboration of EVERYONE on this award list, we successfully delivered on our goal: We engaged prospects, influencers, analysts and press on the depth and breadth of our Service Timelines offering at HR Tech.  A HUGE thank you to each and every one of you for your unique, valued contribution to this success.\n\n183#Outstanding 2014 Bootcamp|I know this is long overdue but I wanted to recognize you for running the logistics on our best Bootcamp Meeting in my 8 years at Globoforce.  It’s great when a plan comes together; the fact that you were able to get the President of the United States to literally crash our party will give our team members a memory of a lifetime.   Thank you for all you do behind the scenes to make these meetings an outstanding success.\n\n184#Engage 2015 Information|Thank you for your quick response when I was looking for information on the next Engage conference.  Unum came to me with an urgent request for numbers they could use for their budget.  Their numbers were due at the end of the day and in order to ensure their attendance at the next conference, they needed to put together a rough estimate of what their expenses may be.    Your ability to respond quickly will help ensure that the Program Manager from Unum is able to attend the conference.  Unum came away from the 2014 conference with a plan to adopt many of the new features released this year.  Now that they have a budget for the 2015 conference, they will be able to do the same next year!\n\n185#SHRM - Core Team!|Thank you guys for all your hard work at SHRM. You made it an enjoyable experience and the show was a huge success. It's not always easy to deal with those long days in that type of heat, but you both kept a smile on and powered through! Well Done!\n\n186#What happens behind the scene!|From getting a hug from a complete stranger, to not being allowed to get hurt, because we only had one band aid left. High temperatures, dehydration, no air conditioner, lack of sleep ( it may sound like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not). Let me also mention all of the lifting, running, cleaning, all to make sure that SHRM would be a success. Thanks Jenn and Mark for being so attentive to every single detail, even though it was exhausting (and we know it) SHRM was a success.   (Oh and thanks for always waiting for me!!!)   -V\n\n187#W@W|Hi Jenn!! I wanted to Thank you once again for letting me be part of the W@W team in Dallas. I had a great time and working with you is always an experience. You are always so patient with me and I couldn't appreciate it more. Thank you for always being so supportive!\n\n188#Sweet Innovation|World @ Work Team. Excellent innovation in putting together the “candy store” experience. We tried something new and it paid off! Re-skinning our existing booth wasn't expensive and the new experience was a huge hit. People were 2-3 deep to come get their candy and hear about how Globoforce can drive results. People told us “it was the best of the show!” We drove tons of leads, so much so that we needed a new scanner. Jen Dold, this was your idea – nice leadership. Darcy & Jess, thanks for making it come together on brand and on message. Great job on the show organizing, Jen & Veronica. Kevin & Mike, great job on the communications & social media. I’m really proud of this innovation. Julie, great leadership on making it all come together. Awesome job gang!\n\n189#The candy booth is a hit!|Team- I knew the candy booth would be good, but who knew it would be the most popular booth at the conference! People love the concept and how our employee recognition programs make them feel like a kid in a candy store. Tremendous work!\n\n190#Fantastic Sales Leadership Club Event!|Well, Jen. You did it again. The facilities, organization, location, logistics, everything went off without a hitch. A fantastically organized event and everyone is thrilled. Thank you again!\n\n191#Great craic in Mayo!|Jenn -   Once again you pulled off an amazing event (in another country nonetheless!)  Your attention to the details, the time and planning you put in was evident.  A great time was had by all and the weather couldn't have been better (I know you probably planned that, too!)  Thank you for all of your efforts.   I know I wouldn't have been able to handle this event on my own.  (But you DID sneak out before the back handspring on the sprawling green lawn ...)\n\n192#The extra TLC!|When you heard Jennifer Reimert from Symantec was sick during Engage, you went the extra mile to repeatedly send to her room a few items to help her feel better and recover. It's this little extra touch that meant a lot to Jen and she even gave a call out on Facebook...\"If you are ever going to get sick while on business travel, I recommend the good partners at Globoforce.\" This extra TLC and thoughtfulness is why our clients love us!\n\n193#Engage 2014 Rocked!|Jenn, words can't express how thrilled we are with Engage 2014.  What you do is truly magical and I know it is not nearly as easy as you make it look.  The feedback from the clients and prospects has been amazing thus far and we moved the business forward this week.  You were a big part of that.  I hope you enjoy the little tribute because it is well deserved.  Thank you!!\n\n194#Engage 2014 Success|Pam/Jess/Jen - thanks for an amazing team effort on Engage. We doubled in size but still had a intimate, meaningful and entertaining event for all. It's amazing to see all you hard work come together! Awesome job!\n\n195#Fantastic Customer Service|I'm certain this is only the tip of the iceberg, Jenn, but I had to recognize you after Susan from Bechtel called you out on a recent call for being \"incredible, patient and helpful\" as she made her (apparently complicated) reservations for Engage. She remarked that she'd had first hand experience with that sort of cat-herding and she was so impressed with your good-natured help and your ability to accommodate her team. Great work on that!\n\n196#Great job on HRD Birmingham show!|Well done Jenn and thanks a mill for your work on the HRD show last week. Your preparation and management of the show organisers paid off in some great meetings for James and I. Much appreciated!\n\n197#Oh Canada!|Jenn, Kerry and Mike, what a great job you did last week as we took a huge step into the Canadian market with HRPA.  We didn't just show up.  First, Jenn, you secured the absolute BEST booth location possible right in the front of the Exhibit Hall and it looked fantastic.  Kerry and Mike you did a superb job hunting down journalists and influencers in that market to get the Globoforce message out and time it with the latest issue of Canadian HR Reporter which Thomson Reuters was giving out to everyone.  Nice job eh!\n\n198#Tipping Tradeshow TV Troubles Trumph|Only the eagle eye of quality could notice HRPA's first leaning tower of Pisa.  Unnoticeable  to the naked eye (well, actually, the door didn't work, the pieces were coming apart, and the TV was askew, but still!), you put the crack team of electricians and engineers (well, ok, maybe not engineers), to disassemble and reassemble our presentation platform.  Now, complete with \"L' brackets, sand bags and I-beams, we were all resting comfortably, feeling safe and protected during our presentations.  Jenn, you were able to fix the tower of terror in record time, by Toronto worker standards, during one of the short lulls in the show.   If we had a safety award, you'd get it!  Thanks!\n\n199#True respect|Jenn, in addition to managing everything that comes during an event such as Ignite (attendees, logistics, schedules, agenda, the list goes on and on) you truly care about the people you work with and that was evident last week. Thank you for coming to my rescue the minute you found out I was sick. You stopped everything during one of the busiest times at Ignite to make sure I was ok and had medication. This is not the first time you have gone out of your way to help me with something urgent and I wanted to say I really appreciate it. It truly made my day and a world of difference. Thank you!\n\n200#Ignite Champs!|I can't imagine all the details and requests that had to be attended to for Ignite but you handled it like a champ! It seemed like every time I turned around you were there getting ready, setting something up, getting things for people, answering questions, basically anything but sitting still! Thanks for all your hard work! The event was a blast!\n\n201#IGNITE|Thank you so much for coordinating everything for Ignite. You are such a team player and helped the design team tremendously gathering specs, coordinating schedules for onsite visits, keeping everything in line for the event. The reason it is such a success is because of your attention to detail and determination! Thanks for all that you do! ☺\n\n202#Great award title|Jen, yet another fantastic awesome spectacular kickoff event for the entire team. Because of you are event was flawless and everyone had a fantastic experience yet again. It's unbelievable. Great job. Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye\n\n203#Travel-frenzy!|Thank you so much for booking our travel arrangements to our last trip to Arizona, upcoming site visits to Boston, etc. During this super busy time of year where we all need to be somewhere fast, your help with arranging schedules and agendas is super appreciated!\n\n204#Awe inspiring determination|Wow! Like you, I've planned and executed large events. I understand the stress not only leading up to the event but also the unexpected issues that arise during set up. That being said, I was in awe of your determination on the show floor during setup. You managed the team, gave direction and handled potentially show devastating issues with perseverance and a cool headed attitude.\n\n205#HR Tech|Jenn,    It's hard to overstate how much stress and complexity there is in having a great presence at a show like HR Tech. Your persistence, communication skills and ability get things done were all on display before, during (and even after) HR Tech. Great job.\n\n206#Vegas|Jenn, I apologize for not being able to help in Vegas.  I know you put a lot of thought into planning and scheduling.  With me unable to attend at the last minute, I know you picked up a lot of my responsibilities.  Thank you!  Art\n\n207#HR Tech Planning|JenniferStevens - great job getting the team prepped for HR Tech. This is a big endeavor. And your leadership is critical to getting everyone on message, well dressed ;) and ready for the big event. Great work!\n\n208#Teamwork is an Understatement|WOW! I can't say enough I work with an outstanding team! I am surrounded by innovative, creative, and hardworking teammates which rings true in the new booth redesign. From creating brilliant initial concepts and research, daily meetings and an amazing outline/messaging doc, the new design brings our brand to the next level! This booth has been all hands on deck and will be such a success against our competition! Great work!!\n\n209#Awesome boot camp|You did an amazing job with the Chicago boot camp!!  We all loved the venue, food and activity!  You are such a hard worker and we all appreciate you.\n\n210#Grace under fire|Thank you for going out of your way to get us all a sound night's sleep and on the first flight out of Chicago after our flight home was cancelled. You saved all of a ton of aggregation.\n\n211#Tradeshow Go to Girl!|Fantastic work planning and executing SHRM! Your hard work and dedication to making each event a success is truly remarkable! From the initial visits designing the booth, shipping schedules, and SO much more you are such an asset to the team and your sense of humor makes it all the better! :) GREAT WORK!\n\n212#So often small things make a BIG difference|Your critical help to make sure the BHI pursuit continues to run smoothly is very appreciated.

You are a fantastic and valued teammate!\n\n213#Travelling to All the Events!|I travel to just a few of the events you arrange during the year Jennifer, and what we all forget sometimes is that you have to travel to ALL the events!   All of them are your responsibility to plan, execute and travel for.   You always manage my participation flawlessly, I feel well informed and on site everything I need comes together.  Thank you for your great organizational skills, but especially thank you for your commitment and determination in traveling the world and being in attendance at all the events!\n\n214#Outstanding Sales Leadership Club Event|I cannot begin to express my thanks for your efforts in making Globoforce’s inaugural Sales Leadership Club a truly outstanding event.  First off, your guidance and planning enabled our team to celebrate the success of 2012 in style at the beautiful Hotel Del in San Diego.  The event agenda struck an amazing balance between structured time and free time which allowed each participant to get to know their Globoforce colleagues and still have time to explore on their own.  Our weekend was capped off with a perfect evening on the Sun Deck at the Del where we all watched the sun set over the Pacific Ocean and enjoyed a delicious meal together.  The Navy Seals added to our experience by parachuting onto Coronado beach and much story telling was shared around the tables and fire pits as the evening wound down.  As this was our first Sales Leadership Club, I sincerely appreciate everything you did to make this a very special occasion.  On behalf of our team and for your expertise in delivering world class events, thank you.\n\n215#Sales leadership club Succes|What a fantastic trip. You did an incredible job!\n\n216#Last minute switches...are no match!|After our client (Quintiles) had to make a last minute speaker change to the HCI annual conference, you quickly covered all the bases.  From changing travel arrangements to working with show organizers, you ensured the change would be seamless. It was a fantastic display of delivering what was needed asap!\n\n217#Engage Client Video Shoot|Your support on the logistics for the client video shoot was instrumental in making it such a huge success! From pre-event planning for audio/visual to onsite help with crew, I could count on your help and quick, thorough response every step of the way!\n\n218#The woman behind the curtain|Jenn,    Engage was another amazing event. There is so much behind-the-scenes work and stress involved in pulling those events off, and you do an amazing job!\n\n219#SWAGful!|Thank you for all of your help preparing the SWAG for Engage! You showed  patience when working with our vendors and helping me push to meet all of our in-hand delivery deadlines. You helped me out tremendously with the assembly line of packaging the SWAG and mailing everything out in time for the conference.\n\n220#Hustling to be the best|Jenn,  You really went out of your way to accommodate my clients for the Engage conference.  Coordinating with all parties is part of the job, of course, but you accomplish this with such regularity.  I'm pleased to work with a winner like you, who figures out a way to accommodate unusual requests on a usual basis.  Thank you for Cadence, Premier Farnell and all the rest of the clients you've been accommodating.  Rog\n\n221#Giving a home to our new mothers!|Jen,    Thank you so much for offering up your Marketing closet and moving it down the hall so our new mom's have a private locked place to go. I know it was a lot of work moving all those boxes and took a good amount of your time. You did it without even thinking twice!    Thanks again for being so flexable!\n\n222#Ignite - Now a very high bar!|Jen, your leadership = the success that Ignite 2013 was. This event I believe will be one of the \"game changers\" that I believe we will look back on years to come. The event was truly flawlessly executed. Our sales, marketing, consulting and executives left the event charged up and ready to succeed! Jess/Kara/Kelli - there are just so many large and small details that made the event truly shine - everything from the video, to the swag, to the AV, it truly made for an impressive & cohesive experience people will remember for years to come. Great work team!\n\n223#Making meeting participation possible|Thank you so much for your diligence in working with the hotel at Ignite to work around all my many dietary requirements. Without your help and concern, I would have had to either bring my own food or not fully participate in the meetings. You made it possible for me to get the most out of Ignite.\n\n224#Ignite 2013|It always amazes me to witness excellence.  Excellence is an ideal that is seldom reached but when it comes together, it is magical.  I want to thank you for the unbelievable effort you have put forth to make Ignite 2013 the best kickoff meeting in our company history.
