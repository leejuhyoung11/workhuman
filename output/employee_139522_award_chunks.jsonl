Your insight, collaboration, and attention to detail are greatly appreciated. I look forward to our continued collaboration on this project\n\n3#Post finalist meeting done well|Dinorah, Rich and Tom,  UMMS is making a final decision soon,  and this week's post finalist meeting on what to expect if they chose Workhuman could not have gone better.  Tom, you did a pheromonal job explaining our commitment and flexibility to \"deliver and grow\" with UMMS.  Rich and Dinorah, you both did an excellent job walking their team through the implementation and consulting process to launch their new program.   Thank you so much\n\n4#Showing Up for Humana|Jen, Kristine & Rich- well done executing today during the RCA call with Humana to review post launch glitches. Brittney raved about how this amazing trio showed up when it mattered the most, and demonstrated such phenominal partnership. Despite running into an unforeseen issue with PR employees, Brittney made it a point to reinforce just how amazing the responsiveness from this team was, from coming up with quick short and long term solutions, to implementing them within hours of raising the issue. Thank you all for responding with urgency, and showing what great looks like when you partner with Workhuman!   Special shout out to Jen for building such a fantastic partnership and deep trust with the Humana team as the launch lead. Brittney would have given you recognition if she could, so this ones from Brittney!   As Brittney said, with launching an enterprise recognition program, you expect to experience a few “glitches”, just as you would on your wedding day. It’s how you overcome those “glitches”, and just like rain on your wedding, or the hottest day of the year on your wedding, or even a fire alarm going off while walking down the aisle during a wedding, it becomes good luck!😂   Now let’s continue on with this positive momentum and help Humana drive a true culture of recogntion!\n\n5#Excellence in Action|As we wrap up Q3, I want to take a moment to celebrate a group of outstanding humans who have created incredible momentum across the business. This quarter you've shown what it means to have Respect for Quality - working across teams, delivering high-quality work, all while staying focused on what matters most: our mission to make work human. Your commitment to Inspire the HR Industry has shone through in the many accomplishments across the organization. As we head into the final quarter of the year, I’m filled with optimism about what we’ll continue to achieve together. Thank you for your hard work, your passion, and your commitment!\n\n6#Getting Humana's YOS Live|Team, I wanted to thank everyone who helped get Humana's years of service stood up last week. We were faced with some unexpected obstacles, but the team pulled together, communicated clearly and stayed aligned. By doing this we were able to get all of Humana's YOS awards delivered last week. It wasn't without some challenges but without the expertise and the ability to Pivot we would not have been successful. Thank you, team.\n\n7#Dialing in our Launch Messaging|Rich, Matt & Hari, recently you helped Jenn B and I think through a question that came up from a prospect who is now in contracts (Cvent) who asked about the LoE (Level of Effort) for a Workday HRIS resource during Launch. The materials we had in Siesmic were not clear about the distinction between a generic HRIS Launch vs a Workday Launch and you three weighed to help generate the clarity we needed to circle back to our future customer. Your timely responses meant a lot to Jenn and I, and our customer now has the level of detail they need to effectively prepare for their launch:)\n\n8#Rolls-Royce: It Takes a Village|Team, I wanted to thank you all for your teamwork and resilience over the last few weeks, as we've gone through some initial stages of the Rolls-Royce launch project. This is a large, complex, political client and we've had to do a lot of pivoting and strategizing to make sure we're putting our best foot forward as we work to meet the client's needs and expectations. Emily and James, I appreciate you keeping everyone informed about progress on the Sales side of things. Jose, Rich, Guil, Marie, and Niall, thank you for coming to the weekly internal meetings with your sleeves rolled up, ready to lend a hand as needed. Nuvs, you've been so helpful with your Product knowledge and experience as the client has come at us with various off-the-beaten-path requests. Brian, Brenda, Sinead, Dinorah, and Clare, thank you all for the copious amount of help with various time-sensitive requests like demo recordings, PLT update decks, working session strategy, etc. This one is going to truly take a village, and I'm so happy to have you all as my partners on this one.\n\n9#A Successful Return to Mid-Market!|Thank you all so much for your teamwork and support as we navigated the first Mid-Market launch since the return of Mid-Market! Caroline and Will, thank you for being so responsive and helping with the API addendum and providing context and additional details around my many questions as I started with Mortgage Connect. It was clear from Day 1 that you built an incredible foundation with Jaclyn and these additional pieces helped me keep that going. Matt and Rich, thank you for being there to brainstorm with me and offer suggestions around the current and future state of Mid-Market. The process Mortgage Connect experienced benefited from our discussions, and I know our learnings will improve key components of the launch experience for Mid-Market clients as we move forward. Judith, thank you for being my sounding board and talking through past and current experiences for Mid-Market clients. In many ways we started over with the Mid-Market process, and I'm grateful for your tribal knowledge and advice. I'm excited for our continued partnership and to see what's to come in the Mid-Market space!\n\n10#U.S. Bank Support!|Matt and Rich, Thank you both for the tremendous support you've provided this week for U.S. Bank. Rich I truly appreciate you jumping on several quick calls and generously offering your time to help navigate some complex program challenges. Your support makes all the difference in this launch! Matt thank you for meeting with me multiple times and for joining the call with U.S. Bank to help clarify concepts like SOLI. Your presence was incredibly valuable. These interactions go a long way, and between the two of you, I’ve felt massively supported. I genuinely appreciate your time and guidance! Thank you both!\n\n11#Humana's Workday Integration - All stars|Hello Team or better yet the Village that helped circle the wagons to help get Humana's Workday API integration stood up.  There are still some details to iron out but without this team I am confident that progress this week would not exist. Robin, thank you for jumping at the last minute to cover a call. Jess and Jamie, your Workday expertise appreciated! You both were able to help me trouble shoot and move this project forward. Rich thank you for helping lead the escalation request and make sure things continued to move while I was out. Thank you all!\n\n12#Partnership on IGT|Rich, Rahul — thank you both for your support during IGT’s recent company split.  Despite a few unexpected curveballs (ahem, surprise SSO changes), you were instrumental in guiding both me and our IGT counterparts through the transition.  We successfully set up their new group and delivered the experience they were hoping for, all while keeping the door open for future opportunities to tailor each program to their unique needs.  I truly appreciate your partnership.  Thank you again!\n\n13#OOO Coverage|Rich and Jess, thank you both for providing coverage as I was out of the office for a couple of days. Jess, you made yourself available for Dana Farber if they had any questions during my absence and assisted with some config work regarding IGT. Rich, thank you for leading the final push with IGT as there were some final challenges to cross the finish line such as their SSO access and invoicing. I am always appreciative of our team coming together to provide support so we can take time off knowing things will move forward. Thank you!\n\n14#Thank you ALL for pulling together for Logitech!|I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for leaning in with your support, advice, insights, and time to help turn around the very last minute Logitech brief for today's pitch. We were already working against tight timelines, and then had a change of direction added on top, but everyone showed up willing to help and brought invaluable expertise, keeping the standard high throughout.  On a personal note, I learned so much from you all that I’ll carry forward into future conversations. Looking forward to working with you again soon - hopefully with a little more notice next time!\n\n15#You are a star|Thank you for your enthusiastic and engaged participation in the service model workshop. Your energy, insights, and willingness to engage made the session a great running start for our work together.  Your contributions—whether through thoughtful questions, creative ideas, or collaborative discussions—played a vital role in shaping the outcomes of the workshop.   Thank you for your time, effort, and commitment we know it takes a lot to spend this kind of time in workshops!\n\n16#New Customer Alert: Welcome USB!|Big congratulations to Dawn and the entire Workhuman team for winning USB! Like any major sales deal, we faced unique prospect requests, challenges, and a few last-minute twists. But thanks to the team’s dedication, hard work, and strong rapport with the USB leaders, persistence paid off. This account has been worked on feverishly since the first meeting in Q3 2023. WH became a finalist in USB’s RFP process in Q4 2024, presented finalist pitch in Q1 2025, and officially became their VOC in Q1 2025. It became clear their previous vendor, Augeo, struggled to connect business results to outcomes—and the USB team was ready to elevate their employee experience. USB pushed us to be great, and we delivered. We responded by developing a custom employee survey to ensure every voice is heard, and partnered with Submittable, an all-in-one award management platform, to help centralize recognition efforts and run seamless internal competitions. These solutions showcased our commitment to innovation, excellence, and Recognition Done Right. Additionally, our incredible team doubled down on what mattered most—delivering a clear understanding of success metrics, creating a frictionless employee experience, and empowering moments of authentic recognition. From seamless workflows to a culture of gratitude, we proved we could be the strategic, innovative, and experienced partner USB was looking for. We’re thrilled to welcome USB, with 80,000 employees in the banking and finance industry, to the Workhuman community—and we’re proud to see them quickly become champions of our mission. A huge shoutout to the extended Workhuman team who made this possible. Leading the charge was Dawn O’Brien, whose leadership, work ethic, and relationship-building were critical to our success. Thank you all for your incredible contributions—and CONGRATULATIONS on a huge win!  Recognition Done Right isn’t just a slogan. It’s what we do!\n\n17#Customers First at Workhuman Live 2025|Thank you to our incredible Customer team for the tremendous work, energy, and professionalism you brought to the Workhuman Live 2025. Your dedication was evident in every interaction and every detail — from the big moments to the behind-the-scenes efforts that made it all run smoothly and drive a great experience for our customers.  Your presence at the Customer and Pioneer Events helped create memorable experiences and deepen our relationships with key attendees. During Demos, you showcased our latest functionality with clarity and enthusiasm, helping customers see the real impact the platform and building excitement around HI.    Whether scanning badges or running microphones during breakout sessions, you were everywhere — ensuring things flowed smoothly and that everyone felt seen and heard. You joined customers for breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, turning meals into meaningful conversations.   And of course, you played a pivotal role in setting up meetings, holding space for important discussions, and introducing our executives — making sure every touchpoint felt personal and impactful.  All this effort helped drive success this week. Thank you!\n\n18#Heart & Hustle|To everyone who traveled to Denver and rolled up their sleeves to support our flagship event—thank you.  There are dozens of jobs, big and small, that need to come together to make an event like this work—and you did them all. From demo delivering to activation staffing, room management to speaker wrangling, customer hosting to Gratitude Bar support—every task you took on was vital to the experience we delivered.  Your energy, flexibility, and willingness to step in wherever needed didn’t go unnoticed. This event’s success was built on your hard work, and we are deeply grateful for everything you gave—your time, your effort, your talent, and your care.  Thank you for showing up, again and again. You made this event possible.\n\n19#My Teams Usability Testing 🔍|Thank you for taking the time to participate in usability testing and share your thoughts on the new My Team designs! 💻 We truly appreciate your insights and are excited to incorporate your feedback in the near future!! 💡\n\n20#Important Transitions|Thank you for joining our team call this week, Rich, with a RICH and detailed refresher on the topics we can be listening for in Sales Consulting. By calling these out in detail and explaining the impact they have on implementation and launch, you helped prime our ears and pique our curiosity in service to our teams' efforts around the CE goal to improve the cross-functional handover process. We appreciate your expertise and collaboration!\n\n21#Jumping In with IGT|Rich, thank you for your partnership on the upcoming project with IGT.  It was great having you on the call this week to share your expertise.  Specifically on the call with IGT, they were starting to lean towards the option of configuring two unique populations within the same site.  You immediately showed them why it would be in their interest (and ours) to move forward with a new site configuration for the new population.  Furthermore, this keeps the door open for a future opportunity with this new entity.  I truly appreciate your insight and perspective in these scenarios.  Thank you again for your support!\n\n22#Hyperspeed for Humana|Team, I wanted to thank each of you for your help with getting the Humana launch off on the right foot. During the design lab it was made clear that the leadership team at Humana wanted to have sandbox access ASAP to roadshow to there more than 50k employees how easy the Workhuman solution would be. To accomplish this task, we needed to put the enablement of the new UI 3.0 (culture hub) into hyper-drive! This team grouped together and pulled off something that had not been done before converting a customer in less than week, in only a day and half from when we started asking questions. Thank you to this team, this was a huge win for this project! Thanks!\n\n23#Turning Around Asks Quicker Than 11m!|Really really thankful to this expert team on everything pre-production! In order to demonstrate conformance to European Accessibility Act standards set for enactment later this year, Workhuman needs to conduct an independent audit of our platform. Product and Engineering have made tremendous strides in making our code a11y ready over the last 6 months of Surge and thanks to this team here we now have a production-like stable environment that we can give our auditors access to. I honestly get confused between the many different pre-production sites but nuvs, Rich, and Brian are patient and thoughtful in their guidance, balancing safety and security when providing external access to our platform. With this crew, we were able to sort out a path forward to meet the vendors availability and not have to backtrack on already aligned timeline.\n\n24#Thousands of Tickets - Turning Insight Into Action|Team - I want to take a moment to recognize and thank each of you who dedicated your time and energy to reviewing thousands of customer technical support tickets. This was no small task—and yet, you approached it with persistence, thoughtfulness, and a shared commitment to truly understanding our customers ... even at 6:00AM!  We've identified themes and unearthed insights that are directly shaping our product roadmap—ensuring we stay aligned with what our customers need most, not just today, but for the future. With this deeper level of understanding, we will not only address pain points, but also find smarter ways to work, streamline internal processes, and unlock new opportunities for customer self-service.  You’ve helped turn a mountain of data into a clearer path forward for both our teams and our customers. Thank you for your diligence, your collaboration, and for keeping the voice of the customer at the heart of what we do.\n\n25#Rallying around for Lloyds|Team - when we received a last-minute request from Lloyds for a planning discovery session you were quick to confirm your support and participation. Despite the fairly vague brief you worked together to craft a concise and clear overview of how we will support Lloyds in the launch phase and beyond. As you delivered your segments it was lovely to see the smiles and nods of appreciation from their project team. Across an hour you were able to allay all of their concerns and give them real confidence in the next stages of our partnership. You truly demonstrated the best of Workhuman and I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to leverage your combined expertise. Thank you!\n\n26#It takes a Village!|A HUGE thank you to this Incredible team for everyone's focus and help in putting our very best foot forward at every step of R-R's process (so far). We're still on our journey with R-R and doing everything possible to earn their business, but so much outstanding work has been done by our team over the past few months that I wanted to recognise your collaboration, dedication and creativity. A special call-out to Mark Simon for an outstanding RFP proposal, to the Finalist Presentation team (nuvs for being as cool as a cucumber when the tech wasn't behaving!), to Sinead, Clare & Emily for investing so much time in our Derby visit to learn about R-R's culture, history and Apprentice programme, to Maureen for your creative genius with various decks, and to Lisa, Jim and team on scripts and videos! So much care and urgency from everyone involved in trying to win R-R's business. Here's to continuing to impress R-R at every twist and turn on our continuing journey with them - THANK YOU All!\n\n27#A Great 2025 Launch Offsite!|Rich - you always show up, lead, and deliver for our annual launch offsites, and yesterday's in the office was no different. Thank you for prepping a meaningful, engaging, and useful agenda that was well-paced, fun, and allowed the Launch team to discuss important topics. From DiSC, the Investment Calculator, and Continuous Improvement, you balanced fun with meaningful discussions to get us excited for rest of 2025 while celebrating 2024. Thank you for your efforts to put this session together and for running an outstanding meeting all day (plus dinner!).\n\n28#Rich to the Rescue!|I was working through an issue for a few weeks with ADP being able to access PPL's production FTP and was hitting multiple roadblocks. I had opened a couple tickets that weren't producing a resolution, and was running out of ideas for how to fix the issue. Rich saw one of my tickets and reached out with the key information that was needed and even a guide on how to resolve the issue. This was done quickly and ADP confirmed this morning that they can now access the FTP. The client was very happy to see that we were able to move forward without their needing to get involved. Thank you Rich!\n\n29#Thanks for the Paternity Leave Coverage!|Matt and Rich - thank you both for your support and coverage while I was away for the last 8 weeks taking care of Evelyn. This was a time in my life where I was able to fully focus on my family and spend meaningful time with Evelyn each day. Matt, you stepped in right as my leave started to work on a UMass escalation, helped facilitate leaves for multiple employees, and took over specific launch projects for FM Global and Seadrill. Rich, you worked to set me up for the most success as I came back yesterday, giving me a weekly play-by-play document from each of the past 8 weeks to show me the changes that took place while I was gone and working with Matt as changes on my team came up. Thank you both, I appreciate the support!!\n\n30#Meet Our Humans Feature|Thank you Rich for sharing your inspiring career journey as part of our latest “Meet Our Humans” Feature.

Matt, you stayed connected with me, especially when we had to navigate the gross-up and the budget challenges. Rich, every time we had our 1-1 you would ask me about Zentiva, and would offer guidance any time I need, sometimes I didn't even need to ask. Also, with all the changes Zentiva requested the week prior to their launch, you offered to QA our work and also, but also helped us to change them to make sure they were future proof. I really appreciate both of you!\n\n32#Personifying urgency|I want to recognise this group for the way you all stepped in and supported responding to the prospect questions we received mid-Activate.

Rich, thank you for responding to my request for help right away, and for calling in the marketing cavalry!

Team, Congratulations on this milestone step with Humana: tonight, we got the call saying “We want to work with You.” We still have steps to take, but I want to celebrate this win, and this milestone. It took effort and dedication to get here, and this feeling that we collectively did this together is why I love working with our Workhuman team. Many on this list made last minute adjustments to schedules to fly onsite, others took evening calls, answered late emails, slacked in the early morning and then moved schedules around to prepare, get briefed and then execute a final important Meet the Team step. I appreciate every single one of you who joined me in waving the proverbial rally towel and said Let’s Do This!  Much gratitude for all y’alls Can Do Attitude! #42 #GSD\n\n40#Bravo! to Our Ferguson Launch Team|Join me in celebrating the launch of the Ferguson Bravo! platform, which includes R&R, YOS, Automated Welcome Award and Celebrations to 32,000 employees across 5 countries in 5 languages.

What always stands out to me in every interaction we have is the care you have for the team and how much you want us to succeed. This time was no different.

After a 29-month cycle, I am extremely excited to share that they are the newest member of the WH customer family adding 50,000 more users to our platform!  It was a win that required significant effort and strategy led by Sameer with support from so many WH team members along the way to ensure we had a positive outcome.  During the course of the process we had more than 70 documented meetings and every engagement and deposit made was very intentional. This included having several key Qualcomm executives at WHLive, many “moments that mattered” (YOS videos, Birthday videos, delivering WH golf balls/shirts, even a video from Snapdragon stadium which is sponsored by Qualcomm), a strong ABM campaign (Custom demo, microsite, mood video), and lots of customer storytelling to create unparalleled levels of credibility.  This sales process was a rollercoaster ride with lots of twists and turns resulting in a head-to-head competition with Augeo who promised the world at highly aggressive prices. But at the end of the day Qualcomm realized that our level of experience, product capabilities, and strategic value we provide are hands down the best in the industry and we became the obvious choice.  This would not have happened without the tireless work of all involved including Hari Date, Nuvs, Erin Avery, Cam Torre, Martina Campbell, Jason Gori, Meisha-Ann Martin, Larry Dennison, Alessandra Fagone, Brian Moore, Brian Kennedy, Owen Cooney, Christopher Claude, Julia Towle, Emily Smith, Hillary Mahoney, Chuck Labovitz, Rich Sorrentino, Rahul Srinivasan, Nick Eng, Ekaterina Kim, and Nina Reichert.  Thank you for going above and beyond to support this important sale!\n\n47#Thanks for presenting the customer launch process|Dear Amy and Rich,  I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for taking the time to present the customer launch workflow/process to me. Your detailed explanations and patient responses to all my questions were incredibly helpful. I truly appreciate your effort in making the session informative and engaging, along with providing tips and emphasis for future collaborations.  Thank you for your dedication and support. Best regards, Yariv\n\n48#Designing Service & Support Future|Thank you for your outstanding dedication and engagement over the last 2 days. Each of you brought unique perspective, experience and insight into the workshop. Thanks to you, we have a strong foundation for building the maturity of our service and support capability over 2025.\n\n49#Launch Lyfe|I am so indebted to you all for your help on the implementation challenges and pitfalls section of my upcoming chapter. This is an effort I am excited about and have never done before. So when the editor asked for a section on this, I went to the experts. I knew you were experts which is why I sought you out, but man oh man oh man, did you ever show up and show out. This is nowhere near in your day job at all and I know you all have full plates and yet you made the time. No half stepping. You gave me so much to choose from and you even did a read through of what I wrote at the last minute. I can't say thank you enough. When I do something that stretches me and makes me a little uncomfortable, it is so great to know I have people like you in my corner to help. Thank you so very very much.\n\n50#Novo going to give you up|Team, I want to thank you all for your significant contributions to the Novo Nordisk RFP presentation and demo. The request from Novo was to bring their vision to life with a concise, strategic presentation and it was inspiring to see each of you deliver your sections with impact and precision.   The demo from Marcy and nuvs in particular was hugely engaging and Joyce, Meisha-Ann and Eliza did a fantastic job of articulating how Workhuman is uniquely positioned to support Novo's global recognition initiative. Rich S, John, Emily and Orlagh responded to the Novo team Q&A with authority and efficiency. And our custom demo environment was expertly (and speedily!) crafted by Brian Moore - the look and feel got a nod of appreciation from the Novo team.  This was yet another occasion where I felt very proud to work alongside such a great bunch of humans - thank you for your support!\n\n51#5 stars would recommend|Rich, thank you for the time and effort you put into the Q2 review for the launch team. These meetings always make me leave inspired by the team’s success and motivated to keep going. This session you highlighted that it was Pina Colada Day and even recruited Kat to help maximize the event, pulled together interesting statistics, and found news ways for the team to get to know each other better.  Appreciate all you do every day for the culture of the launch team and the continued focus on the future. 5 Stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n52#Support Superstar!|Rich, thank you so much for jumping in and helping me to handle a tricky cross-departmental conversation today. Even with your busy schedule, you made time to understand the background of the conversation, collaborated with me on a strategy of how to handle some sensitive internal dynamics, and ultimately helped move the conversation along much more quickly. I am grateful for the way that you're always working to elevate the Launch brand, support us LSMs, and provide an example of what we can all aspire to. You're a superstar!\n\n53#Great impact|Something so simple is having a great impact! Moving to an Asana agenda for our weekly CLS/LS/TS check-in has allowed us to be more organized and efficient. I appreciate your continual approach to look at any situation with an eye towards fine tuning it for efficiency. This is just one example that makes a difference in what we do.\n\n54#Payroll doc!|Team - thank you for jumping on an urgent request as we look to close Danaher down for the quarter. You are pulled in your own existing knowledge, with ways to create something that was clean, simple, and high-level for the prospect. Thank you team!\n\n55#Manhattan - A Spirited Launch Celebration!|Join me in congratulating the entire Manhattan launch team! Manhattan has launched its Spirit Program in a unique fashion with Years of Service and Quarterly 'Spirit Award' (WBAU-only) to 2545 employees in 13 countries.  We have a lot to celebrate and must take a moment to highlight some outstanding teamwork. Jenn, thank you for skillfully navigating challenging conversations around physical awards, gift cards, and tax considerations.  William, your consistent best practice guidance was invaluable. Even when the client wasn’t fully prepared for the recommended approach, you adapted and met them where they were.  Robin, your support, documentation, and voice during Workday integration were truly appreciated.  Dylan, an enormous thank you for your top-notch technical support in UAT, Production Testing, and YOS Catch-up WBAU.  Aidan and ihar, the Manhattan branding was a complete success and highlight for the client project team and other client stakeholders.  Thank you for your flexibility and patience as this launch required both.  Ruchi and Divya, thank you for your support and troubleshooting for our client.  While we navigated some challenging discussions in this launch, I consider it an amazing success that our client's SPIRIT is positive and focused on future growth.  THANK YOU TO THIS FANTASTIC TEAM!\n\n56#GE is Grateful for YOU!!|A big shout out to this team for the incredible work that is being done at GE. Ellie, our GE program manager, reached out to me to express her gratitude for this team's efforts. Here is the message from Ellie: \"Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the support and partnership of the Workhuman Team, especially over the last few weeks. As you know, there is a great deal of uncertainty and pressure over here and I just want to express my appreciation for the patience and understanding by all\".  It's very powerful when we hear this type of feedback directly from such a high-stake client. So proud of this team. Cheers!\n\n57#Creating an amazing team culture|Amy, Rich and Nick, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for making the time to meet me, answering my questions last week, and for helping me to settle in my new role. The opportunity to engage with our dynamic team in person was incredibly valuable, and I am deeply appreciative. When I joined the team, the first thing I noticed was the team spirit, and how everyone was there to support one another, and after spending a week in person with the team, I can tell we learnt this by example. So, I wanted to thank you for making the time on your busy agendas to meet with me, get to know me, not only as a professional, but as a person, and to make me feel as part of the team, even being 2.6k miles away (yeah, I have googled it).\n\n58#Thorough at the speed of light !|Rich, thank you so much for your incredibly quick responses for an important and time sensitive Qualcomm document. You were quick to answer, detailed and thorough and I really appreciate your insight and extensive knowledge base!\n\n59#A great partner...|Rich - I have to call out and thank you for your great partnership with me/CSM team.  I have always known your dedication level is high but really have seen more first hand lately with your ongoing Minto projects.  You recently informed me about an additional ask by the Minto team that is unrelated/outside of the current build of Celebrations, and how it was somewhat urgent.  While the CRF was heavily in use with the other pending projects, you found a way to get the award reason updated/deployed and the WBAU processed to satisfy the client need.  I appreciate you keeping me informed and sharing your progress on this item.  You are a true team player and I wanted to make my appreciation known.\n\n60#Mthanks for Moody's|Team, I want to extend a huge thank you for your support during the Moody's early decision guidance call today. You all achieved the perfect balance between partnership, guidance and professionalism.  There is no question you generated plenty of excitement with the Moody's team, while qualifying their enthusiasm with practical best practices and caveats.  Thank you again for stepping up and delivering like pros!!  To add....not sure how I feel about their proposed program name....Mthanks.  I think they can do better....Mpower for example (credit to Flavin).\n\n61#Pulling Together for PayPal|Team, I want to express gratitude from the bottom of my heart for acting with urgency and customer focus this week as we pulled together to troubleshoot and resolve some mission-critical and time sensitive issues. Matt (squared), Brian, and Luka, thank you for helping to investigate and coordinate resolution for their Workday integration issues. Dave, thank you for sticking on late with me to try and re-load their data to refresh Production. Rich, thank you for helping me to make some crucial text updates to take down references to mobile in the site, and for looping in Kevin to help. Kevin, Aidan, and Val, thank you for all of the help in taking down the link to mobile from the homepage and making some other last-minute branding updates. Last but not least, Ger and Robert, thank you for taking the time to jump on SSO troubleshooting calls to unblock the client's launch blocker! We're so close to launch we can taste it, and this team is heavily contributing to our success!\n\n62#NESO - putting the cart behind the horse|Rich, thank you for helping out on NESO manage preschedule calls. This launch has a unique approach which required us to put the cart before the horses. We are all well on our way to getting everything back in order. Appreciate your help jumping in on a call today when I was already double booked, in addition to representing the team you provided me with the takeaways to keep the program moving forward. Thanks for your help getting the horse back in the lead.\n\n63#Leading us through the DMARColypse|I want to recognize the incredible efforts and dedication each of you has shown in protecting Workhuman's sender reputation. Your collective work on this initiative has been nothing short of exceptional. From raising awareness of the new Google and Yahoo requirements to gauging client impact and risk, collaborating on client-facing materials, making changes in our system, and supporting one another through every step, your commitment to excellence and collaboration has been truly inspiring. Thanks to the collective effort of this group, we have protected Workhuman and our clients deliverability health, and ensured the experience of our end-users remained smooth and uninterrupted. Thank you all for your leadership!\n\n64#James closes Aptiv for $2 million....|Aptiv has more than 200,000 employees globally and is an automotive technology supplier. Their starting point is a global recognition programme for their 25,000 online employees and we have every intention of growing this over time.   Aptiv was just over a year in the making and the deal team involved in helping to win them has been extensive. Naomi was very involved from the outset, leading multiple engaging workshops with a range of senior Aptiv stakeholders – she seriously impressed and helped put us in pole position during Aptiv’s extensive RFP process. Meghan Honan leveraged her deep knowledge of our client base to propose some rock solid customer references. Orlagh Lynch, Brian Moore, Kevin Fischer, Lisa Cripps, Mark Simon and Michael Robb all worked their magic on our RFP response and helped ensure that Aptiv was never in any doubt as to our unique differentiators and how to set us apart from all the wannabes – Aptiv loved the branded demo site that Brian & Kevin created for them! The finalist onsite presentation involved Rich Sorrentino, Michael Smith, Rahul Srinivasan, Naomi Dishington and Tom V – Aptiv’s CPO, Obed, was very impressed by the presentation and shortly afterwards met up with Eric Mosley for dinner and a discussion – thank you  Eric!   With  tight launch goal ambitions, we convinced Aptiv to use our contract docs and Julia Towle did a masterful job of getting them in-line with our requirements in what was close to record time. Commercial negotiations with Procurement required an onsite meeting in Dublin and Steve C and Tom V gave a masterclass in how to negotiate with a very tough procurement team. A huge thanks to all of those involved in this win.  James - once again you deliver on your forecast and you a role model of what great sales execution looks like. Your laser focus day in and day out, sharp  business acumen, deep product expertise and endless charm is just a magic combination. YOU ARE GOLD.\n\n65#Old Days to Nowadays!|Rich, it has been so fun to collaborate with you recently and brings me back to the \"old days.\" The world of launch has come a very long way since then and I love to see the evolution. I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your willingness and enthusiasm jumping in to recent projects. Having your support and collaboration is a key part to our success. Thank you so much!\n\n66#An Electrifying Win With ESO|Congratulations to James McNeil who has closed his first deal of 2024 with ESO for $635k. ESO is the electricity system operator for the UK and they are all so excited to partner with WH following  National Grid’s very successful recently launched recognition programme. Last week they told us how important it was for them to partner with such a respected recognition vendor :-)   As always, we has to work through  lots of contractual negotiations, which touched on InfoSec and security controls (thank you both Michael Robb and Orlagh as ever on your responsiveness and thoroughness) Thank you also to  Chuck in Finance for your support with the commercial terms, and Rich Sorrentino for engaging with the ESO project team on various programme design queries whilst in parallel we finalised the contract negotiations (incredibly helpful and strategic). Finally, as ever, there was impressive leadership from the Legal team, where they helped to get ESO aligned with the right way to structure the agreement – Christie and Hillary were creative, responsive and collaborative at every twist and turn of the process. A huge thanks to you both, we’re incredibly lucky to have such a strong team!!    A big shout out to you James - your hard work and consistent  determination is always so impressive to watch.\n\n67#ATS Phase 2 Expansion Win|Ankur and Team, congrats on an expansion win at ATS.  While we know this was no easy lift, we continue to successfully grow this relationship.  Ankur, your ability to build a candid and direct relationship with the primary business owner was ultimately the key to getting this across the finish line.  Christie and Chuck, thank you for supporting the financial and legal pieces of this puzzle!  And Rich, thank you for jumping in from a support standpoint and solutioning some challenges with the launch that gave ATS comfort to advance the process.  This is a great example of a land and expand as this client grows in their geographic footprint.  Congrats on a nice Canadian win!!\n\n68#Appreciate your partnership!|Rich- I wanted to say thank you so much for your ongoing partnership with the CSM team! You have been such a great sounding board and resource for myself and the team and we appreciate you very much! Recently, there was a very last minute ask of the CSM team to get 40 or so customers to make changes to their subdomain. You have offered to join customer calls so the team gets the support we need, even though the scope of that work doesn’t necessarily fall under launch specifically. I also see you consistently respond to questions in the CS questions slack channel that the CSM team asks. You have so much knowledge and experience to share with others. Thank you again for always being a great partner to our team! We appreciate you!\n\n69#A Hole in One Offsite|The launch offsite was a thoughtful approach to celebrating as a team and individually, connecting to the strategy board and infusing thought leadership. Showcasing the launch mission statement, tying it this this year’s strategy board and weaving it throughout the day brings clarity on how this team influences the overarching goals. The sessions on Workday and communication styles were key topics to further hone our skills. With the loss of Dan Fiore, we took over the responsibility of being Workday experts in the launch process. This learning continues to build the team's comfort level and confidence. Chuck and Judy speaking about Customer Account Profitability and Deal Desk was the top topic of the day. The team appreciated learning deeper details on how Finance looks at the business, how the Deal Desk process can be influenced by and for launch, and of course building relationships between teams. Our team looks forward to these sessions because they are insightful, challenging, developmental and fun. And that is all thanks to you!\n\n70#Outstanding Team Collaboration|Expressing the sheer incredibility of our team is quite a challenge. Each day, you all manage to astound me. A massive shoutout to Matt Gillen, Nick Eng, and every single one of you for offering exceptional support to our team. Your collaboration is truly outstanding and immensely valued. Thank you all for dedicating your time to collaborate last week - you guys truly rock! Rich, thanks for being my Boston buddy!\n\n71#Client Call Rockstars!|Thank you to Gerard, Luka, and Rich for jumping on a late request for a client call last week. You all were integral to supporting this client with their SSO configuration concerns. Thank you all so much for your help troubleshooting on this one!\n\n72#My two heroes|Don't you love it when teammates come in and solve everything? ☺️ That happened when Allianz requested platform access to conduct accessibility testing.  Stephanie, I want to thank you for your proactive action back in December—when you heard about this request, you reached out to learn more, educated me about the proper way to make this work right, and aligned the right people & tools to ensure we were prepared.  Next came Rich—the clock was ticking on having a logical place for the new customer to test last month. The ink was barely dry on the contract, and I asked for your help to see if we could set up a Sandbox tenant in just a few days. You sprang into action, checked for an existing tenant, and quickly configured it with username/password access. The next day, I reached out to you when I found some issues, and you went back in, identified the problem, and took steps to get Finance to make adjustments to make it all work (I only learned later that you were actually off that day!). Thank you both for your respect for urgency and quality!\n\n73#Team Rio Makes a Difference Today|We did it! RockStars is live! What a fantastic culmination of this team’s effort over the past 7 months. Putting aside the challenge of it, today is what matters, when the thing we worked so hard on together starts delivering the impact we know it’s capable of. We’ve been saying, “It’s all gonna be great when it’s live.” And it is. After a project when positivity felt hard to come by, today is nothing but.   James, your Exec Sponsor relationship mattered more than in any launch I’ve seen before. Thank you for handling the hard bits with trust and professionalism. Glenn, thank you for your early and dedicated investment in RockStars’ success. You’ve shown Rio the full measure of what it feels like to be our customer. Jose, it was inspiring and humbling to watch you in action on this project. You are an incredible leader. Thank you for doing the right thing for the business at every turn. Rich, your keen sense for what to communicate when made such a difference in pivotal moments and served as powerful lessons for me. Matt C., what a test of, and testament to, your resilience. Your troubleshooting, organization, responsiveness, and good nature got us over the finish line. Matt G., you missed exactly zero beats stepping in. Transitions are delicate but your tech and PM chops gave Rio full trust in you. Dinorah, you invested the most off-hours meeting time in a launch, ever. For your customer focus and relentlessness in pointing them to strategic decisions, thank you.  Together, we delivered some groundbreaking stuff in one of the most complex launches in our history. In existential moments about my life choices, I thought about the miners in Guinea, doing dangerous jobs, who don’t read or write, who go home to spotty electricity and running water. It might not be overstating it to say we’ve brought \"I am valued\" feelings to people who need it most. A proud day, Team Rio. Congratulations!\n\n74#Leadership and beyond|Even though I mentioned it on our end of day touch base call regarding Rio’s launch, I want to reinforce it again here. I have seen you go above and beyond on the leadership for this launch. Your additional oversight at specific points in the process has allowed our team to stay ahead of the customer. Your understanding of how this customer reacts coupled with your experience has allowed us to be proactive. You helped us avoid unnecessary difficult situations. Rio was a challenging customer and we hit some bumps along the way. I am thankful for your resilience and perseverance supporting the team and the customer. I see and appreciate you, Rich!\n\n75#Humans Discovering Solutions for Discover|Our work with Discover has been somewhat challenging, but having the right team on the job makes things much better!  Solutioning on the fly regarding payroll files, Workday integration, partner solutions and so much more wouldn't have happened without having the experts participate in advance and on the call.  This team supported the planning, exploration, validation, and story development.  It definitely wouldn't have happened with a bunch of robots!!\n\n76#The Buyer Journey Panel|I hope you are still buzzing from the amazing kick off last week and I just wanted to extend my sincerest thanks for all of the hard work and prep that went into making the panel a reality. I know I threw a weird format at you with all that back-and-forth, no one believed Ken could keep it under 5 minutes, and Meisha-Ann was pulling double duty speaking on behalf of both teams – but it turned out to be fantastic! I'm always mining for on-stage talent around here, so don't be surprised if I come asking again – you were all excellent! The work you put in to boil down your story and share its value definitely showed and I think you may have started a new session worthy of repeating at future kick-offs. Thank you for all the enthusiasm and for letting me jump in to help it find its way to main stage.\n\n77#Celebrating Excellence|We have just added a wonderful new customer into the Workhuman family in PayPal, and there are some lofty goals to support a desired launch for Employee Appreciation Day.  This team has come together to lead with passion and energy and build a level of confidence within the PayPal team, showing them that we deliver an incredible experience with true excellence.  There are so many values that could have been selected to use for this award, but it's definitely a team effort all the way around. Kat, your leadership through this process has been nothing short of spectacular.  Joyce, Lauren, Bryant, and David, your support and guidance to help PayPal on this journey to provide a world class employee recognition program for their people.  Your willingness to support wherever it is needed Nuvs is always appreciated...and in this case taking on the potential to expand our solution by adding PayPal/Venmo as a 'Top Off' option, among many other things.  Your involvement early in the process Meisha-ann should pay dividends in the form of data, case studies, and lots of amazing statistics for both PayPal and the Workhuman team to share with the world.  And last but not least, \"Thank You\" Mr. Sorrentino for assembling this All-Star Squad.  It's amazing to share with our future customers why they should choose to partner with Workhuman, and even better to know that your team is going to come in and deliver.  I'm truly grateful for all of you, and I look forward to watching this relationship flourish!!!\n\n78#Arkansas Children's Awesome Launch Team!|Let's Celebrate the Arkansas Children's launch including R&R, YOS, and the Celebrations Bundle to over 6000 dedicated employees.  This launch was a true team effort with MS Teams & Outlook Integrations, recurring Wellness Points WBAUs, Gratitude Summit and more.  The Arkansas Children's Awards Feed is flooded with heartwarming and authentic moments of gratitude.  THANK YOU to every awesome member of this team that made this launch possible!\n\n79#Commitment to Excellence|Dear Rich,  Thank you for your continued support of GE HeathCare. You have been a guiding light to the client as well as to your internal team. Your commitment to collaboration and teamwork has been key to success and has made a world of difference, instilling trust and confidence along the way. I appreciate your ownership, knowledge and dedication, all of which have enabled our success -- thank you!\n\n80#\"Impact\"ing GE Healthcare|Congratulations on the launch of GE Healthcare, Rich! This launch had some tricky items along the way and each one was handled with urgency and care. Your leadership and expertise provided confidence to the GE team from the start. Your under-control poise and action if we hit a bump in the project further showcased GE was in the best hands. Issues were quickly resolved, and we were back on track.  The biggest compliment was being a trusted advisor to Ellie with her reaching out to you separately to share her feedback on the great work you’ve been doing on this launch. It’s been wonderful to see and hear the journey of this launch and congratulations on this milestone launch day!\n\n81#Lightning speed success - $8.5M Win PayPal|What an incredible whirlwind of activities to get to this win with PayPal. Thanks to Sameer for leading the accelerated Close Plan that enabled final signature within a month of creating the opportunity! There are many notable achievements around this deal. First, ensuring ongoing customer excellence. People move from companies that are customers of Workhuman. When they have an amazing experience with the recognition program, they tell others. A top executive at Intuit, a Workhuman customer for nearly two decades, became the CEO at PayPal. When he arrived, he told his team, “We need recognition.” Workhuman was not the only choice, we had competition. This leads to the second notable reason we won; responsiveness and attention to their needs. We were told that “another company didn’t respond or pay much attention to the opportunity,” but Sameer did. Finally, the third reason we won, acting with urgency.  Looking back at my notes, we informed Tom V of this opportunity on Nov. 20.  It wasn’t in the pipeline just over 35 short days ago!  Don’t be fooled, the team had to execute the same selling steps to complete – confirmation and approval of budget, completing the security assessment and numerous vendor questionnaires, passing the vendor onboarding process, demos to the business, procurement, and legal teams, conducting early decision guidance, committing to bi-weekly cadence calls, and negotiating the agreement and legal requirements.  Many thanks to those who assisted in getting this deal done in an expeditious manner with huge shouts outs to Christie Hynds, Nina Reichert, Chuck Labovitz, Chris O’Sullivan, Hillary Mahoney, Doug Fries, Michael Robb, Orlagh Lynch, Rich Sorrentino, Mindi Ennis, Weichen Zhu, Jim Gregoire, Liam Farrell, Nuvs, Nick Solis and Tom V.  We are excited to welcome PayPal to the Workhuman family and partner with one of the world's most recognized brands.\n\n82#Ericsson RFP Submittal- Finish Line|Thank you team for your continuous support in submitting the Ericsson RFP. Time was not definitely on our side with this one, which included a number of moving parts involving agreements, SLAs, PPI, Implementation, global redemptions, pre-paid cards, strange product functionality requests, etc. With only a week allowed to respond to over 450 questions, complete a thorough country spreadsheet and more; you all came through in the clutch. There is no way it would've been submitted on time without your contributions (my apologies if you get tired of my email, slack and teams notifications). I hope you all enjoy the holidays as it's well deserved!!  Michael\n\n83#Building a partnership with Rio|Thank you to Brenda, Dinorah, Glenn, Rich & James for travelling to Brisbane, preparing for our meeting & contributing excellently as we build our partnership with Rio. The timing & urgency of this was challenging but everyone jumped in & ensured we made a positive impact & continued to build the foundations for our launch in February & our long term partnership. I thank each of you for the early mornings prepping, strategising on the best approach & pivoting in the moment. You are RockStars & it’s great to see the smiling team at the end of our 2 days!\n\n84#Celebrate! the MUSC Launch Team!|AN ENOURMOUS THANK YOU to the entire team that supported the Medical University of South Carolina's Launch!  MUSC launched Celebrate! with Plateau YOS, Celebrations Bundle and R&R set for Spring 2024 to over 20,000 employees and healthcare providers.  MUSC will celebrate its Bicentennial next year and needed a strategic recognition partner who would respect their 200-year traditions  while deepening their culture of gratitude and community.  Lisa, thank you for the awesome relationship you built with MUSC as well as the critical coordination efforts with our WH eCommerce team.  Dinorah, I am grateful for the strategy and care you provided MUSC, flexing to meet their communication/training needs on this quick launch.  Aidan and ihar, a tremendous thank you for your skill and hard work in meeting a tight timeline. Dylan, thank you for your thoughtful technical support and UAT prep.  To the Integrations and CL&S team members that supported this launch, thank you for your partnership and patience in troubleshooting and executing on SSO, WD API, MS Teams Integration and more.  CONGRATULATIONS to the entire team who contributed to and supported this launch!\n\n85#Launch 101|Rich & Judith – As we were working through plans for a phased launch of a new digital tool we thought, \"You know what would be great, is to hear from someone who's done this before.\" And we are so grateful to have Launch Success colleagues who were willing to share their time, resources, and expertise to help another department with some Launch 101! We took tons of notes on all the tips you shared that will positively impact the success of our project, and we are so thankful for your collaborative spirit. Thank you!\n\n86#DuPont Dedication 🙌|Shayna and I wanted to express our gratitude for dedicating your time to support a call with DuPont. During our discussion, we had a productive conversation about SSO and MyAccess. Your presence and expertise helped address Mario's concerns and keep the launch on track! Your contribution has further developed a strong and meaningful partnership with DuPont. We greatly appreciate your invaluable support to the Launch team. Thank you again for your assistance!\n\n87#With Gratitude from GE HealthCare!|Rich, you are exceptional at what you do and not only do I appreciate it, so does GEHC!  This is a message of gratitude sent from Ellie & the GEHC team:  \"The GE HealthCare separation team has had a tremendous number of meetings these past few weeks, some being very last minute. Rich has made himself available on any given day or time to provide support. I am so grateful for his knowledge and expertise, but mostly his commitment to this team. I can speak on behalf of the team that we sincerely appreciate his continued transparency. It has allowed us to be realistic and prepare our deliverables appropriately to meet our timeline. He has been an amazing partner and so much fun to work with! Thank you Rich!!\"\n\n88#Fidelity in the win column - $6M|Well, this is just about the largest group of colleagues I have awarded recognition too.  But, this is what teamwork is all about...25 people strong (and the list is likely longer) won this opportunity together!!  It took everything we had to unseat BI and secure this new client and close to 80k new employees on the WH platform.    John McCormack - quarterback, leader, therapist and procurement whisperer.  Earned this deal...super work!!! Tom Libretto – met with CHRO onsite in final CHRO meeting and provided valuable guidance along the way! Hari Date – flew across country to attend final CRHO onsite meeting....huge thanks!! Grant Beckett – key IT/product leader in multiple onsite and virtual demo meetings....couldn't have won without you! Zoe Peterson Ward – met with Fidelity team as exec alignment during Fidelity WH visit...thanks Zoe!! Jen Reimert – early exec alignment with Suzanne Howard meeting.....great to have your expertise Jen! Tom Vitkofsky – WH Live lunch meeting with Cindy Silva and exec alignment with Suzanne Howard...provided consistent support at every stage....many thanks Tom!! Nuvs Jain – Tech demo / thought leader thru multiple demos /on-sites....thanks Nuvs!! Marcy Ricci – lead consultant throughout entire process.....always nice to win together Marcy...twice in a week!! Joyce Silvia – Attended on site meetings and several virtual meetings to share change management Hillary Mahoney – dozens of legal-to-legal negotiation sessions....probably can't say thank you enough. Kevin Heinzelman – product enhancement and e commerce leadership....has to support the products asks now : )  Others that contributed significantly as well....Julia Towle, Nick Solis, Chris O'Sullivan, Chuck Labovitz, Orlagh Lynch, Rich Sorrentino, Larry Dennison, Brian Moore, Kat Foley, Marissa Miller, Enda McKenna, Michael Robb, Jason Gori.  Amazing effort and another marquis financial services client!!  Enjoy!\n\n89#It's a small nuance|I wanted to acknowledge and thank you both for how you represented your teams in our two-day leadership offsite in your discussion areas. We strive to always be self reflective of our teams, to focus on how “we” can adjust and pivot to meet the business where it is at or where others are at. It’s a small nuance in presenting and it makes me proud of this leadership team on the tech side.\n\n90#Cheers to great backup support|On days like today I am grateful to have the support of such a strong team. The last two weeks have been busy with a client visit and time away to recharge. During this time, Shayna took charge of my current post launch projects that need help with data files, updating employee ID and making sure everything was moving along. Nick and Rich stepped up to help make my new launch feel welcomed while we received signed contracts and started documenting the short launch window. It was very reassuring that the team had my back with calls immediately when I got back to work. Thank you for being such a great team!\n\n91#James closes National Grid for $17,390,000|I have the privilege of working alongside James every day, and his success is no surprise. His work ethic, his hunger and can-do attitude, his dedication to getting better, his ability to build trust and credibility, his team approach and his capability of challenging in the most charming way are just some of the ways I see James shine.   James, I hope I say this enough to you – I think you are brilliant, and I feel privileged to work with you.   A stellar team is behind an outcome like this and there are many people to thank.   Michael Robb took the lead on crafting a powerful response to their monster  RFP and pulled in all the various SMEs for their expertise – Orlagh  dealt with NGs complex Infosec requirements, along with Mindi and Amanda who solved some  challenging YOS requirements,  Chuck took  the lead on our fee proposal and Catriona on some thought-provoking tax questions!   During our finalist presentation, NG shared that we were a ray of light after a day of other vendor presentations - Lynette, Weichen & Rich were outstanding, and they were helped by Lisa and Brian who created a powerful demo site.   The contracting process started in June and was led by Julia. She did an amazing job and once she had more important matters to focus on (a baby)  Hillary and Christie jumped in – they had the unusual situation of only ever being allowed to talk to Procurement, but regardless, the amount of effort they invested was incredible and they always found a solution. NG also insisted on us using their paperwork to which they were adverse to changing in any way  which made for some challenging conversations and a huge thanks to Tom L, Tom V, Nick and Chris for their  guidance, and the many meetings we all had to enable today to happen.   It takes a lot of effort from so many people to win a client of this magnitude, THANK YOU all!!   James – we are thrilled for you.\n\n92#Bas strikes again - Dorel signs for 300k|We are all sighing a big breath of relief that Dorel Juvenile are now clients. Sometimes, the value of the deal does not do justice to the work involved. This has been a true labor of love. Katie kicked off the sales cycle here, building great credibility and support for WH and got us to VOC in Q2 last year – well done Katie!!  However…..promptly afterwards, their business results took a nose dive and this was put “on hold” as they looked to bounce back.  Which they did in January 2023 when they told us they were prioritising recognition once more but also  looking at other vendors now. So we had to win it all over again which of course Bas expertly did.  But it was not done there. Bas then had to convince the different regions this was a good idea as well as their CEO and their CFO and the wider finance team. It felt never ending at times but Bas was resilient and engaging throughout and brought in amazing partners along the way. As ever, Naomi was a shining star delivering incredible value at every step, Nina provided them with practitioner advice appeasing any anxiety they had about doing this globally for the first time and Rich demonstrated that design and launch would be a breeze with his team by their side.   Finally, when it looked like it there was risk of signature coming in October vs September, Bas held very firm and got it signed less than 12 hours after the paperwork was sent. Beautiful sales execution Bas.   Needless to say, a huge amount of work went into this and we are confident the spend will grow as they see the impact that recognition has on their business, Congratulations to everyone involved.\n\n93#Gratitude for you all|Happy World Gratitude Day!  Amy, Jose, Danielle, Christa, Rich, Michelle & Judith. What a fantastic set of leaders you all are.  From leading your teams to working through issues to making sure all the pieces fit together for our customers, you are all wonderfully talented and driven.  I appreciate you every day (yes even weekends and holidays!) and am so grateful that I get to work with you.\n\n94#Thank you!|Rich, I wanted to take a moment to thank you not just for joining the Dorel call today and preparing our future customer for implementation but also for all the help you have offered over the last year. I mentioned in our call today that you are one of the most helpful people I have ever met, and that's very true. You're always responding with carefully drafted emails to all of my many questions and offering to join any calls where your expertise is needed. Your \"can do\" attitude is inspiring and much appreciated. Thank you!\n\n95#We Appreciate You|Rich, you were recognized during the Enterprise West Team meeting.  Thank you for taking time away from your day off to help answer several last minute questions provided as part of the US Bank RFP submission.  These questions required specificity and your expertise was needed.  The team had a quick turnaround to respond and you jumped right in to help get it done. Thank you for acting with urgency and allowing us to respond quickly.  We appreciate your support for this opportunity.  Thank you.\n\n96#Arkansas IT Expert|Rich, I appreciate you jumping on the IS/IT call today with Arkansas Children's.  They had quite the team of people on their end from SSO, to Workday to infrastructure and you handled every question they fired at you.  When one lady piped up with a concern you addressed it with a calm confidence that showed, we've been there, done that.  You're an awesome teammate to help bring deals across the finish line and get them started successfully!\n\n97#Asana Wizards|I would like to thank you both for taking time out of your busy schedules to explain Asana’s capabilities and help to create a project for customer onboarding to track launches.  Your expertise and willingness to share valuable information are greatly appreciated. It has been truly insightful and will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding and utilisation of Asana’s capabilities.\n\n98#Making a Special Olympian Very Happy|This should be a long written award, but with Rich as we all know about his work ethic, kindness and support of a fellow human is like no other. I work with Special Olympians, and currently working with an athlete to help him start playing the game of golf. Unfortunately, I was a bit worried when I wasn't able to find a set of golf clubs for this individual, which I knew could have repurcussions. I come into the office today, run into Rich (as I know he's a avid golfer), and asked if he had some clubs that he could donate. First words were \"heck yea!! I have a set of the Golden Bears\". Rich- not only will this be like Christmas morning for the Olympian, but you started off a great relationship in hopes he continues to have fun playing the game. There is no way that I can thank you enough for this real \"Human Moment That Matters\"!!   Michael\n\n99#DuPont closure.....finally|Team - Mike C was kind enough to send a spark to all the amazing humans for the great work in moving DuPont to the finish line, but I wanted to share my own note of appreciation to you all. Dan/Chuck/Julia/Hillary - you all put in some serious sweat and tears in iteration after iteration after iteration. We faced many challenges, some bizarre requests, and some we needed a little more negotiation along the way with. You continued to showcase value to DuPont and ensured we kept pace with our stance on what we could/couldn't do, thank you. John Trigg and Matt - can we have another call about Workday, can we have another request relating to how the integration works. I'm not sure how many individual/collective requests we had from the group, but you all delivered professionally and without hesitation, thank you. Allison - you started this one off, and joined us in every call, demo, and request, glad we were able to shy you away as much as possible from procurement :). Truly grateful for your amazing partnership to continue socializing and evangelizing what it means to work with us as a partner. Rich - you added amazing value just at the right time, when we thought this could have been derailed during multiple implementation calls, you kept calm, provided some great stories and really helped drive this one across the finish line. Marcy - you know how much I love working with you, and you are a class act in what you do. You helped craft an amazing business case story, were present for all of our demos to legal/procurement/hr team, and continued to stay close in how you could help. Tom V - thank you for driving executive-level leadership with two contacts when we really needed it. This one was hardly a walk in the park, but having Chris and Kathy readily available with your generous outreach, certainly showed our commitment to them, not to mention the multiple concessions we kept along the way.\n\n100#Bringing the SPARK into the Finalist Pitch|William, Michelle, Hari & Rich,  I wanted to send MAJOR gratitude for the support and teamwork you provided on the Guardian Finalist Presentation this week. It was a lot in a very short period of time and it all came together beautifully. Allll of the prep calls, figuring out how we can dazzle them with very vague guidance on the agenda, differentiating ourselves and working together to create a powerful presentation that stood out from the rest.  Hari, you presented on the WH IQ, case studies and Reach, Frequency & Value masterfully. In the demo when we needed to pivot, you did so seamlessly. You have a calm, cool way about you and it comes off professional even in a stressful environment.   Michelle, our fearless leader and executive sponsor. Way to kick off the call RIGHT. I love how you present in a clear, passionate way and sprinkle in challenger style questions along the way.   Rich & William, you were there to add context and support where needed and most of all to showcase what kind of humans they will be engaging with post launch. A critical aspect of this deal.   I really appreciate each of you for every role you played and I know the Guardian team was impressed as well 😊\n\n101#A Sparkly New Customer - Kohler $3M|Congratulations to Dawn O’Brien and her team on this exceptional achievement.  The hard work, dedication, and perseverance during this lengthy sales cycle has paid off.  Dawn led the ongoing work and successfully won this significant customer.  Thank you to the entire team for all your valuable contributions throughout the past 18 months.  If there was a selling step along the way to “check off,” this deal included it.  Two Workhuman Live events, pushed start dates, an onsite presentation in the middle of a snowstorm, a 2 hour plant tour, numerous dinners, demonstrations, business case preparation, a prioritization committee, a very controlling IT Team, a highly risk averse organization and a final approval process that required sign off from the CEO (whose last name is Kohler), were just a sampling of the key events required for this deal.  This is a new program build for Kohler and will initially include 25,000 global employees.    Kohler Company was founded in 1873 and is an American manufacturing company based in Kohler, Wisconsin. Kohler is best known for its plumbing products, but the company also manufactures furniture, cabinetry, tile, engines, and generators.  Kohler also owns several world class resorts including hotels and spas at St. Andrews Scotland.\n\n102#Pedro closes EDF|Congratulations Pedro on closing a 619k deal with EDF  and for your first of many deals with Workhuman.  When Sheri Ritter shared with us that a division of GE was being sold to EDF, she kindly introduced Pedro to key contacts there and helped ensure the transition was as smooth as possible.   Pedro did a wonderful  job building a strong relationship with Sylvie, VP of Rewards, so much so that not only did she attend our Paris dinner in May, she asked to meet Pedro for breakfast the next morning and they have had weekly calls since then.   Thanks to Sheri especially for transitioning this account and for being such a wonderful partner and to Rich,  Christie and Chuck for helping us to get this done   Pedro – I am THRILLED to see you close your first deal (and I know there is a lot more coming 😊) Your hard work and sharp focus on the French market is paying off and its thanks to you that our French pipeline is now tres healthy indeed.\n\n103#DuPont - Industrials Win $2M|Team, congrats on closing DuPont after a complex and lengthy sales cycle lasting over a year.  DuPont is a perfect fit for Workhuman with over 20k employees in a variety of industrial and manufacturing settings using Workday.  Think brands like Styrofoam, Kevlar and Tyvek; inclusive of spray paint....the list goes on.  DuPont struggled with finding budget for this program and securing internal approval, which created numerous starts and stops along the way.  Allison first got this deal started back in September of 2021, which resulted in dozens of meetings (many which proved pretty painful).  Marcy provided the expertise we needed to help DuPont build their internal business case and secure eventual funding.  Rich stepped in and helped when things went off the rails with some challenging questions around IT related internal costs.  Marcy's note in SFDC at one point says \"Rich crushed it\"!  Of course, Julia, Dan and Chuck supported sales and help to navigate a grouchy procurement person (who now loves us) and a highly disjointed internal process at DuPont.  Thank you!  Tom also stepped in from an executive alignment perspective with both the CHRO and VP of TR to help guide this to closure.  We earned every bit of this deal and firmly believe they will be a referenceable client for all of us to leverage!  And of course a special shout out to Mark for your leadership on this deal, your measured patience but also your ability to push when necessary.  Enjoy this one....DuPont Converse sneakers otw courtesy of Debbie!! I hope they match your Workhuman swag. LOL\n\n104#1H Ring the Gong|Thank you so much for this group for helping us to recognize our wins and milestones for the first half of 2023! I appreciate you taking the time to pull together sales wins, customer launches, renewals, and product innovations, along with the teams and individuals involved so we could celebrate and share with all across the company. Cheers!\n\n105#Jeld-Wen|Rich! Thanks so much for answering all my questions relating to Jeld-Wen! I also appreciate you taking the time out of your morning to locate a signed UAT for me too! Candidly speaking without your help, we would have short paid a commission! That said, thanks for going above and beyond by sending what I needed to complete my task! Much appreciated!\n\n106#Sincerest GRATITUDES to our FLEETCOR Launch Team!|AN ENOURMOUS THANK YOU to the entire team that supported FLEETCOR's Launch of GRATITUDES! FLEETCOR launched Strategic Recognition, YOS, and Celebrations Bundle to 9300 employees across 20 Counties and in 20 Languages.  This was a launch requiring flexibility and finesse!  Together we found creative solutions to each challenge that came our way, 8+ separate HRIS systems,  custom SOLI, looming company name change, vanity URL considerations, and much more.  Mary-Liz, your voice provided the calm guidance necessary to bring this launch to final.  Thank you for meeting the FLEETCOR communication and training teams where they were, pivoting when needed, and delivering trainings and resources that have been all met with positive feedback.  Matt Carlin, thank you for your hard work, thoughtfulness and patience on this FLEETCOR launch.  You navigated multiple SOLI and YOS catchup files, cookie attempts, and oh so many translations!  Rich, your 'behind the scenes' guidance and troves of launch experience were an absolute treat to absorb. Cliona and ihar, you are just fantastic - your skill and flexibility was critical as FLEETCOR requested multiple branding tweaks to their branding.  CL&S, thank you for the special Prod SSO support and coordination throughout this launch.  CONGRATULATIONS to the entire team who contributed to and supported this launch!\n\n107#Launch Day Support for Element and Corewell|I want to thank you all for the incredible efforts to support Element and Corewell on their launch day, July 18th. Ruchi and Brian, you both gave me the structure to put the customers in the best possible position to launch, as well as the framework to manage any unexpected issues. Luisa and Luka, you both hopped in early on launch day to support the push lives and to make sure the data files kicked off asap. Robert and Divya, you spent time during the late shift to make sure that our systems issues and remaining data file questions were addressed, keeping the launches on track. Divya, I also appreciate you keeping me up to date over the past couple weeks on the new branding for YOS awards. Rich, having a leader that is willing to support their team in difficult times on client calls is much appreciated. You being on with Corewell and addressing the challenges of the day with them buoyed their confidence to be able to launch. Thanks, everyone!\n\n108#Lead the way!|Rich thank you for pulling the team together for our quarterly check-in. I always feel so revived after our gatherings.  It gives me a change to connect with the larger team, learn what everyone is working on and you always think of ways to focus on our development.  Your commitment to making a fun and informative session does not go unnoticed! Appreciate you always leading the way to help keep the launch team awesome!\n\n109#HHMI Finalist Presenters|Michelle, Rich, Maggie and Dermot,  A MASSSIVE thanks to all of you for the preparation and time you spent the last couple weeks to support me on this deal 2 years in the making! Hard work + preparation pays off and we nailed the presentation. This was a 2 hour allotted time slot but we were able to cover A-Z in 90 minutes which was much appreciated by all going into the holiday weekend.  Michelle, the WH cloud overview and mobile demo was done flawlessly and we learned that their offline population was an important focus in the process.  Maggie, where do I begin? You stepped in to help with the right energy and \"let's do this!\" attitude and I cannot thank you enough. You covered so many different topics from the new WH IQ app, to customer stories and leading with data & industry insights as you knew this was a data driven company. You also covered all things customer success and launch which is such a critical differentiator.  Thank you for putting in the time to help get the right content in the slideware and offer feedback as to flow, what would be best for the customer, etc ---ALL during flight delays on a business trip.   Rich, when asked to cover integrations, you generously offered your time to walk through all the figma's and latest and greatest with Nuvs and I. We knew this was going to be a very important portion of the demo, and you delivered on every single aspect.   Dermot, wow. Just wow! Not only was it WAY after working hours but it was also after working hours on a Friday and yet, you would never know it by your energy and enthusiasm to play the critical role of security expert. I loved your onion analogy and light hearted jokes on a topic that otherwise may be a bit dry. Thank you for joining us and taking on that part!  Team, thank you for making sure the call was a success. I can't wait to see this one cross the finish line in 2023!\n\n110#To an incredible job well done!|WOW! What an incredible customer panel at WHL Regional forum in London!  It was an amazing endorsement of our platform, experience and results!  Both BP and Sanofi could not have been more positive and complimentary about Workhuman’s recognition program at each of their companies and it’s a testament to just how dedicated, professional and willing to go above and beyond each of you are to deliver this superior customer experience.  You just don’t hear this kind of resounding endorsement about other software vendors – in fact, Nathalie at BP even corrected herself from calling us a vendor, changing her word choice to partner!  So many of you were personally shouted out from the main stage and you all have had a critical role to play in making these customers true advocated and sponsors of Workhuman.  THANK YOU for all you do for BP, Sanofi and so many more of our key customers!!\n\n111#Brain Trust|This is long overdue as I wanted to thank each of you for your support you’ve provided me over the last little while, including last week. The support varies from crafting training materials, backend testing, demos, project support, managing customer responses and calls, validation on configuration/data files/my knowledge and escalation coverage. Your combined support has provided confidence in the support Workhuman is providing to our customers and continuing their trust in us. Thank you for allowing me to tap into this brain trust and I appreciate each of you!\n\n112#National Grid RFP Dream Team|A huge thank you to each of you for all the work you did to prepare for our presentation in Warwick. There were lots of emails flying around, multiple planning calls and of course the big pitch. Prior to all of that, Michael worked his magic to prime the Grid team and they were on tenterhooks to learn more. Lynette, a special mention to you for making the trek to Warwick, in between HR Congress panel presentations. This team delivered flawlessly and on the walk from their board room (I've never seen such an oversized board room table?!) to reception, Lucy confided in us that we were the last vendor they'd met with at the end of a very long day, as such, they were all hoping we would hold their interest and deliver an interesting presentation. She said that our presentation was not only 'very good', but that we'd definitely captured their full attention! It doesn't get much better than that - THANK YOU ALL!!\n\n113#Workday Help!|Thank you, Rich for sharing your expertise on the Workday integration. Our client requested an additional call and cooperation with their 3rd party technical partner. You did a fantastic job of reiterating the information you presented on the first call and catering your message to the audience on the call.   Thank you for the additional support!\n\n114#Another call with DuPont|Throughout the engagement with DuPont, they've never been shy about raising their hand and requesting a call with our team. This time, HR Tech Call to go through the WKDY, Launch, and other critical items. Thank you both for the prep work to ensure we were all on the same page and for the execution in Monday's call. A tough crowd initially, Dor and the team raised several questions but you both executed flawlessly AS ALWAYS. This will be a great client when we eventually get them signed :) We're getting close.....\n\n115#SME Jedi|Rich, our resident Workday (and so much more) Subject Matter Expert. Thank you for joining our call with DUPONT this afternoon to answer their questions about Workday, SSO and Payroll. I wrote down Prickly Dor's comment \"I don't need to feel comfortable with the team, I need to understand the integrations and infrastructure.\" and with that we were off to the races. You showed up calm and confident simplifying SSO and showcasing our Workday API integration, talking the team through a friction-less experience that includes leveraging WD payroll and Anytime Feedback. When they through you a curve-ball about using their field \"My Access ID\" you hit it out of the park with the \"xCustom Field\" You went on to share our scheduling process and SFTP to support global payroll requirements.   As the call went on, it felt as though you were earning some trust points with Dor she may have even let a smile slip (it sounded like a giggle on the phone since she never came on camera). You put us in a good place with a team that has been pridefully difficult - but rest assured the team YOU and yours will be working with are gracious and enthusiastic about this program.   I always learn something from time on calls with you, so thank you and I look forward to sharing more screen time with you on prospect calls that require our WD Jedi.\n\n116#Sysco's Workday Integration Roadmap|Rich! I wanted to take a moment to Thank You for hopping on a call I had scheduled around Workday integrations with Sysco. This client is EAGER to talk through our functionality and how far they can take their Workday integration with Workhuman. I appreciate your knowledge and time; the client was thrilled meet and to learn what next steps look like. Your follow up email providing visuals and clear paths forward was amazing. Teamwork makes the dream work, I appreciate you!\n\n117#Salesforce Master|Rich - thanks for taking time last week to run through the reporting functionality of Salesforce with me. Even prior to last week, you were one of my go-to people to figure out what sort of information was included in our CRM - exporting and sharing on demand so that my team and I could better understand the state of our client relationships. I may no longer need you to export on my behalf, but I sure did need a quick tutorial on how to self-serve. Thank you for sharing your tips and tricks with me last week and also for the collaboration over the last several months. You're a great cross-functional partner, Rich!\n\n118#Top Trainers|I wanted to thank you both for taking time to give the team training on SSO and Payroll files. The training may have been an hour but I know there is more involved in preparing for these sessions. And as we all know, there is plenty of other work as part of your roles that would be waiting for you after this. I know for me, both sessions were a great eye opener. Until now I would only be able to talk at a very general level for both of these topics but I now feel more confident to speak about these and having both sessions recorded I feel these will be invaluable resources for the team going forward\n\n119#To- Do- List ✔|This week has been extremely busy for all 3 of my clients!  I had many new items cross my desk for the first time and this team stepped up to share there expertise. Things like Crosswalks, Workday API Integrations, Birthday awards, and country specific years of service programs.  I have also recieved support with data file retrieval when my jump box wasn't working  and  new  data file review. Weeks like these I am so grateful for my team.\n\n120#Air Products Workday Project - Huge Success!|Rich, I can´t really put into words how appreciative I am for the work you did with the Air Products team on the Workday implementation. This project started last year and for many months you joined calls, troubleshooted, tested, and communicated effectively each and every step of the way. You made my life so much easier, while I focused on other elements, and you kept me very well informed throughout the project. The team was extremely happy with the result and praised you for being such a great partner. It was pleasure seeing you in action and I honestly look forward to working with you again soon!\n\n121#All around champion|Rich – you’ve had a lot thrown at you lately from strategizing for key sales calls, beautifully executing a technical call with GEHC, random Shared Services customer invites that in the end you were the best person for the call, mentoring your leaders to address employee and customer situations, to planning and collaborating with other leaders for the launch team offsite. Everything you tackle is done with thoughtfulness to represent the team and the company in the best light and to bring out the best in your people. I see you and all your efforts, Rich!\n\n122#Awesome Leaders|As we wrap up Employee Appreciation Day, I wanted to take a minute to thank this awesome team of leaders for your support.  While today’s events were a great an example of how you all come together to work around and through issues for our customers.  And you do this every day. You bring yourselves fully to ensure we are there for our customers and you all lead your teams with strength, professionalism, and humanity.  I appreciate you all every day and am honored to work with you.  Thanks.\n\n123#🏆🎓 #BigRocksBigResults - Class of Feb. 2023 🎓🏆|💡 “Be choosy about what you're choosing\".

Having those \"men behind the curtain\" during our Kohler presentation was priceless! Even though we had a large in-person presence at the Kohler Executive meeting, we all wanted to stay present in the moment, so we called on our all-around experts, Rich Sorrentino & Nick Eng to help us out.  We had a good group of Kohler executives in the room, but there were an additional 20+ who joined remotely.  Since we had a short window with a lot of material to cover, we suggested attendees submit questions via chat....and that they did!  Rich & Nick were busy in the background answering questions as we were soaring through our presentation.  Having experts addressing topics as they arose was perfect!  Everyone felt heard and valued, whether they were in the room or not.   Having those men behind the curtain was so helpful!  Thanks Rich & Nick for your support, sharing your knowledge, and making us look good!\n\n125#All things Salesforce from your perspective|On behalf of myself and Arann, just wanted to say thanks so much for your engagement and openness in all things Salesforce, as part of our Discovery exercise.  We got some fantastic nuggets of information from you and even more importantly, got to meet you all!  We really appreciate the time you gave us and look forward to meeting you all again in the future.\n\n126#A moment that mattered ❤ LSM|Leaving our team sessions yesterday, I felt inspired, supported, and proud to be part of the launch team. Thank you to this leadership team that put the event together and thinking through the whole day to even the smallest details (the dots). Judith and Rich there was great care in putting together an impactful agenda that seamlessly combine both Mid-Market and larger launches together. Amy the appreciation exercise was like nothing I have ever experiences and was extremely motivational! We do have an amazing team! Thank you!\n\n127#Launch Team '23 Offsite - Mission Accomplished|Rich, our Feb'23 Launch Team offsite was incredible. I know bringing in all the speakers for us was no easy task. The team is thinking more strategically and feeling empowered to get our customers to the finish-line. This isn't NASA but, mission accomplished. Thank you for including me and for saying that I add value to the team discussions despite not being on the Recognition side of the house. Eager to see how well we perform in 2023 at next year's offsite.\n\n128#A helping hand for QA'ing|Thank you Rich for jumping in for Amadeus' QA while I was away.  It is always helpful to keep processes moving while someone is out of the office and you were able to do so.  This now allows me to hit the ground running as I come back and close out this important milestone. Thank you!\n\n129#What a Wednesday!|Rich, I want to express gratitude and respect for how you consistently manage different scenarios, stakeholders, and situations on the launch team. We didn't interact all day today, but this Wednesday was a great example of how you're often relied on by our team and pulled in different directions so that you have to wear different hats. Early in the day, I sought feedback on how I managed Billings Clinic's budget challenges with my team, and you provided concrete next steps on how Jen and I should involve Cam. You also hosted a team-wide workshop and continued the practice of engaging every person on the call and soliciting their feedback while creating real-time progress for our team. We also touched-base around performance and growth opportunities for my team members, where we had constructive conversations around what needs to happen for their development. A little bit ago we got off the Kohler finalist prep call with Rahul, where you sharing your experiences and recommendations for handling these types of meetings have gone a long way with building Rahul's and my confidence. I'm sure your days are often like this, but today stood out to me as we interacted in different ways and you always bring your best for the team. Thank you!\n\n130#Budgeting Bosses|Rich, Matt, and Erin, thank you all for the help in crafting some budget/spend management options for Sanofi. This client has come into launch with some fears around spend and budgeting, and expressed a strong desire for partnership from Workhuman during the Design Lab. You've all jumped in to help me meet this request, spending time talking through different pros, cons, and options, as well as the best way to handle some of the objections that we anticipate will arise. I appreciate the teamwork on this!\n\n131#A perfect way to end 2022!|Team - thank you all for your support, guidance and patience as we navigated the sometimes choppy waters of the Sanofi recognition RFP. From demonstrating how recognition can support Sanofi's Olympic partnership, an impromptu request to visit Sanofi HQ or a last minute change in legal resource, this one really had it all!   The process required a truly collaborative spirit and you all at some point produced work of the highest quality, often at very short notice. One of the key considerations for Sanofi throughout the selection process was that they were looking for a partner and the feedback we've had was that we demonstrated our commitment to this at each and every stage.  We have a wonderful opportunity to grow this relationship and I am incredibly grateful for the role that each and every one of you played in bringing this fantastic client onboard - and beating the buzzer right at the end of 2022!   Thank you all!\n\n132#Partnerships through 2022|Thank you all for your support and partnerships throughout the year. We have worked together on various projects, issues and tasks such as prioritisation, weekly check-ins, customer projects, RCA learnings etc, all with the goal of continuous improvement and customer support in mind. Thanks again and I look forward to working with you all again in the coming year.\n\n133#Flutter dream team!|A massive thank you to each and every one of you! Winning Flutter's business was a true team effort and the starting point was Anna, taking the lead on our RFP response. You clearly produced a powerful proposal Anna, as the Head of Reward told me that it was evident we were the best fit for their requirements based on our response. Very nicely done indeed!...Orlagh, Rich and Dan, you all dealt with some extremely challenging requirements around multiple programme capabilities and data security/access, but again, Vlad at Flutter was seriously impressed by what he saw, both in terms of what you created in the branded demo, as well as addressing their constant flow of detailed technical programme design & security questions. And Christie, your deep knowledge meant that we were always on the front foot and you were able to lead Flutter's legal team to exactly where we wanted them to be and within the timelines we'd stipulated. Thank you all!!\n\n134#Great leaders in 2022|Rich, Amy, Jose, Danielle, Cam, Michelle, Christa, Judith you are fantastic leaders for the team.  On today’s all hands’ call you highlighted the successes of your team members and many of them provided quotes that we added to the attached video (thank you Amanda Salvas!).    You all bring such drive, compassion, knowledge and strategy to our customers and teams’ needs.  You bring your whole selves to the work at hand and ensure your teams have the opportunity to thrive.  As you can see from their comments, they appreciate you all (as do I).  Thank you for all for everything you’ve done in 2022 and I’m looking forward to continued success in 2023.\n\n135#My incredible leadership team|In today’s All Hands meeting, you all spoke about the incredible accomplishments each of your team’s have accomplished. I wanted to take a moment for you. Your biggest accomplishment as a leader goes beyond the customer work. That's expected to jump in on an escalation and problem solve for customer satisfaction. The accomplishment I want to highlight are the type of leaders you are for your teams. Rich, Michelle and Judith - you support each person on your respective team, listening, coaching and encouraging them to be their best. If you have a team that feels at their best, that carries over into the amazing customer work they do. Couple that with your courage, passion, confidence and ambition to keep pushing yourself and us forward. The teams of Launch, Technical Services and Mid-Market absolutely crushed it this year under your leadership. Thank you for all you do!\n\n136#On the Money!|Rich, Awesome teamwork on the Goldman Sachs meeting today! It was efficient, on point and exactly what they were looking for. There is no question it moved the needle on a decision. I can't thank you enough for the teamwork!\n\n137#First Graduating Class of Spark Director+ !|Congratulations to our pilot class of Spark Director+, Workhuman's first-ever leadership development program catered specifically to our Director and Senior Director population! These 40 graduates completed a journey of self reflection, upward feedback, and personalized learning across 7 course offerings: Strategic Planning, Delegation & Empowerment, Emotional Intelligence, Cultivating Resilience, Leading Hybrid Teams, Psychological Safety, and Change Management. Thank you, graduates, for investing time in your own development!\n\n138#ethanks only demo|Rich, you are continually looking at ways to improve the launch process from multiple angles. Your latest suggestion of creating an ethanks only site is just brilliant. As we are seeing the trend of ethanks only programs for new customers, you paused to think about what that experience would be for those customers during the launch process. Our existing demos contain monetary value which can cause confusion and unnecessary extra noise. You took the initiative to have a new demo created and the first time used for Upper Canada District School Board was a raving success. They really appreciated the extra effort, as they called out that previous demos were distracting. A moment of reflection is going to be a game changer for so many of our team and for our customers. Fantastic job!\n\n139#✨ Spark Director+  [Psychological Safety] ✨|💡 \" Psychological Safety is a shared belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.” – Amy Edmondson.     📊 In 2012, Google embarked on a quest to build the Perfect Team. An initiative code-named Project Aristotle studied hundreds of Google’s teams to better understand why some stumbled, whilst others soared. Google’s extensive research corroborated the importance of Amy Edmondson's coined phrase, discovering that Psychological Safety is a paramount component of High Performing Teams.   ⚠️ Building a fearless organization that truly embraces psychological safety will leverage the benefits of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), attracting and retaining a diverse environment of talented individuals, in addition to promoting innovation, connection, and a sense of belonging (DEIB).   🚀 Spark Director+ is a self-discovery journey within an overarching Leadership Learning Track, offered to Directors and Senior Directors who manage teams of all sizes.   📢 Please join me in applauding our enthusiastic Workhuman Executive Leaders who participated in this month’s Psychological Safety module: Adam, Amy, Andrew, Colleen, Jason, Jeff, Laura, Linda, Martina, Michelle Drozdowski, Michelle Lane, Michelle McDaid, Niall, Rich, Tyler, Varun, and Zhennaa, thank you for your valued partnership as Psychological Safety Ambassadors.

The Ochsner PM said that it felt that Christmas Eve the on the Eve of their Ovations Launch to their 32,000 caregivers and employees that help change and save lives every day.

Congratulations!\n\n141#Taking Steps Forward at TD Bank!!|Team, thanks to each of you for stepping up to deliver a very successful call yesterday at TD Bank.  BOI and our financial model can be challenging to convey, especially when we have a customer using a very different model with Tanner.  We had the right team and delivered a strong message for change.  A special shout out to Rich for stepping up last minute to support the call and provide much needed credibility and experience.  Thank you!  Now on to the demo in two weeks!!\n\n142#Post Launch Survey Re-imagined|Thank you to this team for re-imagining the Post Launch Survey for Corporate/Enterprise and in the same process, we have also introduced the PLS for MidMarket! The expertise from the Customer Experience/Data Insights team allowed us to evolve our question curation to maximize impact. Added on top of that our new tool, Qualtrics, for greater flexibility for conditional questioning – targeting survey recipients to ask questions specific to the role they played. The trickiest part was our testing of the SFDC integration to automate the process for efficiency. I appreciate each of you as we worked through this process, testing and more testing for a successful outcome! I’m so excited to have this live.\n\n143#Customer Marketing Trivia Winners|Thank you all for being active readers and for responding with the correct answer to this week's trivia question!!\n\n144#Halloween Costume Winners!!!!!|Congrats on 2022 Halloween Costume Winners in the Most Creative - Laura Funniest- Meghan Scariest- Rich Best Duo- Snooki & Dena!!!!

There was WAY more to do than I had anticipated, and I definitely needed the assist! I very much appreciated everything you helped with!\n\n146#Design Lab Watch Party|THANK YOU for such an interesting and engaging training today. Having the Slack channel to ask questions and get your proactive context throughout made it all come together. This was a really important perspective for the corp comm and customer marketing teams to see. Being able to connect with launch managers moving forward will add so much value to how we plan our marketing and communications, and hopefully in turn help for an even better launch process!\n\n147#New CC Service content - check!|Thank you to this incredible team for helping our new expanded Service Milestones content come to life on Customer Central! Morgan and Olivia, thank you for pushing this project through from beginning to end, drafting content, hunting down resources, keeping reviews on track, and overall project management. Melanie, thank you for your guidance on this project. You kept us focused on the right pieces of the puzzle and were always available to answer questions along the way. Brenda, Joyce, and Rich, we couldn't have put this content together without your subject matter expertise! Thank you for being there to answer all of our questions, provide feedback, and review content. Kelsey and Luke, thank you for the finishing touches of creating the graphics and site pages that will bring this content to life. It's always a pleasure to work with this team of amazing collaborators !\n\n148#Celebrating Bravery & Unfiltered Feedback|Launch team, I wanted to thank you all for your courage and authenticity during our recent round of project management process interviews, in preparation for the upcoming Asana rollout. Having dedicated time to talk through each of your feelings and ideas for the next generation of launch individually was such a gift. While it may have felt uncomfortable for some, the feedback from every single person was unique and valuable. You all understood the assignment and came ready with fantastic insights. My hope is that at the end of this month, you each see yourself reflected in the initial Asana rollout; it wouldn't have happened without you!\n\n149#ATS YES!|Team, congrats on a very satisfying win at ATS!!  This is another key Canadian client acquisition, that was certainly no easy task.  This account opportunity was opened back in 2019 and then spent over a year in prove and contract stages.  Without rehashing all of the intricacies, they deal required a tremendous amount of grit, determination, creativity and perseverance.   It also required the best of our team and a broad group of contributors.  Ankur, a special congrats to you as the deal quarterback.  This was also your first win, so an extra special milestone for you!  Your ability to build strong relationships with the ATS team all the way up to the CHRO was essential.  Rob, your relationship with Stephanie in the account was also key, as was your continuous engagement in the sales process.  I think you shared that this deal holds the record for the most SA meetings of all time....WOW.  Maggie and Erin, you contributed to this lofty record and your expertise is always much appreciated.  Rich, thanks for stepping in to offer launch guidance and Orlagh, thanks for getting the entire team comfortable with our security processes.  In the end, Christie you led the charge on contracts with some support from Julia and Joe (Joe put this through DocuSign 5 or 6 times).  Again, this was a journey and required a true team effort.  Thanks to everyone involved.  Enjoy this win!\n\n150#Time to fly a kite|Thank you, Nick, Shayna, and Rich, for supporting my clients so I could have some much-needed rest and time off with my family. Time to fly a kite and go on adventures with my family. Having a team that can pick up and run with all the items juggling at any one time during a launch is amazing and then quickly get me right back in the mix is so important and allowed me to truly unplug. Thank you!\n\n151#Piloting us to success!|When an urgent request came through from Sanofi to share guidance around a potential pilot phase,  I knew exactly who to turn to! As ever, this amazing group of humans came together at very short notice to create a document of outstanding quality. I'm confident that this will further demonstrate our commitment to being a true partner to Sanofi at a critical time in the process. Thank you all!\n\n152#It takes a village|The Recognition Welcome Series is officially up and running, and you all played a major role in making that happen. Caoimhe & Miriam, amazing job designing the emails – they are works of art. Allyson & Chris, phenomenal work building the email templates and managing the translations. Jessica, great job jumping right in and building out the workflow to ensure the right people are receiving the right messages. Pearse, Yohana, Liam, Phil, Martina, Kamal, Sagar, Stephen, Thiago, Dag, Wes, Natallia, Yury, Noreen – thank you for your combined efforts in supporting Minerva to get the data synced in Customer.io so we would have the ability to email the users. Alan, thank you for keeping us organized and on track and for setting up a detailed dashboard to monitor engagement. Brenda and Rich, thank you for taking the time to support Human Engagement in this effort to reach and support our end-users right from the start. Susan and Kevin, thank you for supporting this initiative and getting the right people together to accomplish this huge win. It’s just the beginning!\n\n153#Supporting us in an instant|Thank you, Rich and Nick, for coming in to support Jen and me at a pivotal moment on Benjamin Moore's UAT day. When we had custom configuration challenging us with errors the morning of, you both jumped into action, aligned the team, and within an hour, we had a resolution. Your knowledge of other customers' configuration gave us such helpful context for BMC's challenging design element and knowing what the right path was to take, so thank you for being there when we needed you!\n\n154#Grateful to be part of an amazing team|What an amazing group of humans that I am grateful to call my team! Over the last few months, I have been challenged in new ways personally and professionally. This group without missing a beat has been there to support me as a whole human. Helping my clients move forward, being a friendly ear or answering an SOS for help through Slack. In my career, I have never worked on a team that had each other’s back as much as this group of humans. Thank you and Go Launch!\n\n155#Learning Award support|Rich, thank you so much for taking the time and chatting to me about your experiences with Spark Leadership. You provided some fantastic insights and were such a pleasure to work with. I look forward to sharing your experiences in our award submission!\n\n156#Helping me keep calm and get unstuck!|Rich, I can't let World Gratitude Day pass by without thanking you for helping me \"get unstuck.\" I have had so many questions while working on the Cisco account and you have quickly and with a pleasant attitude provided the answers I need. I won't forget our conversation last week where you said you enjoy helping people get unstuck. There are many times when I have been \"stuck\" waiting on answers. It's a terrible feeling. When you quickly come along with an answer and show me how to find the resource, I am able to knowledgably and confidently help our client. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n157#Leaders who Get Stuff Done!|On this World Gratitude Day, I want to this fantastic group of leaders to know how much you are appreciated and how much impact you have for the team, our customers, and our business. You lead team members, you work through issues, you guide and coach, you recruit talented humans, you motivate customers and make sure that customers’ voices are heard by the rest of the company.  Thank you for being you, bringing your talent every day, and getting “stuff” done.  With gratitude....\n\n158#Early Decision Guidance Guru|Rich - Thank you for being such a great partner on the Early Decision Guidance calls we’ve had with Patterson and Digital Realty. Both organizations need to implement quickly and you’ve helped them start thinking about some of the key decisions that need to be made to speed up the process. I really appreciate how you are always willing to join calls to make prospects feel at ease about the implementation process and I know I can always count on you to help answer specific questions they have. Thanks again for all the support!\n\n159#Launch and CL&S Meet and Greet|We have many new faces on the Launch side and on the CL&S side. We interact on tickets and calls so it was wonderful to put faces to names and get to know each other a little more. Fun facts we learned include our love of cats and dogs, painting miniature figurines, a drummer in a band, basketball coach, love of travel, sharing childhood video games with your son, amateur photographer, bartender extraordinaire, previous life in the TV world, hitting every baseball stadium, getting married at a living history museum, meeting your spouse at work and speaking Arabic, but we will still be after you Stephen for the fun fact that will only be shared over drinks. We look forward to our work together and continuing to meet the rest of our team members!\n\n160#Flutter-ing Fantastic|What an innovative meeting today with Flutter! They brought very specific criteria to this team, asking for a number of scenarios, including various recognition schemes broken out by geo, group, brand, etc. Dan, you did great work building a custom demo that showed how each of their workflows and sub groups would operate in detail. I've never seen this capability before! James, you took the custom setup and offered careful navigation throughout, so that the Flutter team could track each one of the activities. You'd never know it wasn't something you speak to every day! Rich, your explanation of the behind-the-scenes structure and operational elements was the final touch - you inspired trust and confidence in our capabilities to build and support a Flutter program to suit their needs. In the spirit of gaming, I'm betting on this one!\n\n161#Crushing it with Cisco|Rich, thank you SO much for all your tremendous work on the Cisco launch. I don't even know where to begin. Today for example, the Cisco PM team was literally bowing down to you in gratitude for helping them set up all their spend management accounts while they were out of the office yesterday. And you had already done this for their other program earlier in the month! Agreeing to do that was above and beyond, and they absolutely LOVE you. In addition to managing this crazy launch for the past few months and dealing with weekly turned daily meetings, you've also been fully immersed in the post-launch hyper care stage. You've advised them on how to fix their non-working, convoluted approval rules, dealt with Service Milestones wbau formatting issues, and have been a consistent presence in helping them manage the day-to-day in this transitional period. Thank you for your incredible partnership - Cisco and I will forever be grateful!\n\n162#Celebrate for the Diageo launch!|Thank you team for your support throughout the launch of the Celebrate program at Diageo!  Each of you played a critical role prior, during and now post launch of the program.  The team remained confident and positive that we would deliver a program that would reach all their employees and represent Diageo in the best light.  The feedback from Tracey and John has been great to see with Tracey even receiving a post it note from a colleague during our call about the Celebrate program which makes these launches all worth it!  You stepped out of your boxes to deliver a best in class program.  Thank you all and can't wait for the next launch with this team!\n\n163#Many heads make light work!|Thank you all for the knowledge sharing and solution driven approach to finding a new, and better way, for us to be successful in fulfilling customer requests. The YOS programme is a significant award in an employees tenure so being better able to fulfil those one off requests faster enhances that experience. Really great to see the cross departmental collaboration.\n\n164#Celebrating Cisco!!|So much magic happening at Cisco and such a spectacular and successful launch of their new platform today!!  Amazing accomplishment with a tremendous amount of teamwork and just plain, old, hard work from everyone on this core team.  Rich, your guidance through this launch has been spectacular.  Leading the way with your knowledge and suggestions is what made all of this happen.  It was an immense amount of work that all paid off with a successful launch this morning!!  Thank you!  Matt, I have never seen someone step into such a massive project and so seamlessly pick up and carry the ball for Rich during his vacation.  I held my breath as we slipped you in for that week and could actually exhale immediately.  Thank you!  Corinne and Jessica.  Awe inspiring!  Simply put, your suggestions, input, materials and development of materials have not only led to such a great launch but will continue to bring more and more attention to the new platform and all the additional solutions Cisco will now have at their finger tips.  Thank you!  Leslie, thanks for stepping in on this launch and keeping the home fires burning while I was out.  Who could ask for a better boss and friend?  You are a true gem.  Thank you!  Last, but certainly not least, to a wonderful CSM who jumped on this account 3 years ago.  We've seen a lot of leaders come and go here and still Claire has gone with the flow.  Cisco, in the past couple of years has added merch to their platform, developed a true peer to peer interaction, added Life Events and Service Milestones and is currently looking at Conversations!  Claire has been right there for this entir Cisco journey.  Thank you to my partner in crime.  Couldn't do it without you! Cisco's team has expressed such true gratitude for their experience in this launch and who can blame them?  This was an \"A\" team delivering excellence at every turn and relationships with the Cisco team that will go a very long way into the future.  Congrats!!\n\n165#Coming through in the Clutch|Rich and Tim, this expression came to mind as I was I thinking about your recent involvement in ATD. I think of clutches as purses, but apparently it's also a car part which is my tenuous tie to ATD and their car-related industry. But seriously, I'm thinking of you both more as team players that make the best plays even when the pressure is high! Rich - you've been a great leader as we navigated the bumpy road with ATD. I think of the time and special conversations you had with them on things like easing them away from their legacy competitor, the accommodations you made to help facilitate this through things like the Celebrations images, and of course, the last-minute 7am call on the day of our Summer Event to deliver the hard news that they can't always get it their way (earthshaking program changes days within launch, that is). They didn't like our answer but you had them acknowledging our partnership and the fact that our advice is guided by a true best interest is the best experience for their associates. Tim, despite coming in at the tail-end of the launch, you got up to speed quickly on the account and were standing shoulder-to-shoulder with us. Did I mention the 7am call? I was impressed by the amount of time you took to understand them and the history with the account, and the determination to ensure we remain aligned and balanced moving forward. We will tread carefully but I'm hopeful that the rubber will truly meet the road and they will see the advantages of our recognition philosophy.\n\n166#SMTP to AWS migration|The last few weeks saw the culmination of many months of work with the completion of the migration of all client SMTP/email delivery services to AWS from our last physical data centre. This took a momentous amount of planning and coordination between multiple internal WH teams both Cloud and Client Services and then with our clients themselves. The level of cooperation displayed between all teams ensured, most importantly the uninterrupted delivery of client email which number in the 100s of thousand per day and ultimately the successful delivery of the project and is no small feat. Our new AWS home will allow us to take full advantage of all that AWS has to offer providing a stable and robust platform to build and grow our product upon. Well done to all involved and enjoy your reward!\n\n167#Customer Central Content Addition|Rich, thank you for your recent suggestion to add a new piece of content to Customer Central. We're still pretty early in our launch and we're always looking for ways to improve the end-user experience. You passed along a list of URLs and IP addresses that launching customers should share with their IT teams, and we were able to integrate it with one of our client guides and call it out in one of our onboarding modules. The guide will help customers launch more seamlessly. Thank you again for your suggestion, and for helping us improve the quality of the content on Customer Central!\n\n168#Now That's what I Call Feedback|Rich, we often talk about timely recognition with our customers, so I NEED to submit this right after we chatted this evening. Thank you for spending time to coach me through some heavier launch process topics, and how I can take a step back and look at things in different ways. Your perspective around what is difficult, how we can improve, and where we are going as a business was just what I needed to hear after a long 24 hours. Thank you!\n\n169#New Beginnings|Rich, I wanted to thank you for your coaching and guidance you have given me over the last year. From the moment I started at Workhuman you made me feel welcomed, valued and part of the team. The Launch team has benefited from your leadership in advocating for the team, improving process and helping us to continue to grow. Excited for you to continue to grow in your new role and help shape what the future of the launch team will look like. Looking forward to the next chapter. Thank you!\n\n170#Celebrating Organon's 1st Anniversary|Thank you all for your participation in making Organon's 1st year celebration a moment that matters! Amanda, I don't know what I would do without you and your amazing, creative mind. Not only for this effort but I threw a lot at you (at the same time!) around care packages, thank-you gifts after Workhuman Live etc., and you produced multiple great ideas AND took care of all of the heavy lifting for me. I want you to know that I appreciate YOU so much.  Thank you to this whole team for your contribution in the video to celebrate this special anniversary of the original Inspire program & now Talk.Recognize.Reward.! You are all awesome humans!!\n\n171#Launch Success Training Enthusiast!|Many thanks, Rich for sharing your time, knowledge and passion for our new hire Launch Success training this week!  I appreciate your insights on how CSMs and LSMs can effectively partner together on our shared mission.  Having worked in Professional Services for a number of years, I appreciate the work of your team to ensure new clients have a winning implementation experience.   The best practices you shared will be helpful as I continue to get up to speed and am assigned my BOB.   I look forward to working closely together and again, thank you for your top notch training!\n\n172#Detective Badge|Rich, thank you so much for all your help in reviewing the questions Lincoln had on the YOS catch up awards. Your keen attention to detail help put the puzzle pieces together and provide a quick remedy to our customer.  You have certainly earned a Detective Badge today!\n\n173#Setting the Stage Like a Pro|To our amazing group of humans who took the stage to announce each WHL breakout speaker - BRAVO!!! This role required poise, prep, guts (especially for anyone not used to big audience public speaking), and energy - engaging the audience and setting the stage for the speaker talent. No small feat! Amy kicked us off by introducing Priya Parker on Monday afternoon and when her heel stuck in the stage floor, she handled it like the pro that she is and showed us all \"how it's done\" with grace and humanity. Everyone truly stepped up (yes, pun intended) for last-minute fill-ins when needed, seizing new opportunities and rising to the occasion. Thank you all for your collaboration and flexibility, and for truly making the breakout experience so phenomenal!\n\n174#Scanning to infinity and beyond!|To my amazing WHL scanning family - it takes a village and I am grateful for all of you! Not only did you show up literally, but you all showed up figuratively - when faced with various challenges. You kept the masses calm, came up with creative ways to keep the lines moving, smiled when the app/device/internet decided to take a break - you name it, you NAILED it! When we realized we needed more scanners for max capacity sessions, you answered the frenzied (ok yes, desperate) call for help! You were my Buzz Lightyears, (especially when I had that same look Woody has on his face in this picture) swooping in with a \"we got this\" attitude and a smile. While this \"job\" at WHL might have seemed mundane and thankless, it was actually mission-critical to the success of a large portion of the overall event and YOU are the reason we conquered! Thanks to each and every one of you for being the amazing teammates that you are!\n\n175#Thank you!|Thank you all for all the support and help over the past few months to ensure that the WH Live breakout session went as smoothly as possible. Kellye for coming up with the original idea and for reviewing the slides multiple times. Kevin for all the help, support and guidance on what needed to be covered. Sophia & Chris for being the best support team there is. Everything from multiple check ins to on the day support. Rich for a fantastic introduction on the day and also running the mics with Jess during the event for Q&A. Thank you all!\n\n176#Sharing Customer Stories|Folks, Thanks for spending the time presenting to the Customer Success All-Hands meeting yesterday and sharing customer stories.  Rich, thanks for sharing details on the Pfizer launch and how you and Matt managed a tight deployment and launched a huge program in record time was exciting (in addition to your Launch update! ).  Guil, you story of creating a Recognition Summit for Air Products reinforced that we can leverage strategic approaches to inspire our growth customers.  Melissa, diving into the use of the API for PepsiCo and the example of including recognition into their company newsfeed was powerful and sparked peoples ideas.  Noah, it was great to see the breadth and depth of work being performed for Accenture.  Steve you rounded out the stories with a truly human moment from Accenture.\n\n177#Jumping in for Pfizer|Thank you for jumping into the Pfizer cancellation request today. They deemed a significant amount of awards to be fraud and had high expectations WH could resolve in the same day. You pulled in the necessary people to support this effort and demonstrated to the customer WH’s commitment to their needs while supporting the time our team needed to execute. Your continued updates reinforced our partnership with Pfizer and they were very pleased we were able to accomplish this today for them. Thank you for your leadership!\n\n178#Every last detail- Lincoln Launched|Thank you so much to this group of outstanding humans that helped Lincoln get to this day! Over the last few months this Launch has required expertise from all parts of the business to fully understand every decision, assist with best practices and willing to adjust the strategy as needed.  All your hard work has paid off with a happy customer and over 11,000 moments created yesterday (between Launch day award, ShoutOut, Life events, Service Milestones and Community events). Appreciate everyone effort to get this one to the Launch finish line!\n\n179#Customer onboarding experts to the rescue!|Rich, Brenda, and Melanie - I want to thank you each for your expert guidance and support as we developed the new Customer Onboarding track in Customer Central. Your invaluable insight into the detailed and nuanced customer launch process made this track happen! From brainstorming what format would make this content most valuable, to providing and reviewing content, to answering my millions of questions - all in a very timely manner, might I add! - this couldn't have come together without each of you. I'm so proud of what we built in such a short time, and I look forward to working with all of you in the coming months to make it even better!\n\n180#Teamwork Central|I wanted to take the time to thank all of you for your hard work and dedication over these past few months as we’ve worked toward this massive expansion of our old Customer Center and ultimately unveiling the new Customer Central to all customers. You were all integral in this project, and I cannot thank you enough. Whether you were developing the content, creating the massive number of images throughout the site, mapping the site layout, reviewing on a daily basis, integrating our access codes in Salesforce, assisting in a complete URL update, coordinating a massive email campaign, or helping me with one of my million requests, this was truly a team effort. Hopefully you can all take a moment to reflect on what a massive accomplishment this is. Thank you all again!\n\n181#BioMarin Brigade|Now that BioMarin has officially launched wanted to thank the BioMarin Brigade for their support in getting us to this day. There have been many emails, meetings, Jira tickets and Slack conversation that were essential to meet BioMarin where they were and create a plan that will bring the cultural change they are looking for. Appreciate everyone's partnership, time, and dedication to our customer! Great work!\n\n182#Delivering Results|In the past two weeks, Rich has supported me through Organon escalations and now password configurations for Morgan Olsen. This morning, I shared with him the issues WH was encountering prior to hosting their  UAT call with Morgan Olsen. He instantly connect with the psupport team and gave me a temporary solution to share with the MO PM. It's 1:30 PM and the issue is now resolved.  Rich is someone who consistently shares time, experience, and support with colleagues to ensure WH delivers results to customers. Thank you, Rich!\n\n183#Thank you for the support on my first week!|Thank you all for being a part of my first week with the Launch team! The warm welcomes, helpful information, talks about what we do at Workhuman and our values and mission, answers to random questions, small talk, and having someone to sit with at the office have added up to a great onboarding experience. It makes me excited for the weeks to come, so thank you for such a great start!\n\n184#Merck Payroll File Consolidation|Rich, thank you for leading the project to consolidate all 80+ country payroll files at Merck down to 2 files.  Back in August, Merck's IT lead reached directly out to you with this ask and you just ran with it from start to finish (who am I to get in the way of that?).  This process involved a number of meetings with Merck as well as a very early testing schedule.  I really appreciate you stepping up and taking this over as well as keeping me informed of any configuration or schedule changes that took place.  It's always reassuring knowing that you're involved and it was a huge help for me.  I'll make sure that the Merck IT team keeps your contact information on speed dial.\n\n185#King Collaborator|Rich, I want to thank you for your collaboration and teamwork over the last few months. You are extremely busy but have made the time to collaborate with me, brainstorm, and directly support some of the customer projects we have underway. I appreciate your patience with my 'newness' to some of the processes and \"having my six\". I appreciate your feedback and support! I look forward to the continuous improvement and collaboration with you and learning from you. :-)\n\n186#Team Prudential moved mountains for the win!|I always tell our prospective clients that WH will bring a SWAT Team of SMEs to ensure their success pre- and post-sale; I'd say this list proves this. Look at all the parts of the company involved: marketing, branding, RFP, sales enablement, customer success, launch success, product, engineering, legal, finance, ecomm, customer service, WHiQ, strategic advisory, strategy & consulting, operations, IT/security, sales, sales leadership. A special thank you to Marcy for once again being my go-to for all things, Mike for being my collaborator and trusting me to make or have a high degree of influence on key decisions and inflection points in the deal, Nuvs for his support in his new role as a liaison to sales - you are going to be busy for a very long time my friend, Naomi for helping me build trust early on with our program owner,  Mr. SMEchmitter for helping us drive the Value at different key points in the journey, to Mr. O'Sullivan for being our toughest sale (I kid, I kid), but in the end one of our greatest collaborators, Meisha-Ann for being our People Analytics assassin in and out, but killing the competition with our biggest differentiator, Mr. Robb and Orlagh for yet another heavy IT due diligence process.  This is a significant accomplishment, but I'm confident we will have just as many or more WH people building off of your efforts to ensure Prudential realizes the highest peaks of success on behalf of their employees with WH as their partner and the WH Cloud as an enabler. THANK YOU for your contributions to this momentous Workhuman win!\n\n187#Tricks of the trade|Rich, this week has been a crazy week of first for me going through my first 3 launches. During the week you have helped me with many different items including a tool to help configure award details for a workday, formatting my first workday data file and ways to make excel work faster.  I appreciate a leader who is not afraid to roll their sleeves up and help the team be successful. Appreciate all your help!\n\n188#Leading Launch from the Front|I wanted to call out what an absolute stellar job you did crafting this year’s Launch Success Offsite. Your theme was perfectly weaved throughout the day with our team discussions and with our multiple guest speakers. Your preparation with each speaker made for engaging, thoughtful and productive collaboration across the team. We had many laughs, aha moments, fun catch phrases and more emotional intelligent tools to add to the team’s tool kit. And speaking of one of the catch phrases of the day, everyone would agree I couldn’t send this recognition without a picture of a snake eating a gazelle. Your leadership is an inspiration to us all. Truly wonderful job on this designing, organizing and executing this Offsite!\n\n189#Keeping Everyone Included!|Rich, I wanted to say a big thank you to you for making sure that I was included in today's LSM offsite. I know that you went out of your way to make sure to schedule the event before my departure from Workhuman. You could have delayed a week and saved a little money, but you didn't! It made me feel very valued to know that you wanted me to be involved. I was happy to be able to participate in the meeting, as well as socialize with the full LSM team for the first time.\n\n190#A 'Toast' For Toast!|Team; thank you all for collaborating on so many unique, challenging opportunities with Southern Glazer's to achieve such a successful launch! In our final launch checkpoint, the client shared their appreciation of the project team's relationship and shared goals - beginning with Workhuman sales process, throughout discussions on commemorative anniversary requirements, and culminating with a campaign to deliver hundreds of initial service awards for congratulations/catalog redemption to a population of 22,000, and growing! Danielle; thank you for always being a positive presence and managing not only the change and comms for SGWS, but also shadowing the technical workstreams - and we could not have resolved the final launch day 'hiccup' without your expertise. Rachel: thank you for all of your participation, excited to see the future of the Toast program as they eagerly move forward with social recognition launch in phase 2! Cliona: the executive feedback for the final round of mockups tells the whole story - \"looks just like SGWS\"! Thank you for helping this client achieve a very specific vision for their platform! Maura: your technical work absolutely made the difference in this project! Thank you for keeping this project on track with your proactivity, and for all your quick pivots and responsiveness! And to folks across global strategy, branding, customer service, quality assurance, production support, fulfillment, operations.. - THANK YOU! The client was so impressed with our technical and operational teams responsiveness and the results. Congratulations again to this outstanding group!\n\n191#focus@bp is ready for UAT|THANK YOU ALL so much for getting us to this point! focus@bp is ready for UAT and it is so much in part to you and your efforts over the past week. There have been many technical challenges including languages not updating, translations being entered, SSO, lightbox updates, branding updates, etc. Thank you all for your support and keeping me apprised of the various workstreams that have been involved. I am excited to move into this next phase of launch with you all, and with the bp team!\n\n192#Support for the support|Rich, thank you for your support while I was away. When initially taking time off, I couldn't of anticipated that my some of my launches would land on that exact week.  As we prepared, you stayed in the loop and what was upcoming as well as the initial action plan.  When questions and items came up, you supported both Kat and Nick, but also to the client directly.  Reviewing the emails that came through both internally and externally, the word that came to mind was grounded as in all the projects stayed grounded to the goal at hand which is a successful launch.  You even told me not to worry and that the team would handle it and that you all did.  Thank you for your help!\n\n193#Pfizer - One for the Record Books!!!|They say it takes a village and looking at this selling team, that statement could not be more accurate.  This $25M win at Pfizer is one of the largest in Workhuman’s history and has so many implications considering the current global context. Our discussions with Pfizer began back in 2007, making this 15 years’ worth of deposits.  Anyone that participated in and of those meetings played a role in this win. That said, when Alex Paz took this account over in the summer, he was intent on moving these discussions into actions.  He took the proverbial bull by the horns and aligned the perfect team to move this forward.  It began with a tight RFP response and custom demo and content, thanks to Michael, Anna and Amanda.  That led to finalist pitches, where Marcy delivered customer-focused insight that only she can.  Alex then brought Joyce, Matt and Rich to the dance to relay our Merck and AZ stories, which became our primary win theme.  And Orlagh delivered all the assurance Pfizer needed from an IT standpoint and Dan & Matt supported us on the product/integration side.  Once we were selected, Chris helped Alex and I align the commercial terms and then the real fun started.  Hillary expertly navigated one of the strangest contracting processes you will ever see, where procurement negotiated the entire agreement.  Julia also pinch hit at the end to iron out some MSA terms.  Thank you!  As we move to launch success, a special thank you to Amy for her leadership and support along the way. This entire team should be incredibly proud not only for the impact this will have on Workhuman, but also for the difference it will make for the 80,000 Pfizer colleagues who are also doing amazing, life changing work.  Let’s enjoy this one for a bit!!\n\n194#A week of challenges and  Many Questions!|I wanted to send out a sincere thank you for helping answer so many questions this week. There are a lot of moving pieces with any launch but one of mine required a lot of hand holding this week. The teamwork has been essential in keeping the conversation going and steering the ship in the right direction.  I am so fortunate to be on a team that is so supportive! Appreciate all the meetings attended, slack questions answered and impromptu zoom session! Thank you!\n\n195#Launch Dream Team!|Rich, Nick and Kat have done such an amazing job of stepping in and addressing all of the last-minute questions and action items regarding WEX's launch today. The dedication they have shown to this customer is world-class. They have all worked tirelessly and efficiently both internally and externally to ensure a smooth launch experience. Kat really got this ball rolling by providing comprehensive solutions to the customer's initial issues on Friday, escalating things to Rich and creating open lines of communication between internal teams. Rich and Nick took the baton and ran with it, meeting with WEX on a Monday morning call, logging urgent tickets and responding quickly to ensure that we hit launch day deadlines. Thank you for showing WEX what a powerhouse our Launch team is!\n\n196#WEX Friday Fun|Huge thank you to this whole team for jumping in and saving the day right before the WEX launch. It's always a stressful moment when a client tells you on a Friday night that they can't log into Production and they're going live on Monday morning. Peter, you did a wonderful job escalating the client's issue to me and helping quickly talk me through their current state so that I understood the places to look for the issue. Rich, you escalated this one lightning-fast to make sure we got the right people involved to resolve. Lauren, you collaborated with us to streamline client communications. Brian and Yohana, you worked quickly to troubleshoot and fix the issue, and the client confirmed that they were able to successfully get into Production and start a nomination. It was a whirlwind hour at the end of the day, but because of this team's commitment, the client should have a smooth launch day.\n\n197#Launch Team Champions!!!|Dear Launch Team, I wanted to send this recognition in light of what was definitely the busiest ever year for the launch team. There has been some super significant and biggest ever launches(YET!!) with Accenture, IBM/Kyndryl and more. Looking back on the launch notes of Jan 2021, seeing launches like Edgewell, RGP, Cree, LogMeIn, Organon and much more,  reminds me of all the incredible hard work and dedication that was done in the year. I am so glad that I have the privilege of hosting our weekly Launch Meetings and interacting and collaborating with all of you wonderful humans. RingTheGong is now one of my favorite slack channels to celebrate all the successes we have together. It's incredible to see how much is achieved.

Rich, You are the champion of the launch processes. Liz, you have just gone and launched our biggest ever client (#legend), Judith you know everything there is to know about launch and the true leader of SMB's), Shawn you are continuously knocking it out of the park and my go to with any launch question, Matt C, every launch of yours I see goes so smoothly.

Kel, working with you on Kyndryl showed me how awesome you truly are and how much great things there are to come. Nick, seeing Hess pop up on Ring the Gong just reminds be of the amazing work your doing. Jen, Rahul and Jamie, I have enjoyed collaborating with you so far and you have all been a joy to work with. Looking forward to all the future launches and I am so excited to see what is to come. It is truly an honor working with you all and I am excited to see what 2022 brings for you.\n\n198#Invoice Mapping Complexity for AstraZeneca|A huge thank you for your diligence, collaboration and smarts to come up with a solution to support AstraZeneca's complex mapping structure. With over 100 entities, including 1-1 and many-to-one relationships, it was super helpful to jump on a call, understand the complexity and work together to get this one resolved. I am so grateful for all of your help to get this one fixed and understand this for the future. Thank you!\n\n199#Standing Ovation|As the last of our launches in 2021 now live, I have to pause and acknowledge all of your efforts this year.  You had a combined 76 net new and post launch projects – take a bow!  It’s a grind of patience, consulting, leading, managing and of course rinse and repeat on the same customer.  You all have incredible talent to bring work human to our customers. The  passion for their success and giving them the best program possible is clear across this team. I hope you all pause and reflect on your own journey this year, how you’ve done individually and as a team. And Rich…You lead from the front with confident, conviction and courage. You push the boundaries for more for each team member to be their best, for our processes and for yourself. Thank you all for an incredible year!\n\n200#Celebrating One Million Moments at AZ|Thank you all for taking the time to record a video and help us celebrate one million recognition moments with AstraZeneca. I'm not sure where the last 2 years have gone but it's an honor to work with a customer at the forefront of this pandemic and I really appreciate everyone's help to share our gratitude and celebrate this milestone. Extra shout out to Allie for bringing it all together and Joyce for wordsmith mastery. Video here: https://weworkhuman.wistia.com/medias/09a804yioq\n\n201#Superman to the rescue|Rich,  Thank you so much for leading the call with ATD.  You were able to keep them positive, focused, and moving forward which was a tall order.  I loved how you kept focusing on a positive end result vs the obstacles they could only see.  You also moved meetings and made them a priority in spite of holiday calendars.  Thank you so much for your leadership, expertise,  and positive attitude.  Your tone and personal style set the meeting for a positive experience by all.\n\n202#Thank you!|Rich, thank you for your partnership with Human Engagement throughout the year, but especially recently with the work you've done to help streamline our current process for enablement of Onboarding guides at new launches. While we work towards a more complete technical solution, this incremental improvement is a really big help and is much appreciated.\n\n203#A-synchronous = A-mazing!|Rich: thank you for demonstrating excellence every single day, and thank you specifically for the innovative 'asynchronous' learning you worked through with me last week! You have so many responsibilities, and I always appreciate the time you take to delve into specific questions and opportunities to benefit our clients. On a deadline, you helped me deploy new knowledge on Excel-based macros to the benefit of an important project milestone. I'm so grateful for your leadership, and the way you take this core value to heart and lead our team by example. I also appreciate your creativity, and the new ways you've brought the team together to consider new ideas. The ability to share knowledge across a team growing bigger by the day will be critical to Launch success in 2022, and thank you again!\n\n204#Amazing TEAMWORK- welcome EmblemHealth!|Thank you for being part of this EXTRAORDINARY team that worked hard to stand out & above competition, walk hand in hand w/ EmblemHealth through: their RFP process, very arduous security assessment, Finalist/Finalist/Finalist pitches & contracting reviews to officially get contract documents signed today! Emily, thank you for working diligently to get EmblemHealth's MNDA approved & signed- great first impression when we turn client contract documents requests around quickly! Amanda, the EmblemHealth team loved our Zoom backgrounds- just one of the many examples of how we differentiated ourselves! Anna & Michael, thank you for all of the work & support during the RFP process- & follow-up afterwards!  Orlagh, thank you for answering the 1,000+ security questions & passing the IT security audit! Mike, thank you for your partnership during the Finalist pitches!  Omar, I SO appreciate your time, the effort & encouragement you provided throughout the entire presentations & demos course since we were fortunate to have multiple Finalist pitches!   Dave, thank you for leading the Value Creation Workshop with Joe & Adele- it really helped us get the investment validated  & open to even a greater investment in the future!  Christie, thank you for starting the initial contract package review!  Julia & Hillary, thank you both for partnering together to join the client/Legal meetings, reviewing/editing/offering approved language that allowed us to get all of the contract documents signed! Rich, thank you for meeting with the LOBs to get a jump start on employee data specs, SSO & branding! John, I truly appreciate all of the 1,000s of things you did to support me since May 5th from client intros, the RFP, meetings, finalist pitches & demos, contracting- all the way through to contract signature- THANK YOU! ALL, I am most grateful for YOU and your contributions to bring another new prospective client to the WH family!\n\n205#Growth Mindset for the Win!|Rich, it was great meeting with you this week on your launch initiatives, which will truly impact the company and our customers' success! You have been a wealth of knowledge with your data, brainstorming notes, and strategy which has been instrumental in getting me up to speed to be able to dive in soon. I also appreciate how open and intrigued you were by a couple of ideas on asynchronous working/communication! Utterly thankful that you ran with a real life scenario right away with the Ecomm macro example. The video you created will not only impact the LSM that needed this information, but great to know this knowledge will be out there for the masses, and without the headache of schedule coordination to share it! I am excited to be working with you again and can't wait to see how our partnership evolves!\n\n206#How do we get better?|Rich, Brenda and Amy: thank you so much for attending the mobile workahead meetings! As a team we are always looking for new ways to improve and the three of you were very supportive when we roped you in. You were all open to sharing your experiences and to give us feedback on ways we can better the launch process and improve the promotion of mobile at launch. We came away with some great action items and I am excited to see the results!\n\n207#Recognition for 'Your Recognition'!|Team; thank you all for your collaboration on a hugely successful launch of Deloitte Ireland's Your Recognition platform! Grateful to celebrate with this team for their planning, site design, technical work, behind the scenes preparation, and training/communications expertise that have helped Deloitte achieve fantastic initial results. Their new program is driving positive feedback from all levels of the organization, including the CHRO/CEO who have both been active in the platform. The CHRO shared \"Superb team effort Deloitte and Workhuman, really well done everyone!\". We're on track for a great long term partnership that started with a successful sales relationship, an on-track 3-month project, and an attentive client team already excited to tackle their next goals. Sincere appreciation and cheers to this group!\n\n208#MS Teams Integration Virgins No More|Many thanks for your rapid response to my call for volunteers to help us test the install of the MS Team integration in your 'pristine' environments.  The tests were hugely useful in helping us see an experience that is reported by just a few users but we can now show is down to timing.  I do appreciate you stepping into the fray very last minute and responding to my unusual call with good humor and a sense of learning and cooperation.  I hope the experience was good for you.  Plus I leave you with the gift of receiving award notifications via MS Teams - you are welcome!\n\n209#Recruitment & Hiring Dream Team|I am thrilled to give my very first recognition moment to the recruitment and hiring team that brought me onboard!  The team made me feel respected and valued through every step of the hiring process.  My journey started with an informal meeting with Adam Basilio, who embraced Eric Mosely's philosophy that, \"its all about finding the right people, first, and then the right role\" within the organization.  Victoria Mitchell was a true recruitment partner - in our initial phone interview, she had an exceptional understanding of the Launch Success Role and what it would take to be successful.  Victoria and Ryan Nelson coordinated an amazing line up of interviews, first with Rich Sorrentino, my hiring manager.  As Rich shared more about his team and the Launch Success Manager role, it became clear that the LSM role was a great fit for me; and that Rich cares deeply about his team, his clients, and Workhuman.  (All very important for me to see in my new manager.) If I was not already sold on Workhuman as an employer, I was certainly sold after meeting with the next 5 members of the WH family, Matt Gillen, Brenda Pohlman, Kat Foley, Kerri Falkenham, and Amy Martin.  I enjoyed meeting and interviewing with every member of this team and, believe it or not, I felt energized after 5 back-to-back interviews and presentation.  Thank you for making the recruitment and hiring process more enjoyable and human than I thought possible!\n\n210#Appreciation Recognition!|Rich, thank you for everything you did to launch Solar Winds!  This was a unique launch for both of us.  Initially, they were adamant on a very specific program design.  Given your experience, you understand the program configurations which will be successful and what should be avoided altogether.  I’m sure there are times where we provide our recommendations the best we can, but ultimately accept the client’s request especially when trying to meet a tight launch date.  This was an example of us respecting the client’s opinion, while also guiding them to a program design that will provide the best return on their budget.  We landed on a program that will do just that.  Thank you for your leadership on this launch!\n\n211#Energizer support!|Rich thanks for your support with getting involved with Energizer for some of the Early Decision Guidance.  They made us VOC and of course then wanted to move very quickly to go live with their new program. You jumped on our weekly call to share with them what the project would look like, the timelines and then followed up with information on what they can be working on until we can fully engage them with their WH launch team.  This is such a helpful process to keep them moving along with getting contracts completed and showing what kind of partnership they can expect.  You are fantastic resource.  Thanks for your great work.\n\n212#Prepare for launch|As I reflect upon the last 4 months and the start of my journey here at Workhuman, I am truly grateful to be part of such a supportive team.  During this time, I have been working on learning the process of launch and the philosophies of Workhuman while every person has welcomed me onto the team, answered all my questions and has been more than happy to share their expertise and friendship with me. This makes me feel truly humbled to be part of such an amazing group of people. Looking into next week our team will continue to grow and I can’t wait to help welcome them with open arms as you did me. Thank you for all you do!\n\n213#Words Matter!|Rich, I wanted to say thank you for proactively identifying some older terminology that we in the Launch team (and other teams) use, and providing some suggestions for updating these in talk tracks and documentation. I appreciate you sharing an article with us that discusses transitioning away from \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" and moving toward \"allow list\" and \"deny list\" instead. As we integrate this language change into internal and external conversations, we'll be keeping true to Workhuman's commitment of respect for all.\n\n214#Leadership in Action|Rich: thank you for demonstrating leadership in action by supporting me through a challenge with an important clients payroll process. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn from your approach in this case, as we work through different ways to help the program experts deliver successful recognition to their teammates. Navigating a complex topic requires experience and confidence, and thank you for supporting this launch with your skills and leadership.\n\n215#DFCI|Rich, Thank you for helping us on our finalist pitch with DFCI. You went outstide your normal role and helped us out tremendously. Not only did you speak to our customer success, you chimed in during the presentation with great expertise. Your input was great and put Workhuman in a spit to WIN! Thanks again for being a great teammate\n\n216#Pfizer - Be Bold...you delivered|Wow, THANK YOU!  You all delivered on our theme for the finalist pitch - Be Bold (we're going to challenge the status quo), Dream Big (Recognition is just the start of the impact you can make on colleague experience), and nothing can substitute experience (both of WH, but more importantly the experience we create for our clients).  Mike, you tied our growth to learning, building a community of innovative companies, and like Pfizer, pioneers.  Marcy, another we got you confidence-building performance; your reporting talk around turning feelings into facts and connecting back to their goals and aspirations was spot on. Joyce, they won't see another provider with as much experience and enthusiasm for the work they need to do and the guidance they will receive based on your work at Merck and AZ - phenomenal. Rich, while we didn't get to you part of the deck, you gave them absolute confidence not only do we have the technology down, but the process is effective yet still agile, and the people on the project take tremendous pride in not just crossed off tasks on a plan, but delivering a world-class experience for all.  Tremendous job all-around team - so proud to have shared the stage with you!\n\n217#A place to grow!|Over the past several months, I have been welcomed into the Workhuman Launch family. Rich you have been instrumental in helping me learn, allowing me to ask questions, practice, and grow in a safe and encouraging way. The coaching, support, feedback, and openness have given me a lot of confidence as I grow and lead my own account. You authentic and genuine leadership has not gone unnoticed. Thank you for all you do!\n\n218#Unlocked the power of SolarWinds|The stars aligned when we had a future customer with an aggressive timeline came along at the same time you wanted to pilot an idea you had to contribute towards launching faster. You joined sales calls to set the stage and consult early on. Recognizing the tight timeline and the key discussions leading up to contract signing, you kept this one. And then you hit a big challenge  - the expectation of $1 award per nomination with a cap. You expertly were able to meet them where they were balanced with where we want them to be in order to be successful (and away from $1 award per nomination). Thank you for all your expedited efforts on top of managing your team, on top of piloting your idea. Congratulations Rich!\n\n219#True Partnership!|Rich,  Thank you for your partnership as we have worked to fill the two openings on your team.  Being so new to the company, it has been super beneficial to work with a hiring manager who gives direct feedback, and is willing to take the time to work through applicants together. Look forward to working together more in the future!\n\n220#Workhuman Credibility Builders|Team - thank you so much for joining the East sales team with little notice this week as we work to bring a new customer on board.  The stakeholders at this future customer had concerns that were holding up our contract process and you each jumped in to set their minds at ease.  Rich - you led the discussion and made sure that the stakeholder team knew they are partnering with the leader and that we have a proven process that will not let them down.  Ger - you confidently addressed their every SSO concern.  Orlagh - you reinforced the robustness of our Info Sec infrastructure and Amy provided the leadership and experience that proved our commitment.  You each left no doubt that the partnership will be a successful one.  Thanks for your time, urgency, and expertise!\n\n221#AND or OR|Thank you all for jumping in to help with JPL's eligibility rule. I felt like I tried a million different ways to write the rule and none of it was working. I appreciate all the suggestions and trials and errors and re-running of the datafile. The rule is now working! Sometimes all it needs is another set of eyeballs, so thanks for lending yours!\n\n222#Leveling Up Our Customer Game|Rich, thanks so much for taking the time to walk the team through a customer launch. It was really eye-opening to see the launch process and how an initial kick-off works. I love that the team was so focused and asked great questions. Looking forward to my continued education on this process!\n\n223#Customer Strategy Champions!|Brenda and Rich,  Thank you both for your help with the Q&A document for sales as well as your support in onboarding new hires! You both jumped on a call with me and also spent time on your own to help with the creation of the Q&A tool which will be a huge resource for the department and ultimately for the organization. Additionally, you joined a call with new hires so they could learn more about the Customer Strategy team and how to effectively partner for a seamless handover, launch, and implementation. You both truly exhibit \"we are better together\" - THANK YOU!\n\n224#Files for all|Thank you both for jumping head first into the Covance data file migration project! It's a unique project since not many customers are on the old, multiple files format and our expertise is extremely limited. And by that I mean, limited to Rich. Thanks Rich for sharing your knowledge and experience to prepare Kat and pass her the baton. And Kat, knowing you, you digest new information so well and will surely impress and delight Covance on your execution. I appreciate you both!\n\n225#A World Gratitude Day \"THANK YOU!!\"|Rich: thank you being a fantastic person, leader, and coach today and always. To echo Eric, \"on this World Gratitude Day, we want to take this opportunity to thank you for your dedication, innovation, inspiration, and for bringing your whole self to Workhuman.\" This is absolutely true. We're grateful for the difference you make for us for all of our projects. Our success comes from your leadership and your resilience, patience, and mindset. Thank you for helping us cultivate our skills and talents, and thank you for appreciating and motivating us to lead our clients forward!\n\n226#It Takes A Village. A Very Large, Large Village.|Talk about it takes a village! Rebecca, Dan, Brian K, Jesse, Brian M, Geoff, Leslie, Danielle, Rich, Amy, Kat, Maggie, Melissa, and Rachel, I can't thank you enough for your efforts and collaboration on Intuit's long awaited program refresh. This opportunity has been years in the making. Getting Intuit to agree to modernize Spotlight's foundation and employee experience was no easy feat. But it pales compared to the countless hours of work and people it took to get us ready once they said yes. Their kick-off strategy session is around the corner and I've couldn't have done it without all of you. Leslie, Amy, Danielle, and Rich, I'm so grateful for your leadership to ensure we had the best team in place to support Intuit and this important initiative. Dan, Brians', Jesse, and Geoff thank you for happily joining the team and creating a custom demo. The site is gorgeous and an essential part of our strategy.  I'm so excited to share it with Intuit's leadership team to help them envision what their optimized program can look like. Maggie, Rebecca, Rachel, Melissa, and Kat, thank you for your thought leadership, guidance, and expertise. Your partnership during our many, many internal prep meetings has been a godsend. You ladies have gone above and beyond - from collaborating on the blueprint of the go-forward strategy, mapping out a project plan, doing CIA level research on key contacts, to ensuring the client experience is tailored and memorable. No stone has been left unturned.\n\n227#Spark Leadership Graduation|Congratulations to you all for graduating from the Spark Leadership program. To get to this point you had to commit a significant amount of time, 6 sessions over a 4 month period. In addition, there was pre-work and follow-up for each session. Somehow you managed to join the sessions with energy and enthusiasm to learn. I enjoyed working with you over these last few months and wish you luck on the continuation of your leadership journey. Thank you and congratulations!\n\n228#Leadership off-site|Rich, you did such a wonderful job this week with your contributions to our leadership off-site. You offered helpful ideas throughout the different sessions, kept us focused on seeing the opportunities vs the problems, and presented thoughtful strategies for improving our time to launch. It's clear that after only a few months, you have really hit your stride in your role as launch manager. Having worked with you for nearly 7 years, I have seen all along how much you care about your work and helping those around you, so I knew you'd excel in a leadership role. Seeing you in action this week confirmed that completely. Additionally, all the skills and strengths you have spent years deepening - growth mindset, mentoring, negotiating, experimenting (just to name a few) - are exactly the things that are making you so successful in this role. I hope you take a moment to be proud of the fact that your passion and dedication got you to where you are today. I am exciting for what's to come and to continue collaborating with you!\n\n229#Collaboration, planning and customer rock stars!|Team,  Thank you all for your participation in our Onsite / Offsite this week.   This dedicated block of time helped us sync up, reconnect, share ideas and plan for the remainder of the 2021 as we prepare for 2022 planning.  Even though some of us were virtual, you all brought your full selves to the meetings and we had meaningful conversations with clear actions.     Jay, Danielle, Jose and Kara, your SWOT analyses of your businesses was insightful and helped us see the broader opportunities and challenges; balancing the broader themes with your books of business.  Mick, you added to that with context around the Client Services segmentation and support approaches.  Amy, you brought great insights into our biggest engagements that helped level-set us.  Rich, your update on scaling launches and your creative ideas for shortening the window sparked great discussions.  Erin, your view of the product update process helped us see path to better collaboration; an AHA moment!  Kerri, thank you for bringing HX context into the discussion and being a great partner in the meeting.  Cam, thanks for the deep and broad update of operations and approaches, not to mention the awesome idea to have a camera on in the room as well as each person’s camera.  Michelle, we now have the data that shows that you and your team are doing heroic levels of work and started to plan out to adjust our plans to support them.  And Dana, thank you for all of your support, coordination, planning and ideas to make it all work.    While I’m eager to get together in person as a group, this was a great chance to spend focused time with all of you and have some laughs. Thank your for time (into the evening for Jose and Mick!), creativity, and partnership.  While some of you may not be great bowlers, you are all great leaders and humans and I appreciate you all.  Onward and upward!\n\n230#Rallying Around the Customer|Thank you, team, for rallying around Nutanix when asked to provide significant guidance on merchandise experience - digging into multiple areas of Workhuman operations, expertise, and personal customer connections. I appreciated the urgent internal collaboration sessions to help plan our approach. The Nutanix team praised our ability to listen to their feedback while still creating an opportunity to help them innovate. Alice, thank you for leading our group to help the customer achieve a successful decision, leveraging a fantastic relationship with a repeat-customer/advocate!  Looking forward to celebrating the success of this program with you all again at launch!\n\n231#Day-to-day leadership|Taking on a new role, one likes to make it their own. And you’ve done that Rich! Product and infrastructure changes afford us to continually evaluate our process. You’ve filled in the gaps as new pieces come into play or target to eliminate extra steps for the team.  Documenting the process is good, eliminating extra steps is better! In addition to that, you strive to continually be the best manager you can be. From training and feedback, your proactive learning never ends and it’s key! You’ve done a truly, tremendous job managing the day-to-day of the launch team!\n\n232#Starting things off on the right foot|Rich,  Thank you very much for taking the time to review the early decision guidance docs, answer questions and send follow-up material to Land O'Lakes.  You were very thorough and made sure they were heard, which I know gave them a great deal of confidence we can get them launched by their date.  Having you participate in these kind of calls sets the client up for success!  Beth\n\n233#Setting up for success!|Rich, thank you so much for your help as I've recently had to navigate some tricky conversations both internally and externally for a few client launches. It's sometimes easy to lose sight of the success part of Launch Success when focusing on issues and hard discussions. You've provided amazing support for me, both tactically and strategically. I appreciate you!\n\n234#90 Days (and more) in Action|Rich; this moment from me to you is overdue, I'm truly grateful your willingness to hear me, see me, and help me do better. We tackle countless, constant, seriously complex tasks/questions in our role, and knowing you're in my corner to support the customer's goals gives me great confidence in a project's success. You proactively dive into issues, reach out to other teams on our behalf, and have an innovation mindset that I certain you'll continue to bring to our other leadership team members. You're in-action every single day to keep our customer launches on track. Thanks again for jumping right in to this role and being a great leader.\n\n235#Happy Launch Day! Cheers is LIVE|Today marks a start to a new journey for NCR! It has been 593 days since the design lab and 623 days since contract signage. NCR's Cheers rewards and recognition program has gone live to 34,087 employees. With approximately 2,353 recognition moments. This customer encountered many hurdles, from internal changes to the global shift due to the pandemic. However, the Workhuman team didn't lose hope in the mission of bringing the power of recognition to all members of the NCR organization. Thank you to the incredible team behind this launch. Rich and Shawn, you both pioneered this launch back in 2019. Mainly by giving the NCR team a design lab to remember and weekly design discussions. You cultivated the customer relationship and set the stage for me to begin supporting the NCR team. Danielle, thank you for leading the communications side of this launch. You help Michelle & Dave thoughtfully plan and roll out the communications plan. Michael, I sincerely appreciate you stepping in to grow the partnership between WH and NCR. Jeremy, Dave, and the team have continuously voiced their gratitude for your support and leadership. Kathy, congratulations on this win. We sincerely appreciate you reaching out to Dave during the past years, re-enforcing the fact that NCR is a valued customer to Workhuman. You all dedicated time and effort to making this launch possible, and should feel very proud of yourselves. Congrats Team!\n\n236#All Together Again!|Thank you, Rich & Amy, for bringing us all together today.  Coming back to the office and knowing my team would be there was an amazing feeling! After over a year, we finally saw each other and met all the new additions to the launch team. The ice breaker gave us a chance to truly bond and learn from one another. Not to mention the ideas shared on improvement strategies. I sincerely appreciate you putting this together!\n\n237#Time to Unwind|Matt and Rich, thanks so much for covering me all week while I was enjoying some quality time with my family. We got to go up to Maine for kayaking, swimming, and tubing and Wyatt and I also went on a whale watch in Boston harbor! I really appreciate you treating my clients as if they were your own, especially with some of the requests I saw from JPL. It was nice to be able to completely unplug. Thanks again!\n\n238#Making us all better|Thank you for supporting some recent technical questions about UAT and the WH launch process! It is immensely valuable to have a real-time lifeline that can provide additional layers of detail when needed. You pitched in not once, but twice yesterday for Prudential, and I greatly appreciate the promptness and thoroughness with which you responded. I know how much you have on your plate, so this was especially generous. Thank you!\n\n239#Off & Running on Deal of the Accentury|Team -  We are less than a week since the signatures we drying on the Accenture contract and each of you has already had many conversations and calls with our newest large client!  All through the sales cycle Tom, Grant, the team and I stressed how great our CSM and Consulting teams are - and you are proving it daily!  Thank you all so much for the attention to detail that you already exhibit!  Accenture knows that they are in good hands and we will make them more successful than ever!\n\n240#Completing the Transition|Even though Beaumont launched a couple of weeks ago, you both have gone above and beyond to make sure the relationship remained positive before transitioning to post-launch Customer Success.  Nick,  from the YOS catchup awards, to the all-employee launch day award, to the countless training questions, there was a lot to coordinate. I appreciate you extending your regular calls and continuing to meet with their group until we have closure.  Rich, I appreciate your leadership jumping in over the last few weeks.  You helped us get approval for some sensitive topics.  Also, meeting with Gianna earlier this week and giving her the opportunity to provide feedback over the last few months went a long way.  It demonstrated that we truly do care about their experience.  Gianna's most recent feedback proved how much she values the partnership the Launch team has developed.  As a CSM taking over this account, I appreciate all the work that was done to not only launch this client successfully, but developing the relationship where it's stronger today than it's ever been.  Thank you!\n\n241#Congrats on a superb launch!|Rich & Mark, congrats on the launch of Organon's Inspire platform! This has been a long road, over a year in the making. As a spin off of Merck, Organon not only wanted a program that inspires their purpose but also drives their culture, much like Merck's Inspire platform did for them. I'm proud to say, that it is a smashing success! Rich, you are such an amazing  teammate. You put your 'all' into these launches and when there are challenges along the way, you find the path to success! This launch was no exception. The Organon team boasted about your attention to detail, responsiveness and professionalism. Mark, thank you for all of your support throughout this launch. Much of what you do is behind the scenes including preparing for the all employee \"Her Day\" team award, which was such a delightful surprise to Organon employees upon spin.  Thanks to both of you, this new customer is off to an incredible start! Thank you!\n\n242#Default password help|Rich, thanks so much for meeting with me to walk through your experience with adding default passwords for customers that didn't provide one in the past. This was one of those scenarios that had me thinking this should be straightforward but it probably isn't, hah! I put the question out to the team for help and was so happy you answered. The experience you shared and your advice has me off on the right track to help Corning increase mobile adoption. Thank you!\n\n"
"243#Branding backup|Rich, thank you for covering for me with the DXC branding work last week while I was out on vacation.  This time sensitive project made me second guess even taking my time off but thanks to your offer to run point on the project I was able to fully disconnect.  I really appreciate you convincing me to enjoy time with my family.  I am excited to continue to work together to bring phase 2 of DXC over the finish line with you over the next few weeks (hopefully... haha).  Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support!\n\n244#Superb Client Execution!|A massive thank you to the team that managed to get Link Group launched! This was a very long implementation journey, that started back in 2018...after a false start and a change in exec sponsor, you finally managed to guide them through a highly successful programme design and launch. Thanks to each of you for your persistence, patience and dedication to high quality!\n\n245#Rock Stars|Team,  I want to send this recognition moment to thank each of you for taking the time to interview the various Launch Success Manager candidates we brought in for this role. Your expertise helped in securing our strongest candidates and I am extremely grateful for that. Rich, congrats on a successful interview process and your guidance throughout. Every time I work with this team, it always makes me excited. Looking forward to seeing the continued success of this group and what we will accomplish together moving forward.\n\n246#A Huge Launch Week!|Amy and Rich,  this week has seen 4 new customer launches (Link Group, Zimmer, Beaumont Health and Fujifilm.  They teams have come together for successful planning and configuration and now successful launch.  Through these launches, you’ve both provided direction, coaching and guidance to keep them on track.  The results are now over $14Million in programs being launched.  Thank you for keeping the launch schedule regular and successful and making a week like this seem like normal operations.  Well done!\n\n247#Being Extraordinary for Beaumont!|Rich, thank you for stepping in while I was out of the office to address Beaumont's urgent needs for launch. I appreciate you reaching out to internal stakeholders while also updating our client contacts to keep them in the loop. Beaumont realized their post cards to encourage employees to log in were received too far in advance of  their official launch date by employees, and you jumped on addressing this Friday morning. They have also had last minute addendum needs that were surfaced and facilitated by you effectively internally here. Thank you for keeping us on track and for your thorough communication!\n\n248#Teamwork can solve any mystery!|We were able to solve one of the largest art heists of this century through tenacity, cunning and puzzle-solving skills! Thanks to you all for taking the time to participate in a the team building zoom call.  With a host who had an off-the-charts energy level it was great to take the time to jump in, turn on those creative juices and have a few laughs. And special thanks to Dana for coordinating our host and schedules.  Looking forward to our next team-building meeting to be IN PERSON!\n\n249#Embracing your role|Rich, I wanted to take a moment to say what an outstanding job you’ve done transitioning into your new role. It’s a difficult balancing act of managing your existing launches and managing your new team. You dove right into understanding their projects, their styles and how best to support them. In addition to the team, you’ve also dove into process efficiencies and improvements. We have a proven process but how do we continually evolve to be even better. You’ve gathered information from the team, from yourself and from our customer experiences across multiple work streams to determine where a path can open. Your passion for our customers having the best experience shines bright as you’ve embraced the role and I’m excited as I continue to watch you settle in.\n\n250#Quick turnaround!|Thanks for your super quick responses to my questions regarding a number of upcoming launches. With a loaded June calendar, Operations wanted to ensure we were fully prepared and knew about every wrinkle in each program! This will give us the optimal chance of providing the best customer experience right from the start with these new clients! Much appreciated!\n\n251#We know that WE know!|Team, thank you so much for your participation and knowledge sharing at our training this week. There is so much that we can learn together as we grow as a team to create solid process, resources and guidance on the way we interact with our customers. Special thanks to those in the group that lent their voices and expertise to the training to further refine and enhance the experience for all. Now we can say that WE know!!\n\n252#Departmental Security Review|Hi folks,  Thanks so much for taking part in our first departmental security review as part of our ISO27001 work.   We're looking forwards to using the results of the questionnaire as a way to increase the security alignment across the organization and we really appreciate the time and effort that people took in their responses!   best regards, Dermot\n\n253#Citi Branches Out!!|A huge thanks and congratulations to this team for successfully getting Citi Live on Community Celebrations this week!! From our Q4 Business Review meeting where we explored the various ways the Citi Program Team works with internal business segments on requests for Citi Gratitude, we learned that many \"programs\" are turned away because they are more participation vs performance driven---Lynette suggested the team consider Community Celebrations as a great way to bring those groups in while reinforcing Citi Gratitude. That started the chain of events leading to Go-Live this week. Key calls/meetings/demos with Rachel, Cam and Tim early on convinced Citi it was the right course of action. Project Team calls with Rich, Dan, Amy, Jay and Eileen got us organized internally to deliver.  Communications planning with Tirrill and Lynette provided Citi the tools to launch to Managers. Technical and Production Support assistance throughout from Rich, Tim, Michelle, Brian, and Stephen was critical this week. Alan and Mikael assisting with Pendo support. Steve assisting with overall Renewal and Finance coordination as usual. Thank you All for making this successful and we hope this will be one of many programs they will add to CC down the line!\n\n254#DXC Ya Later!|Chris and Team, congrats on a tremendous win at DXC.  Selling a deal one time is hard enough, but getting an e-thanks only client to add points is another \"unique\" adventure to say the least.  This client expansion from non-monetary to a $5M budget, certainly began with building a vision with DXC over the years (I think it may be 8 years to be exact).  Chris you found a way to stay resilient through the ups and downs (with support from Tim G), built great relationships within the account and sold the business value of our solution which made all of the difference.  Thanks Rob S for supporting us and helping us differentiate along the way. We also had incredible support from the client team (thanks Joyce) and launch (Rich, Liz and of course Amy) who delivered a successful experience during the e-thanks deployment, ensuring DXC was confident in moving to a monetary program.  And as most complex deals often do, they get a bit tricky there at the end and our team rose to the challenge.  Orlagh provided everything we needed to from an IT stand-point, which is never easy when dealing with a global technology company.  Julia, can't say enough about your continued partnership and this is another great example of strong sales/legal alignment.  Thank you!  Jen and Chris O'Sullivan, you both stepped up to help support DXC with some questions related to grossing up, which further solidified us as a strong long-term partner.  And of course, Tom V your guidance and involvement with this deal from the very beginning is worthy of a big thank you!  This win truly brought out the best in us, across so many parts of Workhuman, as we secured another impressive logo.  You all should be proud....enjoy!!\n\n255#DAU/WOW!|Congrats to this team for remarkable early results in our latest launches, including Cytiva, where we're seeing a near 20% relative lift over the control group! Thanks to your efforts, employees at these companies now use the product more - and more often. On top of that, the great onboarding guides you've developed have users demonstrating greater mastery of product concepts right from launch. This leads to less employee confusion, fewer support calls, and lower friction for the program teams. Seeing it all executed with rigorous A/B testing and a clear focus on achieving success metrics is inspiring. Great work!\n\n256#Appreciating You!|Customer Success Teams thank you for the amazing work that you do for our customers everyday! We wanted to take a moment on Employee Appreciation Day to appreciate all of you for your truly impactful work. Even in the remote world that we’ve all been in over the past year you haven’t missed a beat and continue to change the world through how you engage with our customers and other internal colleagues. As we strive to bring recognition to the global workplace you are all making an impact through your efforts, activities and thoughtful interactions. From, Jay, Jose, Danielle, Michelle and Amy\n\n257#Celebrate Good Times, Come On!|Sing it with me now!  This isn't just an award, this right here is a celebration!  \"So come on, let's celebrate.  It's a celebration.  Yahoo!\"  That's right, it's a celebration for Rich for his incredible patience, perseverance and persistence in working with the PM at Cytiva to launch their Service Milestone Awards.  Rich launched this client way back in December and, like any seasoned LSM, he had his exit strategy well planned out.  What he didn't count on were the additional meetings and the questions and calculating and re-calculating SOLI values and comparisons with Cytiva's former parent company GE and everything else that have dragged this out for the past month or so.  Until now.  Until just now when we received an email that literally said \"Looks good.  Let ‘er rip.\"  So in the morning, when dawn breaks, Rich will do just that.  And doing so will unleash service awards across Cytiva's employee base going all the way back to April of 2020.  And then the celebration for all of them will begin.  So I thank you Rich.  It's been quite a ride and I have learned so much from you through this launch.  Hope you take a few minutes to celebrate & sing & dance.  You've earned it!\n\n258#Phone a Friend|I wanted to say thanks for being my 'phone a friend' on Friday with the Accenture sample data file. Ten minutes into refreshing myself on initial troubleshooting without notepad++, I realized it would have taken me way too long to get back up to speed. I so appreciate your help getting the sample file loaded!\n\n259#Enabling our new hires for greatness!|Team- You have all been involved with our new hires, some of you have volunteered to be their buddies and others have taken on various training subjects throughout the past year(s) and some have stepped up to do both! A few of you have even helped with our interview process to ensure we bring the RIGHT people onto the team. You all have really helped with the onboarding process as a whole as it can get pretty stale listening to the same person (me) over and over again :) This effort is often something that is overlooked, but I wanted to truly thank all of you for taking leadership and stepping up to the plate by taking the time out of your busy days to assist with this very important process.  We will continue to rely on you as our team continues to grow, and really appreciate it!\n\n260#A very promising beginning!|Thank you all for your work on our first enterprise user onboarding experience. We are now >30 days in with Cytiva and 10 days in with Edgewell and we are seeing clear signs in the data that the onboarding experience that you all contributed to is effective at helping users understand how the program works and how they can participate, and, most importantly, driving them to take key actions. We are seeing excellent guide view data (the number of people who choose to take the tour), significantly more users uploading user photos (important for making the site feel human and providing social proof), significantly more users starting and completing nominations (this is very good), and more users going to my mobile as well. A key indicator that these guides are having the effect we want is that users who see the guide have much higher nomination completion rates than those who do not see the guides. It's early days; we'll want to validate across more clients, and certainly test improving it even more, but what a promising beginning! Alan - you were the director of it all, keeping it moving, putting forth suggestions, doing setup and problem solving, and talking everyone through the details again and again. Lisa - your design work on the guides was fundamental! Thank you. Ger - thank you for both your overall support but especially for the animated videos. Melanie - thank you for contributing the right words - they matter! Elise - thank you for helping work through control group approaches and analyses Phil - as always, your contributions to sorting out the overall plan & working through challenges were a huge help Rich - thank you for partnering on this and working through introducing it to the client and being ready for any questions that came up on it Erin - thank you for making sure LS had backup and the right messaging  Matt - thank you for reaching out to us on Edgewell and getting this into their launch Thank you again - we’ve only just begun!\n\n261#Excellent job with a tricky customer request|I can't say enough how tremendously both Rich and Maggie handled a complicated customer launch situation.  This particular customer, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, adheres to a strict Scrum and Work Breakdown Structure project management model and pushed back on our standard launch model of assigning deliverables to the customer and relying on them to set internal expectations and hold their teams accountable to execute that plan.  Both Maggie and Rich pivoted quickly to understand how their models can be adapted to fit within our standard model and presented their recommendations brilliantly to the customer this morning.  The customer expressed their gratitude to the thoughtfulness and dedication that went into the recommendation and feels infinitely more comfortable moving forward with the next phase of the launch.  The trust that was built through this will be invaluable moving forward as they will be more amenable to Workhuman recommendations.  Great job Maggie and Rich!\n\n262#Mr. Miyagi of Integrations!|Rich, thank you so much for your hard work and effort on OMERS Workday integration project. You guided the client through the necessary steps and were a constant source for information, even above what was necessary. Thank you for the weekly calls (for months) to keep us on track, and for circling back to make sure I felt confident in moving forward. Your expertise on the product and ability to articulate what was needed with the client was very impressive. You went above and beyond for the client, especially with a few of the gratuitous requests. I'm so appreciative of your patience and guidance throughout this project. Couldn't have done it without you.\n\n263#J&J Assist|Team! J&J's YOS testing process has been a strange one. from last minute branding changes that meant they couldn't test, to last minute WBAUs run based on strange dispatch dates. Alise - thank you for jumping in and helping make sure the client's awards got loaded with not one, not two, but three different WBAUs run (with me pinging you in a panic about the shared / privacy settings!). Shawn/Rich - when the newsfeed delay had run its course and we noticed that some awards still weren't appearing, you both jumped in to help me troubleshoot and figured it out! Thanks team! I know Q4 is a lot of controlled chaos, and appreciated you pausing in your day to help get this one over the line :)\n\n264#Ready, Steady and Launch!!!!|To Amy, Rich, Shawn, Dan, Liz, Nick, Judith, Matt Carroll and Matt Gillen.  I wanted to recognise each and everyone of you for all the work that you all have put into the Weekly Launch Meetings with our team each Wednesday. I have been hosting these for a few weeks now and have been supremely impressed at the level of quality you deliver and excellent updates you provide each week. You all take the time each week to keep us informed on any urgent request, upcoming QA/UAT weeks, any autobau or wbaus on launch. I can go on and on!! Dan you provide the weekly spreadsheet each week to help us navigate the upcoming launches. Amy as every you offer such great leadership and guidance on launches. There has been so many clients this year we have all worked on. Even in the last number of weeks. Shawn you have managed Christiana Care,NCR and the exciting IBM project. Rich with the recent launch of Cytiva, State Street and Aviva. Judith you had Resource REIT, LLA, Moderna. Liz you have Manulife, Takeda and the new project for J&J. Nick with Nordson, Bobcat and now Cree. Matt C with 3D Systems, Amadeus and Snyopys. Matt G with P&G earlier in the year and now Health First and Edgewell. You all do such an amazing job in leading these launches. Congrats to each of you on every success this year and to many more perfect launches. Awesome work everyone :D if ever a team deserved a Workhuman Ring The Gong Trophy it is the launch team!!!!\n\n265#Celebrating Cytiva!|Rich, Devon, Iveta, and Sarah - congratulations on the Cytiva launch today! With your help over 7,000 Cytiva employees in 40 countries will be able to celebrate the accomplishments of their colleagues every day. We had a tight timeline on this one - just over 60 days - but thanks to your hard work we were able to make this happen for Cytiva!  Rich - You've built the relationship with Jennifer and team from Day One. You've helped navigate some muddy waters by steering them in the right direction on key decisions and project timing. Your support was absolutely crucial in ensuring they were set up properly and effectively for our tight launch timing.  Devon - Thanks for your support and being involved with the launch process. Creating the relationship with the Cytiva team early on helps them feel more comfortable and supported by us for the long haul.   Iveta and Sarah - Cytiva loved the visual campaign! While their branding looks simple, it's quite complicated behind the scenes. They were singing your praises on how you incorporated the branding into their poster, digital signage and intranet banners. Thanks for all of your help and partnership!\n\n266#Welcome onboard humans!|Accompanying today's Cytiva launch, we launched a new onboarding experience for users reaching the platform for the first time. Over the last few weeks, your collective input has produced something that looks fantastic and helps introduce users to the basic concepts of recognition from the get-go.  It nudges users to accomplish some key actions in their early visits, like uploading a photo, placing an award, and familiarising themselves with mobile.  Ger/Lisa, thank you for working your creative magic into the guide design; Melanie, for taking my initial clunky set of words and crafting it into something much more elegant!; Julie, for your fantastic ideas as we worked through the concept and execution, and Rich, for your enthusiasm when we talked about this idea initially and putting forward Cytiva as a great fit for launch.  Thank you for making this innovation happen.\n\n267#Lifesaver|Rich, Thanks for helping me out with various pieces of IBM's UAT. First, you took the initiative to join their two hour UAT kick off call. During such a busy time of year it is a big as for an 'extracurricular', if you will. You provided really valuable feedback. Then today when I asked if someone could help me get into Sandbox to test some UAT issues, you went above and beyond. We have been having a hard time reproducing some of the issues and have to test in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari for Mac. We did testing together on your PC and then you went a step further by testing the issues on your Mac to see if it could be reproduced... and it could! Thank you for taking time to help me out and for going the extra mile.\n\n268#Not Your First Rodeo|Clearly, this is not your first rodeo Rich.  I just want to take this opportunity to thank you both for your leadership and for your partnership during the Cytiva launch.  I have really appreciated the opportunities you have given me to step in and share my perspective on certain key topics.  You are incredibly organized in your approach including when you strategically look to me to speak on a topic.  This is helping me establish credibility and rapport with the program team early on which is so important.  And I have also appreciated the laughs that we've had with this team.  It's great to be able to work hard and also have a bit of fun along the way.  I am looking forward to getting Cytiva Celebrates up and running in a few short weeks and helping them invest those December dollars into the program!  YEEHAW!!!\n\n269#High Praise from DXC|Rich/Joyce,    I wanted you to both see the email I received from Ria McVeigh at DXC today.  It's always fantastic to hear this high praise from a customer, so I couldn't have said this any better....  As we approach our global launch next week, we wanted to take the time to recognize the amazing partnership Rich and Joyce have showed us over the past few months.   Rich came on with a lot of work to do within a shortened timeframe, and he quickly stepped up and we had a wonderful shift in progress. I felt like he understood and heard us and it made a huge difference.   Joyce has been incredibly dedicated to driving success for our recognition program every step of the way. Her expertise in how to best engage our people as we launch this has been invaluable. And we always felt like we were in good hands with Joyce and very much appreciate her partnership – and she is also fun to work with.  Rich and Joyce partnered with us in a way that makes us feel supported and ready for any challenge that arises. We can’t say enough good things about them! And taking a page out of the book you have shared with us – recognizing people is very important and I wanted to share due praise for the team. We wouldn’t have been able to deliver this important milestone for DXC’s transformation journey without them. It would be great if you could convey this to their leaders as well so they can see how great an impact they have made.\n\n270#Congrats, you're a sinner!|WOO!! or should i say BOO!! Congrats to all our winners from this years Halloween slack events. Well done to you all for your participation and effort, Customer Marketing your submission was hilarious and on theme for our Murder Mystery event. Genessa with your delicious looking 4 legged s'more. Rich and batcat absolutely nailed it! Megan your little pup is just too cute and pretty popular, we're waiting for the instagram...Zhennaa we loved the door dress up, a level up on halloween decoration. Eileen, that zoom themed pumpkin was just too 2020 and it spooked us and Colleen in addition to this your life time supply of Oil of Olay is on the way.\n\n271#Out of the Gate|Rich, You are always a master at sprinkling #momentsthatmatter for our clients. I wanted to call out that right when Workhuman Live Online ended and we started our call with DXC, you already had your Workhuman Certified Zoom background up and visible, which prompted a nice conversation on which of our project team was able to catch the session. Thanks for doing your part to get the #IHaveARight messaging out with our clients.\n\n272#You're a  Workhuman Certified Professional|Congratulations on completing the Workhuman Certified Professional modules! You are among the first to officially earn this designation. Thank you for embracing this new opportunity with enthusiasm, while also juggling your day-to-day work, and supporting our company's vision of bringing greater humanity to the workplace and world through the introduction of the Charter of Workplace Rights and Certified programs.\n\n273#Good Guys for Aviva|Rich, you have been a wonderful team mate supporting me and the Aviva team post launch. Like any new customer, they are super analytical and question everything, but as I keep telling them, 'once you teach a fisherman to fish' it will be plain sailing. I do appreciate you having my back and are always there at the end of a slack chat or a call if I need support or assistance on their WOW Program. I just wanted you know I don't take that for granted! Thanks for all that you do for our customers partner!! :)\n\n274#Strong Start for State Street!|Team, just had to call out what a great job you have all done with getting State Street successfully launched!  In a very short period of time you helped stand up a massive, complex customer and get them off to a smooth start. In addition to managing all the technical needs and details you were able to navigate a daunting array of requirements, challenges and personalities with skill and humor. It was obvious from your wrap-up call that the entire State Street team has enormous respect and appreciation for your efforts. Thanks for your great work and for setting me up for success with them as well!\n\n275#Monumental effort on the launch of State Street|Early in our selling efforts with State Street we drew the analogy of sherpas guiding climbers to the mountain top that we bring SMEs to every engagement so that we can help them climb what seems to be a daunting mountain to the top (launch success).  Well this team of sherpas was just that - you guided them through each step of the process providing knowledge, empathy and energy.  Rich, as launch success manager you set the tone for them feeling confident that we have a proven process, technology and a wealth of experience to help them stay on course and avoid the missteps that take them off the proven path.  Lisa, as the Strategy & Consulting lead you provided a calmness and confidence on the right way to communicate this huge change to their rewards strategy. Michael, you're involvement throughout the process shows that now the baton is being passed that you are knowledgeable about where they came from and where they are trying to go.  Noah, Ashley, Lucas and Dan; while your roles weren't always front and center to the client your contributions don't go unnoticed and will certainly leave a lasting impression on this successful launch and their ongoing success.  THANK YOU to all of you for your efforts, energy and enthusiasm to get another client launched and cheering from the mountain tops!\n\n276#Outstanding Aviva Journey!|Thank you for all your hard work, energy and laser like focus, over the past many months. The roll-out of Aviva's recognition programme has been full of twists and turns and as with all large client deployments, thrown significant challenges at us along the way. Launch day has finally arrived and I can honestly say that Jess, Natasha and the rest of the Aviva team are delighted with the way that things have turned out. Thank you so much for everything you've done to make this customer journey so positive!\n\n277#AvivAWESOME!|Rich, as always, a tremendous pleasure partnering with you on the launch of Aviva, our latest global enterprise client. This one had it's challenges along the way, including frequent changes to all of the key program elements, right up to launch. (\"Decide early, decide once\" is gonna become my new client mantra, I think.) You handled it all with your usual aplomb, offering great advice (repeatedly) to steer Aviva in the right direction. Today, they're far better positioned for success in rolling out to additional markets in the future than they were even a month a go. That's down to you and your patient guidance. Kudos to another great one under your belt!\n\n278#Rich the Reliable!|Rich -  Thank you for your prompt help with Resideo.  As you launched this client over a year ago, I had high hopes that you would recall their configuration set up and be able to assist with an upcoming Oracle change.  You jumped right in to assist me and the client, too.  With your guidance, I am confident this change will be simple and handled appropriately.  I appreciate all that you do, and hope we get to work together on an upcoming Launch one day soon!\n\n279#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt in the first week of go-live to make sure we have all your important information correct!\n\n280#Moment of Gratitude from Sales Bootcamp 2020|A few weeks back, the sales team wrapped up an excellent bootcamp. As part of this experience we had the pleasure of hearing perspective from three very happy Workhuman customers: Claire Wheldon from AstraZeneca, Lark Kalstad from Lam Research / Symmetricom and Peter Church from Avangrid. Each shared important perspective that will help us become a more effective sales organization.   Without a doubt, these conversations would not have been possible but for the many unsung heroes who helped to create, launch and maintain the successful programs from which each of these perspectives were grounded.  While it may have taken a while to track down all who may have been involved, with Meghan Honan’s help, I’m happy to finally be able share this moment of appreciation. Thank you all for helping to make such happy customers AND, by extension, such a memorable conversation and learning experience!:)  AstraZeneca  Ongoing CSM – Kylie McMillian Launch LSM – Rich Sorrentino S&C – Lynette Silva        Lam Research   Ongoing CSM – Claire DiDonato Prior CSM (at Symmetricom) - Marcy Ricci Launch LSM – Rich Sorrentino S&C – Lauren Spenser   Avangrid   Ongoing CSM – Tiffany Steinke  Launch LSM – Matt Gillen S&C – Joyce Silvia\n\n281#The BEST!|Rich, thank you for spending a few minutes with me earlier this week to review some trouble we were having implementing an eligibility rule request for Whirlpool. I shared the customer's current rules and their end goal and within minutes you were able to advise us on how to properly write the rule. Everything is working as expected and this prevented a lot of extra work for both us and the customer. Thank you-- you are indeed THE BEST!\n\n282#Taking The Time.|Thank you so much Rich for taking additional time to support me today through my on-boarding process and helping me prepare to deliver a Quality demo as I progress through these important foundational steps.\n\n283#Just one more thing...|Rich, thank you for working with my client and McKayla to answer the miscellaneous questions that came through, but also reviewed a file!  While I was away, the client asked McKayla if a resource would be able to review a file in my absence otherwise they would wait a week until I was back.  Rich jumped right in and as the master that he is, turned around a review that allowed their team to make the necessary changes to have a successful file! I believe this act shows our client our commitment to being partners and commitment to excellence.  Thank you for your support Rich!\n\n284#Launch after Launch, Success after Success|Everyone, I want to thank you all so much for the incredible hard work, determination, sometimes long hours and fantastic success you constantly bring to every launch you all work on to make these all a huge success.  Amy, I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing leadership you show with your team. Anytime we have worked together on launches. You are instrumental in the phenomenal success that we have with each of our launches.  Liz, You had one of the biggest launches of the year with Pepsi. I know first hand how much brilliant work that you put into getting clients to launch. It was inspiring and you set the standards for dedication and hard work. There were other launches this year in Santander, Corteva and Plantronics.  Rich, With one of the other major launch success stories this year in Astrazeneca. In particular, noting the incredibly complex drools rules. Not only AZ but you were key to some other great launches with State Street, Aviva, LAM Research and Sabre. Shawn, The experience you show on launches is mind blowing. We worked on a few success stories in Stepan Company and EMC Insurance, NCR Corporation. As well as upcoming launches like Day & Ross.  Matt Gillen, I can note the incredible work you did on Manulife and UCB. You managed these so well and I am sure the upcoming launch of Avangrid will be another success story.  Matt Carroll, We have worked together on some great launches. Omnitracs & Emerson were both fantastic launches. There are also some exciting upcoming launches that you are involved with like Teknor Apex. Judith, Working together on launches, you always stun me with the unbelievable level of quality you put into these launches.  There are so many launches with your name on it: Liberty Latin America and so many upcoming launches like LivaNova, RTI and Tracelink.   Nicholas, I have been so impressed to see the great work you are doing with both the launches of PTC and Gundersen. I'm sure these will be great client launches.\n\n285#Always a pro|Rich, a bit delayed here, but wanted to say a tremendous THANKS! for your smooth transition of Lam. The customer has nothing but positive things to say about the entire implementation process, the program is running well, and you have been super helpful in answering any questions I have had post launch (as well as in helping a couple weeks back when I was OOO). You truly are an amazing team member and I know I have been set up for success when you're on the job! Thank you!\n\n286#Thanks for the quick action!|In an effort to promote the global nature of their program, State Street is holding info sessions with their HR teams and wanted to share some screenshots of the redemption homepage for different countries to show how the offerings vary by location. Unfortunately, due to updating merchandise collections, the imagery on those homepages was down temporarily just when we were going in to take the screen shots. Rich – you answered my call for help, troubleshot the issue on your own and then looped in Rick for additional support. Rick – you did a little digging of your own, found out the reason behind the blank picture placeholders and then coordinated with the necessary parties to get them back up and running super fast, all while keeping us in the loop. Ashley – when I needed someone to grab high res screenshots, you jumped right in and first, alerted me to the sandbox issue and then, sent me the screenshots with lightning speed once sandbox was back up and running. While screenshots may seem like a little detail, it will make a big different in getting the folks at State Street excited about their new global program. Thank you all for your respect for urgency!\n\n287#NCR Coverage|Rich, thanks so much for covering me during my vacation last week, particularly for NCR who was in the middle of a contract negotiation and a number of meetings to get them over the line. Your updates were so helpful to me and I am fully aware of all next steps. I really appreciate that I was able to unplug last week and spend some QT with the Bucks!\n\n288#Lam is Launched!!!|Rich, Lauren and Claire I want to thank you all for the FABULOUS job you did on launching Lam!.  I got an invitation from their CHRO yesterday morning to join her and the entire internal team to celebrate the long awaited launch of their new R&R program, via a virtual Happy Hour.  And happy it was!  I got to spend an hour with all of them hearing how amazing the entire Workhuman team was, how we anticipated their every move and need, how the branding that Lauren created is already getting rave reviews across the world, how the CHRO is already hearing great things from across the executive suite and the entire organization, how Rich never ever ever had a question directed to him that he didn't have the correct and complete answer along with an explanation for why, how Claire provided them with one of the most human moments that warmed their hearts when she brought her baby to a meeting.  I cannot thank you enough for the level of professionalism and caring you established with our new client and you have set us up for great success for the future.  Congratulations on another amazing launch, you guys are the best and thank you!\n\n289#Well done getting Executive level support...|Rich, fantastic job guiding the Head of Total Rewards and members of the State Street design team through a best practices discussion on program design.  You did your homework on peer organizations they care about, the commonalities and differences we see in their respective programs, and how that might apply to them.  You moved them down the path of decision making.  I also have to call out your courage at the beginning of the call - I think it set the tone for the remainder of the call and I think it was a huge factor in the the ultimate outcome - the Head of Total Rewards smiling and thanking you for your efforts.  THANK YOU!\n\n290#LSM Certification Success|Liz, Matt, and Rich-There has been an immense amount of work and behind the scenes creation to get this Certification up and running. I want to thank each and everyone one of you for putting in the time to create documentation/presentations, train, and certify on each of these launch topics. We are almost at the end of the certification and let me say, we have come SO far! We now have a full certification schedule, expectations for each milestone, documentation that can be used for a cookie cutter approach moving forward, and trainings on all topics Launch! This could not be pulled together in a cohesive unit if it wasn't for each one of you taking time out of your busy day to get all of this put together. Liz-your attention to detail, organized manner, and delivery of all things strategy has been so impactful and impressive! Matt-you have put together meaningful and helpful documentation on key topics throughout launch and great at role playing! Rich-your DRL's rules and eligibility rule training was so good that it will be going into my arsenal of \"advanced trainings\" for all of Customer Success(hope you don't mind!). You all bring different perspectives from how to position/deliver topics to customer scenarios that you have encountered which is the best way to train a new hire! The end is almost near and with your dedication and involvement, I will be able to package this up and be able to deliver this certification to the next new LSM that walks through this door. Thank you so much!\n\n291#Cut the cord!|Thanks Rich, Lauren, Cam and Hari for your all the quality work, help and assistance each of you provided to get us to this momentous day.  We received official notice today that Lam Research officially shut down their old program as part of the schedule to turn on their new and improved Above and Beyond program in June.  Cam and Hari you were pivotal in getting us into contract and Rich and Lauren you took the ball and seamlessly put our client on the path to delivering their vision for their 10,000 employees around the globe.  Thanks so much for all of your efforts.\n\n292#AstraZeneca AWESOME!!!|Rich, you did such a tremendous job steering the ship on the launch of AstraZeneca!  How big is AstraZeneca? As they just informed us on the team launch call, at the time of launch AZ is the largest company in the UK by market capitalization. How successful was the launch internally? CatAlyZe got more shares on Workplace by Facebook than the news about AZ's partnership with Oxford University to produce the COVID-19 vaccine (something Claire, our program manager, is very proud of). In your five years (so far) at Workhuman, you've got many feathers in your cap for awesome launches, but this one may be the biggest and most colorful feather of all! The AZ team was not easy - lots of questions, lots of ideas on how things \"should\" be, lots of \"cooks in the kitchen\" to manage - all of which you handled calmly, even when conveying the same message for the 12th time, confidently and always with their best interest in mind to deliver a hugely successful and meaningful experience all employees across AstraZeneca around the world. It was a personal pleasure to work with you on AstraZeneca - here's the next one! Congratulations!\n\n293#AstraZeneca Launch Extraordinaire|Ah Rich! This is the day you’ve been waiting for since the contract closed end of September. AZ launching is the culmination of all your dedication, blood, sweat and tears. I wanted to give you a special shout out because most don’t truly appreciate the behind the scenes magic you do to make this mega launch look so flawless. The countless calls day in and day out and some of those calls teeter between you being there as a crutch and running the show. You conducted two design type workshops at the design lab and against at their multiple day workshops over the Thanksgiving holiday. They were so appreciative that you gave up part of your holiday to support them. It’s those little actions that make a difference in the relationship. What people also don’t see is that AZ was tough. Claire gets an idea in her head and you just can't shake it. You would keep pushing, appropriately, to get to the right answer. And then with all the cooks in the kitchen on their side, they'd ask the same question a million times - and you would always patiently answer and clarify each time. You instill confidence in the team with your calming approach, even if you were swimming like duck underneath it! I couldn’t be more happier for you and more proud of you on leading and executing this launch. A tremendous congratulations for the biggest launch of the year! Bravo, bravo, bravo!\n\n294#Rich to the Rescue|Rich thank you so much from taking time out of your day to teach Jess and I how to do a V-look up. Although it is something easy for you, it was a pain to us. This will now help us with the manual task of matching leads from Bizzabo to Salesforce for the Workhuman LiveStream registrants. Our turnaround time will be a lot quicker, benefitting Sales, Marketing, and the Company. Thank you very much.\n\n295#Always on hand!|Rich, just want to take a moment to recognize the great information you've been sharing with me over recent months regarding new launches. Answering all of our questions (and there can be a lot - sorry!) so quickly and in great detail allows us in Operations to best plan for the new program - helping create the best customer experience possible! Much appreciated!\n\n296#Thank You Healthcare Images - Weekend Worriors|Thank you all for jumping in to take part in the logo and image sourcing and uploading for hospitals into the Thank You Healthcare site!  Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring! Thank you also to each of you who dedicated an hour, several hours and in some cases most of the weekend to sourcing and uploading!  We so appreciate your efforts!  Many hands make light work, my mother used to say! I do want to call out a few of you who really made an incredible dent in the project uploading and sourcing between 70 and 230 images each and in many cases hitting both uploading and sourcing!  WOW!  Brian Moore, Matt Durgin, John Wamback, Jon Bizeur, Amanda Salvas, Rich Sorrentino, Jillian Gregoriou and Dan Fiore, you guys are complete rock stars and your contributions were mammoth! This was a true team effort and to see it in action makes me so proud to be a part of our Workhuman family!  Amazing job! Let’s share some gratitude with the world now!\n\n297#Uplifting|Rich, every single person who joins the daily customer success huddle these past few weeks has one and only one goal immediately upon joining.  I call it \"LFR\".  Look. For. Rich. Lots of people jumped on the unique Zoom background trend but no one takes it to Rich Sorrentino level. Props, amazingly varied themes and sheer longevity have made you stand out.  (And you are achieving notoriety well beyond those huddles). But this recognition isn't necessarily for that creativity.  It is the positive energy and enthusiasm you bring to the entire team every day.  You are lifting moods and creating joy in a time when it is most needed.  Thank you for being such a positive force these past few weeks...and I literally can't wait to see what tomorrow brings! #recognizethegood\n\n298#That Sounds Like Fun!|Rich, today I came to you asking the best way to find out the billable total for a potential WBAU. I figured the easiest way to get the figure was to create the WBAU and run it in Sandbox. You saw a larger opportunity and immediately said, \"that sounds like fun!\" Within an hour, I had an Excel calculator to play around with for my client's launch day award. I was able to quickly model out a couple scenarios for them and get back to them in a timely manner. The calculator is definitely going to be a handy-dandy tool in my everything launch toolbox moving forward. Thanks for always being my go-to Excel guru and I hope you had a little bit of fun throwing it together!\n\n299#Resilience all around|This team never ceases to amaze me. Your usual day-to-day launch lives have been completely turned upside down and then sideways, and in some cases upside down again. With a mix of customers still moving forward with on target launches and some delaying due to COVID19, you’ve been learning to adapt and adjust. You’ve gone from sprinting to learning how to jog and in the world of LSMs, that simply is not close to being easy. I wanted to acknowledge your resilience over the past month. The weeks ahead will bring the next launch challenges no doubt, but I know you will succeed again, because we are a team and we are in this together!\n\n300#Travelling Home to Assist with Eligibility Rules|Rich - Between travelling to the Eiffel Tower, running with the bulls, camping, running a marathon, and getting put in house arrest ...I have no idea where you found the time to help me out last week.  When I noticed something was wrong with Lilly's eligibility rules, you did not hesitate in taking a look at them with me.  When we then realized there was a bigger issue at play, you volunteered to work on making the updates right away.  These are not your standard Everyone-Give, Everyone-Receive rules either as Lilly has some complex rules at every award level including Service Awards.  Given your recent work in their program and because of your due diligence in documenting their rules, you were able to make all of the necessary updates that same night and review them with me the next morning.  Because of your quick review and turnaround, the impact of this issue was minimal.  I can't thank you enough for all your help with this and I really appreciate the teamwork.\n\n301#Support System|I couldn't do my job without the support of this team behind me. Each one of you have stepped up to provide live training to our 4 new hires within the last month. I am a control freak and would LOVE to do it all, but I have come to the realization that I can't be everywhere at once. Nor can I be a subject matter expert at EVERYTHING. I want to thank each and everyone one of you for providing your diverse and high level expertise on the trainings for our new hires. They would not be where they are without your support during this onboarding period.\n\n302#BA Urgent Request|I wanted to thank you for being so proactive when BA sent an email that required urgent action. You noticed that Kylie and I were out of the office and you took ownership of the task. Not only you made all the configuration changes, documented it in Salesforce and the COVID-19 spreadsheet, but you also sent Kylie and me the exact configuration you used for our records. I appreciate how customer-focused you are. Thank you, Rich!\n\n303#Zoom Phone testing|thank you all for being active participants in the zoom phone POC. from using the service to providing rich feedback on your experience I appreciate the time and effort you have put into this and how it might have disrupted your normal day to day activity.  proofing out new technology and providing feedback is key to improving the feedback for our employees and I am thankful that you have all been so willing.  thank you for your help.\n\n304#Outstanding Design Lab!|Brenda, Rich - I've been fortunate enough to have participated in multiple workshops/design labs with you both. However, what never ceases to amaze me is the customer reaction to your delivery of our content. It happened again with Aviva's Design Lab. Such is the absolute confidence (in a humble & respectful way) in your knowledge, that you virtually had the customer wrapped around your fingers. They were completely engaged with what you were saying, asking questions, challenging previously held beliefs and looking for your guidance and validation. At every step you impressed. Thank you for bringing your best to this meeting and for setting Aviva up for success!\n\n305#Finely Tuned Talk Track|Belated congratulations to you, Rich, on facilitating a successful Design Lab with Aviva last Friday. It would've been success enough to have smoothly managed around the variety of curveballs thrown into the mix. But you delivered so much more than that by seizing the opportunity to be strategic and thoughtful at every turn. Something that particularly stood out to me was how you framed the way you guide customers through the decision-making process. You described it as a three-step process where you start first with the business goals we're trying to achieve and the user experience we want to create before considering policy-related factors and finally technical capabilities. I'm paraphrasing, so the words aren't as eloquent as yours. Whatever the exact wording, it was brilliant! The essence of your message is something we're all intimately familiar with across Customer Success and S&C - the need to keep the customers' thinking elevated....no surprise there....it's what we do! But I've never heard the guidance stated quite so succinctly, clearly and elegantly. It was a great example of your Respect for Quality in fine tuning the words that matter for optimal impact. I will absolutely repurpose this little gem of a talk track - thank you! As much as I love all the customer goodness that a Design Lab experience delivers, it's extra special when we come away having learned something so valuable from our own colleagues.\n\n306#Lam Grand Slam|Rich, I heard your call with your new friends at Lam yesterday. Right off the bat in the first weekly call you got questions about SOLI / equitable experiences and markup. I think there were a few other curveballs thrown in there as well. It's not easy to take questions like this, especially when you are just starting to get to know the team and build a relationship with them. You handled the questions with professionalism and grace and knocked it out of the park. (Do you like my baseball references? It feels like spring training today) This is obviously not your first time around but hearing your messaging during these difficult conversations is always a great learning experience for me.\n\n307#Design Lab Direction Leaders|The value that different perspectives and cultures bring to an organization, is our stated reason for a \"Respect for All\" award.  When thinking about the job you two did in our Tuesday Design Lab with Lam, it perfectly summarizes what you did and the fabulous start you have given to our new client.  With 28 people either in the room or on the phone, it was a huge amount to manage.  Throughout the day you both deftly navigated all the complexities of making sure everyone was heard while moving the discussion forward, accomplishing our objectives and landing at a place where everyone felt heard and great about the outcome!  It was literally a master class delivered by two pro's pros!  As proof, at dinner Lam's Global Head of Total Rewards marveled at the amazing job that was done throughout the day and how confident she felt about our team’s complete command of all things recognition related.  I could go on but the impact was nicely summarized by their HRIS project lead who's follow up note simply said; \"I've worked with several vendors in the past and you definitely stand out in the expertise and the service excellence you bring to the table, thank you!\"    Lauren and Rich, I add our collective Thank You!\n\n308#Moments that Matter mindset|Rich, you are no stranger to embracing new ideas and initiatives OR thinking up your own. When I saw this example posted in the MTM slack channel I was not surprised in the least. I absolutely love what you are doing and that you shared it for others to see and try if they would like. This is the reason for the channel! We want to inspire others to take small, simple actions that further their human connections and change the trajectory of a day. Moments that matter do not need to be confetti falling from the sky or bottles of champagne spraying in celebration! They are moments when you can pause the quick shuffle of life and have a laugh with another human. The AstraZeneca team is likely looking forward to what you will surprise them with next. (No pressure!). I love love that you thought to lighten the mood before kicking off testing - a time known in the journey to be a bit stressful. How do we clone your mindset Rich? Thank you for being a great example to others internally and also for being so amazing to our customers! #momentsthatmatter\n\n309#Beyond Status Quo|Thank you for embracing a new idea in Customer Success and diving right into the newest concept of knowledge refreshers with a quiz on \"Use By Date\" previously referred to Award Expiration. Sophia and Tiffany special call out to you both for being the first two to take this quiz! Rich-although timing didn't align with the Launch team, as you were all at an offsite when we deployed this quiz, I wanted to thank you for being the first from Launch to complete the quiz! Steve-thank you for taking additional time to share your talk track that has resonated with customers previously! I will be adding this to my key concepts document on the award expiration/use by date section. I am excited to be in this role and support the team with knowledge sharing and development! Thanks for your eagerness to learn!\n\n310#Re-Launching OpenText Voyagers|Rich, I can't thank you enough for your help and support on OpenText's relaunch! I was so proud to be able to work on this project with you. You have been an amazing support - an ear to listen and a mentor to offer strategic advice - throughout the project. You were so helpful in solutioning a number of features, especially Spend Management, to fit in with OpenText's unique needs. And speaking of, thank you for explaining their Spend Management configuration to me until I finally understood it. I truly appreciate the way you drop everything (and I know how busy you are!) to help strategize a conversation or look at a technical issue or answer a quick question. Sandra McLellan, VP of Total Rewards, also commented on how wonderful you are to work with and was always excited to hear your voice when you joined calls. I know they are set up for success because of your hand in the project!\n\n311#Launching into 2020|Thanks to each of you for bringing your best selves to our offsite. We came together to be vulnerable, share experiences and strategies to move our team and processes forward for efficiencies.  Thank you for your commitment to excellence for ourselves and our customers!\n\n312#Brainstorming Brilliance!|I wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you all for participating in the brainstorming sessions we have been having around user personas and jobs to be done for Reporting! You have dedicated your time and energy to providing me with valuable input needed to enable the Product team to design role-based reporting capabilities that meet a broad and vast set of customers' needs. Given our one-session brainstorm turned into a three-session brainstorm, the complexity of this topic is undeniable; and I appreciate that you have engaged so fully in working through it with me. Your efforts are going to have a direct, positive effect on Product's ability to build the features and functionality that will truly help a wide variety of our customers. I look forward to continuing to expand the collaborative partnership we kicked off through this exercise. Thank you!\n\n313#It takes a village|Thank you for your preparation and support for AZ’s Dublin visit on Tuesday. The customer left very positive and with stronger connections to Workhuman thanks to all of the effort and collaboration in the background. Starting with a warm welcome, a parking space!, and delicious food, thank you Dympna for setting this day up for success. Thank you to our presenters - Jesse, for wooing the customer with the data. Claire later expressed how ahead we are with our analytics and appreciative she was for the guidance to help her ask the right questions. Chris & Sarah, leading some tough conversations, sharing best practices, challenging their preconceptions and highlighting the knowledge and expertise Workhuman has accumulated to lead this space. Outcome TBC, thank you for ensuring we put our best foot forward for them to make a well-informed decision. Rosette, you have set strong foundations as a trusted advisor. Claire mentioned finding the silver thread to pull all of the pieces of employee experience together on performance, L&D, reward and recognition and I believe we are strongly positioned to take this forward. Grant, always thinking two steps ahead and finding solutions. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and build this partnership. Good things to come! Jim, the customer went as far as saying she has zero concerns in our ability to deliver. Thank you for showcasing just what we can do, and the honesty in admitting we may not always get it right but we are always at hand to make it right. To everyone behind the presenters, Nick, Shane, Megan and Clare. Your spirits shone through and the slides were on point. Finally the day to day team making this program great – Joyce, Rich and Kieran you have built very strong relationships with the customer truly setting strong foundations for success. Thank you! And finally Lynette & James for bringing the whole day together. It’s an honour to work with and learn from you both!\n\n314#You have 3 minutes…why Workhuman?|“You’re at a networking event, have just met the CHRO of one of our top prospects and they ask YOU why they should take a meeting with Workhuman, what could we do for her company?” Ignite Solutions Team 7, thank you for coming together during the workshop on Wednesday morning. You rose to the challenge and came up with a compelling approach: share a personal story, tie it to increased employee engagement & an energized culture, and end with improved customer experience & ROI. You even tackled the extra credit portion (Markup? It’s fully delivered & auditable.) Great teamwork!\n\n315#'Sabre' This Moment of Recognition & Praise!!|This team knows how to Delight Customers! There is no better way to start a Monday than to be reading an email from Yvonne Freeman, VP Global Total Rewards & HR Operations recognizing and praising this team for your efforts leading up to the soon-to-be successful launch of their 'Say Thanks' social recognition program at Sabre! It''s time to pause for a moment and 'sabre' her kind words ... \"You all deserve a giant Thank You for everything you’ve done to get us to this point, and for what I know will be a successful launch.  The vision we created together at the request of our team members and leadership is coming to life and we couldn’t be more excited or grateful to see it happen!\" So I’d like to “Say Thanks” to all of you, Yvonne. That's pure gratitude and praise coming through in her words! Setting customers up for success is in all of your DNA's. Each and everyone one of you played an instrumental role from pre-contract through ready for launch! You Rock!!\n\n316#Bring on the Laugh Factory|Rich, I had to call out your adept handling of client calls. We've had some tense moments with one of our clients in particular, but on our most recent call, you broke the ice and had them smiling by sharing your screen and starting with a cute baby picture (although it had me scratching my head since it was a baby girl!) You made a reference to being proactive in discussions so no one's left pulling their hair at the last minute - that's how you ended up being bald! That also got another round of laughs from the team. Subsequently, I ended up hearing my first joke from their side of the team in regards to deploying emails by the \"following Santa\" approach. These little tactics go a long way in building rapport with client teams, especially over teleconferencing.\n\n317#Yes and has come to life...|Team, I know it is difficult to take two mornings out of your week while you have Customer calls, emails and launches happening to attend a knowledge share workshop on some of our trickiest topics.  I must say it was impressive to see everyone sharing their experiences and knowledge building upon each other thoughts.  The collaboration among such a diverse group of people and roles  was simply amazing to be a part of and witness among a group of 40 strong.  If you were wondering what Respect for All looks like...you were just a part of it and each of you made it happen!  I would be remiss without calling out your contribution to moments that matter by agreeing to be present in our workshop and any other meeting moving forward.  We all know how it feels when someone/s is multi-tasks and I was so pleased to see laptops closed and true focus and attention on the subject and task at hand.  Thank you all for a great two days, I cannot wait to see what this Team does next.\n\n318#Tool Requirements|I wanted to thank you all for your thoughtful contributions for our implementation tool requirements, not only from the requirement aspects but from the approach on how to weight, evaluate the solutions and for embracing any mindset changes. I love how we are aligned on the needs of our team to continue to make us better and for a better customer experience!\n\n319#Great teamwork!|Rich and Shawn I wanted to say thanks to both of you for taking some time to review the new Branding confluence pages we are working on. The aim of these pages is to improve communication of the Branding process for new hires and also those with other general Branding questions. For this reason getting the content right is key. You both took the time to review what we had so far - and to give us a few excellent suggestions. Your input will definitely benefit others - so thank you! Great teamwork!\n\n320#Coverage extraordinares|Thank you both for covering 8x8, OpenText, and NCR for the past two plus weeks while I was on leave. Going through my emails, I am so grateful to see that each of my clients continued to have amazing support in my absence. From Recognition Tips questions, to SSO configuration, to project timing changes, everything was covered and under control. I really appreciate your support and teamwork so I could enjoy the holidays with my family!\n\n321#Great partners!|Hello everyone. I wanted to take a minute and thank all of you for your great team work in 2019. I see our teams as very much a partnership and I think I can speak for all of Branding when I say that as partners go - you guys are fantastic. It’s been a very busy year - with a few challenging moments - but through our collective passion, drive and determination we have delivered excellence for all our customers. I wanted to thank you all for the hard work and to wish you all happy holidays. I look forward to continuing our partnership and collaboration in 2020! Cheers!\n\n322#The right team for the job|Thank you so much for stepping up to manage The Hartford's Workday file testing and the set up of all of their eligibility rules from multiple data files to a single employee data file. When I started this project it seemed straightforward - test an eligibility file and send a test payroll back to the client. Wrong! There were learnings at every turn... you can't test a single file if sandbox expects multiple files... a file needs to actually have a .pgp extension on it even it if it is encrypted. You name it! You both came up with creative solutions of how to move the project forward despite challenges. I especially appreciate how responsive you were to me and to The Hartford as we move them forward in to the next round of testing. It is no secret that I have had a lot on my plate and having you both support this initiative has been helpful beyond measure. Thank you!\n\n323#Orchestrating the moving parts|Rich, I wanted to give a shout out for how you have been orchestrating all the moving parts and engaging with the different departments to get AZ ready for their mini UAT. It was a crucial milestone for the smaller team to go back to senior leadership to confirm a functional site before the holidays. Great job being on top of the tasks and dates, and determining an approach for the redemption site proactively thinking about the downstream impacts.\n\n324#All together we succeed|Everyone, I wanted to recognise each of you for all you do when helping out the production support team. It has been another busy year, I for one cannot thank you all enough for everything you do to help out team out. There are countless small things that you all do that really make working here easier. There are countless things that are greatly appreciated and for those things I want to recognise you all. I still find it amazing how despite working across an ocean we have such a great comradery, friendship and can share laughs. I find it phenomenal just how much work we get through and the things we can achieve working side by side are incredible. No matter what we get the support we need and I know that together our team can give our customers a truly world class experience. Thank you all for being you and the teamwork you have displayed over the year. You are all the best :D\n\n325#Thank You!|Rich; thanks again for immediately jumping in (seriously, within minutes!), when the SNCL team asked us to address a UAT login question. You took the time to diagnose the root issue, and then reached out to ensure accurate information would be communicated - AND you absolutely went above and beyond to send updated UAT info, and a thorough summary, directly to the client. Thanks for keeping this critical launch stage on track - you're a fantastic teammate and always keeping our customers in focus!\n\n326#High Praise indeed!|Rich, this award is on behalf of Claire Whieldon, Global Rewards Programme Director, at AstraZeneca. I was chatting with Claire last week and again this week and on both occasions, she said to me, \"I really wish I could recognise Rich for the FANTASTIC job he did during the recent workshop\". Claire explained that you had led a very detailed and long demo, addressing endless questions from a wide selection of stakeholders across AZ. Not only that, you were supposed to be off and enjoying family time, as it was the US Thanksgiving holidays! On the second call with Claire, she reiterated that you had done an 'Awesome job!'...not a very UK phase I might add :-), so I consider this high praise indeed! Thank you Rich, your dedication and professionalism is greatly appreciated both internally and externally!\n\n327#Cheers to a great design lab!|see what I did there? Let's hope they go with that program name :) I just wanted to say thank you for putting together such a great design lab for NCR yesterday. It was also my first onsite design lab and you all made me feel so comfortable! Even from our first prep meeting, you all made sure that I felt like I had a part in the design lab and I am so grateful for that! I cant wait to see this program take off its going to be a fun one!\n\n328#Let us REJOICE! Sabre is in UAT (testing)!!|Rich, congratulations on reaching A HUGE milestone today---sending SABRE into UAT (testing). Sabre is so excited and in need of gratitude within their organization and it took a lot to get us to testing. You have guided (and herded) this team, worked with their complex internal meeting structure, and persevered from day 1.  They came with a huge ask....to not let them Sabre-ize things (meaning, don't let them overthink it or add too much red tape) and we have spoken up several times to deliver just that---and uncomplicate things. You have been a great partner for them and today is a HUGE milestone for this customer and for us as a team. And according to my records, this is our 18th customer together!\n\n329#GE Healthcare Success!|Rich! I just wanted to say thank you for leading all of the technical components of GE Healthcares program relaunch ! 60k+ healthcare employees now have the social feed on, media on, and multiple programs in use to give them the ability to nominate for healthcare specific award levels and core values. You went above and beyond in investigating solutions for various out of the box asks the client had, ensured everything was configured, proofed and was pushed live successfully. This is such a big step in the right direction with GE and having this relaunch go off with out a hitch just reaffirms the confidence the GE team has in us and this direction!\n\n330#Making an Impact on GE's culture!|Congrats team on a successful launch of GE Healthcare's new \"Impact\" program!  Rich, Traci, Kara, you all played an integral part in the success of this launch.  Rich, your attention to detail, organization and project management skills are super impressive and the GE team thoroughly enjoyed working with you.  Traci, omg you are simply amazing. Your creative mind blows me away.  You knew just how to manage this geographically diverse team, offer the right advice, at the right time and package it up in a way that made it easy for GE to execute on. Kara, what can I say...you are the glue that holds this team together.  You manage this program and all of the technical details like a champ and you are so great at connecting the dots to the overall strategic plan.  You have all been key to this initiative and all that we have been working towards to help GE re-imagine culture transformation powered by a world class recognition program!  I'm so excited about where we are at on this journey with GE and what the future holds. One thing I'm sure of is that I am grateful that we are on this journey together.  Great work!!\n\n331#Elanco Migration to Workday|Rich, thank you for all of your assistance with Elanco's migration to Workday.  They've thrown a few challenges our way during the process...such as telling us in November that their go-live date was actually this month as opposed to the Q1 timeframe we were working towards, or the move to 2 payroll files in order to account for Lilly's payroll process, or the last minute issue with preceeding zeros, or the issues with testing the data file on our end etc.  Through it all, you were a huge help to me in running with this migration and I really appreciate the effort and same level of commitment as if Elanco was still one of your customer launches. Thank you!\n\n332#Commitment - even on the weekend|It’s a little known fact that you’ve been logging on every Sunday to execute a specific, data lake request for British Airways for the last 4 months. The delay in productization of this item meant we still needed to hit the client commitment. I thank you for interrupting your personal time on the weekend to ensure we meet the client’s need. Your eye is always on the customer and their success!\n\n333#Strategic positioning and personal examples|Rich, thank you for taking the lead yesterday with the conversation on Amazon with our customer. With lots of moving parts and parallel conversations still happening with sales, you took the opportunity to clearly describe best practice recommendations, backed up with the importance on user experience. I loved your own personal example on redemption and the long term feeling that had. Then you beautifully tied it back to a better return on the company's investment - business results! I really appreciate your partnership in setting this customer up for success and keeping the wider team informed of all the important elements in play. Thank You!\n\n334#Thank You!|Rich; sincere thanks for helping me work through a profoundly puzzling series of configuration questions and workflows. We're addressing a time sensitive client issue, and you've proven yourself yet again to be a confident, knowledgeable, and thoughtful teammate. I've appreciated your guidance and patience, and thank you for your support!\n\n335#Payroll File: Party of 11|Thank you Rich for walking through the process of creating multiple payroll files. In theory, the process would be that would we would clone the file and move forward however you provided the insight of the right questions to ask the client and considerations to make before the cloning process.  As always, you have a wealth of knowledge who is ready to share.\n\n336#Leading AZ to good decisions|Rich, thank you for leading AZ in a 3 & a half hour conversation on the design of their program, eligibility, approvals and a wide range of topics, including a detailed award advisor design & measurement conversation.  Lynette you did a fantastic job on level setting in some key areas, speaking to the importance of offboarding, onboarding, soft expiry of points and many more key areas. This time was well spent in showing the customer the level of detail and expertise their support team has & your knowledge & experience shined through every step of the way - great work & thank you!\n\n337#Resideo Exec Sponsor Praise|Resideo is launched and the first thing the Executive Sponsor, Erich Barnes, does is praise you on the launch. “If you were eligible, you would get the first Signature Award. ?  In any case, thanks for demonstrating all four of our energies. You are one of the best implementation leaders who I have worked with. Great job and thanks for the support.” Then, Sue Hansen, the PM also jumped on the opportunity to shine about you. “Rich, a big thank you for your work these last couple of days before we went live. We appreciate all you did to get us up and running this morning....Thank you so much for all you did to get us to this point. We really appreciate your help and perseverance. As Erich said this morning, you have demonstrated all four Energies these past couple of days!” There is no doubt you embraced their four energies of Breakout Innovators, Driven by Purpose, High Velocity Operators, Vested in Our People in the days leading up to launch working through some last minute items, but also throughout the entire launch process. Congratulations on launching Resideo and bravo to the wonderful customer sentiments!\n\n338#Unileverage your expertise|Thank you to you both for your assistance during the Unilever launch.  Given the timeline, there needed to be quick turnaround on questions on capabilities and requests.  You both were always open to questions or quick brainstorming sessions on what we could accomplish.  Your genuine interest in the launch and your support offered has helped with learning more about how the product works and what we are capable of.  Thank you!\n\n339#Working Magic to retain an important CDN Client!|Ten months ago we were invited to participate in an evaluation with existing customer Open Text.  From the get go it was clear this wasn't going to be an easy deal to win, let alone retain our existing business with them.  Facing a new leadership team that has preconceived (and unfounded) notions of who Workhuman was, they told us flat out our chances were slim.  An organization who's entire livelihood is made selling extension software solutions to SAP ERP customers, we had fierce competition from SAP/Successfactors.  In the end this team rallied together and you ALL helped us prevail.   It was so important that we retain this customer, and win the new R&R deal.  Now OpenText is currently our most important Canadian HQ customer, with the largest spend annually.      THANK YOU!\n\n340#Shawn and I...|Rich, as we kick off OpenText together, I want to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciated you reassuring the team that the two of us will be tackling their requirements together, especially as we shift the account more onto my workload, and doubly especially with the amount of transition they have endured in the past. It was empowering hearing your confidence in our tag team approach. I'm so excited to work on this account with you and with the OpenText team. Thanks for always being a great teammate and sounding board!\n\n341#'Healthy' Start to Day! Design Lab w/GE Healthcare|I am go grateful to be a apart of this amazing team taking 15 years with GE to the next level of greatness and true imagination at work, Workhuman style! Sheri, our strategic leader and thinker. GE is experiencing lots of business challenges. You continue to position the WH Cloud as a critical component for culture transformation, modern day leadership, exceptional employee experience and connectedness which translates directly into talent and business outcomes! Getting GE Healthcare to think 'Quick, Impactful WINS, in the short-term and Bolder, Bigger WINS post-Workday launch.' You educate on what's possible. Last week Kostas said 'I love the microsite you created. Lots of valuable information in there.' Talk about getting a new heartbeat at Healthcare! Kara, you continue to shine with your deep knowledge and expertise around the platform, out of the box thinking on what's possible in the short-term and always strategizing on the long-term goals. Your demo today, the added color, story you were telling was so impactful. Greg, after a 4:30am start to drive 3 hours, your presence alone up-levels any meeting (the Dr  is in the house) ,you presented Healthcare's data, what story it told, highlighting the opportunities, showcasing what great looks like, weaving in other customer stories had them coming to all the right conclusions - mindset change is needed. More peer to peer recognition, managers and peers, giving and receiving at about 1 per month resonated well! All of our voices will be in there heads tonight hearing \"lower value awards given more frequently.\" The most beautiful cheer of all! Rich, you jumped in at the last minute to listen and learn as the recently assigned launch manager. We truly appreciated the behind the scenes support! Lots of WINS today. Award reasons that matter, mindset change program is for everyday efforts, both big and small, increase in investment, proper comms rollout strategy and continued excitement!! New Life, New Heart!\n\n342#Squats Baby!|When I think of this team, the first thing that comes to mind is Resilience. A close second is Gyshido ;)  You take every customer, every launch, every project to heart to ensure the best experience for the customer and their employees. What others don’t see is that you take on every new project or task with a positive approach and attitude. Are you maxed out with the added workload – yes! Are you constantly prioritizing and re-prioritizing tasks against different customer timelines – yes! Do you have ridiculous customer complexities that are unfathomable – yes! Are you stressed – double yes! Are you trying to help your teammates and colleagues while getting your own work done – yes! Are you balancing work and home – ok…this could be an iffy, lol! But, I see each one of you giving it your best every single day.  I thought this image was awesome because you carry the weight of our customers on your shoulders and you simply just crush it. This team is why I come to work - you all inspire me!\n\n343#I spy with my little eye|I spy with my little eye a great process enhancement you proactively shared with the Technical Specialists team. The small but mighty addition of putting the Jira link into the comments of the task will be both timely and efficient. It allows the LSM to have all the information in one place should you have the need to re-review the details. It’s these nuggets that will continue to make us efficient and I can’t wait for the next one!\n\n344#Conquering Cambridge!|Ok, so we didn't have time for a punt, but we did have an incredibly successful Design Lab with our friends in Cambridge! A huge thank you to each of you for taking planes, trains and buses to a not so easy to get to 2 days of meetings. While everyone's delivery, content, knowledge and energy levels were confidence inspiring, I wanted to give a special call out to Lynette, Rich and Kylie for leading proceedings and for a top notch performance - thank you!! Clearly this is only just the beginning of what will be a long and fruitful partnership, but we're off to a very strong start and that is down to this team.\n\n345#Thank You!|Rich; THANK YOU for all of your coverage and support in the past week. You kept everything up to date so well that it feels like I was never gone. I know what a busy schedule you have, and I really appreciate that you took the time to make every launch feel well supported during my time away. Thanks for addressing countless ad hoc questions regarding redemption, gross-up, approval process, SOLI, + too many to list - you helped move along some key decisions with your thoughtful and professional replies. You also closed the loop completely on Allscripts' file transfer issue and guaranteed they would have a successful August launch. This was a major task, and required extensive coordination with leadership, production support, and customer success teammates. I’m extremely fortunate to have you as a colleague - thanks for doing such an outstanding job!\n\n346#Massive Thank You from BA|Well done Rich, Lynette & Kylie on the recent BA launch, we've just received an email from Zoe the PM with the title \"Massive Thank You\" where she calls out the wonderful support from each of you.   Rich, you are described as \"been an absolute superstar, your knowledge and understanding of the platform is incredible and you’re always on hand to offer support and guidance (even outside of your working hours). You have been truly instrumental in what has been a very successful launch.\"   Lynette \"your passion and enthusiasm is completely contagious and your continued support in how we re-energise recognition at BA makes me very excited for the future.\" And Kylie, \"you are our go to for all things weird and wonderful, no question is every too stupid and no request is ever too much trouble. Whether it’s a quick phone call or exchange of emails we can always rely on you.\" You are each aware of how much went into this and I am so delighted to have Zoe be so effusive in her praise & it's hugely deserved, well done & thank you!!\n\n347#The more you know...|Rich, thank you for taking time out of your day to walk through a complex program structure proposal a client sent over prior to meeting with them!  You listened to my questions and concerns then made recommendations on what to add to the program structure to enhance what they were looking to do, how I would need to set it up (volunteering to help when the times comes) and what questions to ask just to clarify items.  On the call, I felt fully prepared to answer their questions, ask questions to them and make recommendations to their program which they completely agreed with.  I appreciate the teamwork!\n\n348#time to zoom in|Thank you all for the recent contributions you made in implementing zoom! Lauren thank you for coming with the recommendation and contact for Zoom, none of this would have happened without you. Jonathan, Dante for your support and direction on the project, Christie for you tireless drive on the contract negotiations and getting this completed in time,  Steve for approving the Spend, Eoin & Jamesley for the support in getting the trial up and running, supporting the users during this time and most importantly everyone else who participated in the Zoom trial and gave the Honest and positive feedback on Zoom which made everyone else’s efforts worthwhile.  This was a true team effort and we are now positioned with a best in class conferencing system going forward to help and support the company’s efforts to reach its goals! Thank you all for your patience while this process was closed out.\n\n349#Above & Beyond for British Airways|Rich - Congratulations on the launch of British Airways! I cannot thank you enough for stepping up to the plate on this client when I had to move onto a new project. This was no regular launch. British Airways is a huge brand with high expectations and countless requests, many of which that go beyond the norm. You met this challenge with your usual determination and tenacity and delivered to the client having them launch on time for August 1st. You are such a tremendous team mate and I appreciate your willingness to take over a complex project and drive it to the finish line. This is really one you should celebrate and be proud of! Great work as always and congratulations again.\n\n350#On the bench, but contributing|Rich, though you were not able to be physically present in the session, your presence was felt and appreciated.  You set the tone before the meeting and were a big part of a reason the call went so well.  Your commitment to the launch of Sabre has been evident to all.  thank you for being part of the team. It has been an honor to work with you so far.\n\n351#Amazing Strength!|There are days I’m amazed at where your strength comes from! Regardless of the client situation, program aspects changing mid-call (not in a good way), program managers driving the crazy train to changing your vacation plans to ensure you are at a critical client meeting in Dublin…mind you, that travel is on top existing travel for a design lab. You are always so calm in your reactions when speaking to the client, while you may be thinking QUITE the opposite to yourself. Then add today where you are already back at work after unexpectedly being out. Your determination and strength to push through any situation to be your best for this company and your clients is truly amazing. But more importantly, you are being true to yourself and giving your whole self. Thank you for being you!\n\n352#Thank You!|Rich; without hesitation, you jumped in to help me with a challenging SOLI conversations with a customer. Everything's worked out thanks to your attention to detail, reading through a complex situation, and willingness to dig in to another teammate's customer story. You frequently provide great insight whenever I (or others) encounter anything unfamiliar, but your support in this case was critical to the positive outcome we achieved. Thank you for being a fantastic teammate!\n\n353#Customer Success Offsite 2019!!|What an amazing and talented team we have in Customer Success! I am so proud of everything we've accomplished as a team over the past quarter. Thank you Liz, Laura, and Michelle for your creativity and flawless execution of the event from beginning to end - you made the event FUN with odd activities and that was exactly what we needed! Robin and Sharon, thank you for your continued support - your workshop helped the team immensely on how to effectively manage change and it was very well received. Eric - the team was so inspired by your session that they kicked off the Gratitude Movement beyond the Workplace at Foxwoods itself (see video)! And thank you to the entire Customer Success team for your active engagement and contribution throughout the event - this event was special because of YOU, and I am so grateful that we are a team!! Thank you, All...\n\n354#Teeing up the next phase of Be HaPi.|It was a fast and furious push to launch our local friends, Harvard Pilgrim, from an eThanks only program to one with points awards and YOS soon to come! Be HaPi.'s program manager was seeking onsite help with their phase 2 mini-golf launch events at their main Quincy and Wellesley locations. Scott, Iveta and Sarah, thanks so much for stepping in to staff their Wellesley launch event, especially with their CHRO and executive sponsor onsite at that location. Scott, you were the voice of experience onsite and had no trouble continuing to build upon the strong relationship with Anastasia, and look to the future to secure more budget for the program. Iveta and Sarah, thanks for bringing your can-do attitude and energy to your first launch event!  Ashley, it was so nice to see your hard work come to life in the launch events, from seeing the digital signage running throughout their facilities and posters by the launch events. Iveta, extra thanks to stepping in and making some last minute changes to HP's visual assets while Ashley was on vacation. Rich, I think it was pretty much 40 days from start to finish to get this latest phase of Be HaPi. running. You were our man behind the scenes, answering questions and trouble-shooting Jonathan's mobile app access attempts. I know Jonathan was very appreciative of Workhuman's collaborative efforts to promote the program and remarked that he was already deeming the launch a success based on the activity he's seeing in the platform.\n\n355#Building relationships with BA|Team thank you for your important contribution to the BA meeting in Dublin today.  It was lovely to welcome Zoe to our office and be able to spend time speaking about the impact recognition can have at BA, understand her areas of focus and build a stronger connection in how we work together.  Kylie thank you for leading the way on this, building the agenda/slides and engaging with the relevant teams to ensure rich content & having the right people join the meeting. It was great to hear you share insights from others and speak to how we can work together.  Rich we appreciate you joining us in person for this meeting and leading the way in discussing all launch related items, from data expertise to guidance on birthday awards & so much more. It was great to hear you position Zoe for success for August 1 & I know she really valued meeting you in person. James thank you continuing the relationship with BA and joining this meeting. It was worthwhile to have you present a full overview of the solution while sharing the story of the contract process.  Frank, thank you for joining the meeting and showing Zoe our ecomm capability on mobile and what's coming.  Kurt it was helpful having you present the options available for anniversary pins and address any questions. Finally Traci, thank you for joining this meeting while Lynette is on vacation to share some key examples and show we are here to support BA each step of the way.  Great team collaboration from everyone & it's really appreciated!\n\n356#Expressing GRATITUDE to GIVERS!!!|Hello GRATEFUL Humans!! A grateful HEART is a magnet for magical, memorable moments! And that's exactly what each of you did for your colleagues this week! When the 'ask' came to share your gratitude to GIVERS of recognition moments you received, you jumped right in, created short, personal and memorable videos that were shared with all during the recent Solution Consulting, Strategy & Consulting and WARI teams offsite!   The expressions of surprise, delight and joy on the individual GIVERS face as well as every participant alike, was just simply priceless as the videos were revealed throughout the 1 and 1/2 days. Everyone was touched by your expressions of gratitude for the givers - cementing our Gratitude Movement point - positivity reigns when humans are involved in BOTH giving and receiving recognition!! Thank you for helping me create elements of surprise and delight for the offsite, being tremendously generous humans with your time and showcasing the power of gratitude! You all ROCK!!\n\n357#Keeping in true...|Rich, thank you for your numerous recent inquiries about elements of various product documentation - Work Circles, Workday, Data File specs. Your questions and input have led to better quality documentation - revisions to ensure clarity and content corrections. You always offer out good open questions asking for elements to be looked into, provide constructive advice, and then appreciate when updates are made. And those then benefit all who use the documents - internal and external to Workhuman.\n\n358#Making Harvard Pilgrim HaPi|Team, we made the most of three hours that we had Harvard Pilgrim's new program manager onsite to discuss the big changes coming to \"Be HaPi\". Rich, I'm always appreciative your organized and thoughtful approach to every customer engagement, which held true for this mini Design-Lab session. From getting Jonathan onsite (so he could glean ideas for a HP revamp of their Quincy office space) to masterfully guiding the conversation past any speed bumps (let's nip that idea in the bud to allocate points per employee), I know Jonathan felt like we were hearing his needs while also provide best practice guidance. Sam, you shone in your role as CSM, making the most of the relationship you have with HP. I loved your color commentary throughout the discussion, you were able to cite things in their existing program and raise good points for them to consider in how the approach things like spend management, and sharing personal stories to bring the program to life. Scott, the fact that we're at phase 2 with HP (phase 1 only being e-Thanks only) is a testament to the trust you've built with HP. As I told Rich, we built Be HaPi. with the thought they would definitely be expanding to a fully funded recognition and YOS program, and you've brought that to fruition. Along the way, you've also kept us updated so we know what we were walking into. It is a testament to the team's efforts that Jonathan ended the meeting by saying he felt confident that we would give them the program they want to achieve the best-practice recognition culture. Full speed ahead!\n\n359#We do what...|Team, I cannot thank you enough for spending half a day to help Customer Success document the current state of our process from future Customer (prospect) all the way through ongoing management of a customer. Without each of your help, insights and expertise we would not have been able to visualize the work that is being done today on a 10’ by 6’ flow chart. As you know, this is a critical step to ensure we do not break up or downstream processes across various organizations as we reimagined how work is done in Customer Success in the future. I think we all learned so much about each other and the functions we support. Thank you again for your time, attention to detail and helping set us on a course to drive more efficient and effective systems and processes for all to take advantage of in the future. Great work Team!!!!\n\n360#Keeping it real for Unisys|Rich - great job walking Unisys through spend management today to ease any of their budget concerns. The way you phrased everything made it very easy to understand and relatable. I know they appreciated the conversation on this and how easy you made it look.\n\n361#Thanks for the support|Thanks for the on-site support during today's training session. I figured we'd run into some issues with the conference rooms and there's not much I can do when working remotely. I asked for help in advance and you all agreed. One room worked out fine and the other....well....it needed some fine-tuning. Thanks for your patience and problem-solving, we started and ended on time!  Thanks again!\n\n362#Pure gold metrics|When I was sharing some thoughts on our Time To Revenue project, you offered up a little (ok big) piece of data that is so insightful in the current review process. You've been tracking on your own since you started, different time elements of the launch process to clearly show the variance of customer decisions times against different key areas. We can use this to focus on those areas and determine alternate ways to improve the completion times, internally and externally. You always have little nuggets and this nugget is pure gold!\n\n363#Taming the Bull!|Rich - Thanks for taking the time to go over every aspect for Nasdaq's upcoming launch! It's easy to get motivated for the week when I hear you in your element first thing Monday morning, especially when it's clear that Nasdaq values your guidance and expertise. I continue to learn from you on a daily basis and appreciate you making time with me to go over (and over) each actionable agenda item. Nasdaq is without a doubt set up for success - and here's to Never Allowing Stuff to Derail A Success!\n\n364#Inpowering Innio|Your fantastic teamwork and support for this client has been called out by the program manager and program team on so many occasions over the last number of weeks as the client was coming to launch, so huge well done and thank you for that, it’s not specifically the launch I am calling out here but it’s the rallying together as the client becomes more anxious about the budget of the program. Thank you both for coming together in the last number of days (and in the weeks coming to launch) to help guide this client on the best way forward in order for them to be as successful as possible with very limited resources, it’s great to work with you both and thank you for living our team work value!\n\n365#CIL and Excel Expert|Rich, I knew you had just finished a long day at a design lab and still I decided to send you an excel sheet to figure out why the formulas weren't working. Thanks not only for taking a look at the formula, but telling me the actions to correct it, and then the follow up that needs to be done with the customer. I know you had a busy, probably stressful day so I appreciate the time you took to look at this with me!\n\n366#Launch...success!|Today's call with our new customer was very well executed. Being my first launch call with you, as a fly on the wall, I appreciated how prepared you were and how clearly you spoke and explained steps to the customer; consistently checking in for understanding. Your thorough approach paired with controlled and relaxed language made the call go very smoothly and helped keep us on track throughout--bravo!\n\n367#Lounge Lizards|Thank you all so much for your hard work and customer delight in the lounge this year! I just knew you were all the best humans for the role and you did not disappoint. From managing the room, being on time, setting up raffles, answering questions all the way to sourcing additional bottles of water - you are all rock stars. Thanks for making this the best year of the lounge to date! Our customers appreciate you and so do I.\n\n368#Great Teamwork!|Rich; thanks for joining and contributing to such a welcoming and productive conversation with Leslie and Austin from DFS. Leslie sent me a message after the Wild Horse event, thrilled to have met us both and more excited than ever for their launch. Thanks for being a great teammate and sharing your wisdom with new customers!\n\n369#Nasdaq-olades to the Nasdaq Design Lab team|While My Thanks was their agreed upon program name, I really got a kick out of Nasdaqolades! It was great to see the team in action, interacting with the Nasdaq team and showcasing our knowledge, experience and talent. I'm confident they came away with a great sense of the partnership and how the program will benefit them. And it doesn't hurt to have someone like Rebecca championing our cause! I truly believe this can become one the best programs we have and a big thanks goes out to each of you!\n\n370#Great Design Lab|Hi Rich - Thanks so much for including me in the Nasdaq Design Lab.  I've been hoping for more opportunities to participate in prospect and customer activities and you were generous enough to remember that and include me when an opportunity presented itself.  It was a great learning experience for me and I appreciate being included.  The Globoforce team did a great job handling a changing agenda and demonstrated the qualities that make a good partner.  Thank you!\n\n371#Launching into 2019|Thank you team, for a fantastic offsite as we had a 2018 year in review and then a look towards 2019. You all brought your whole selves on self reflection, process improvements, customer relationships and management and personal growth. I’m excited for the year ahead and the strides we’ll make as a team to be the best yet! I love being a part of this team.  And a special thanks to Shawn...for your help in the logistics, your design insight and my co-chef!\n\n372#Spend Management Messaging|One of my favorite things about working with you and our team is when I can hear the way you present things and can garner a new insight or way to explain a concept. I am overhearing you talking to a client about Spend Management and I love how you explained the messaging for approvers/managers. I have this conversation with almost every client about how to balance managing the recognition budget with empowering managers to approve awards. I liked how you explained the fact that there are tools in place in the background to monitor the budget but approvers should trust that they can approve an award based on the merit of the contribution. There is nothing new about what you said, but a subtle difference in how you said it...I'll be stealing your words and using them in future conversations. Thank you for the inspiration, Rich!\n\n373#Applause from Travelport|Congrats to you on the launch of Travelport's Applause program! I want to call out the great work from you both even when we lost some of the main project contacts along the way, this didn't phase you, you both continued as you did from day one and kept the program team on track and gearing up for the launch. It's fantastic to hear all the positivity that Applause is creating across their organization and the wonderful feedback from the program team, on both sides of the Atlantic commenting on the great work done by to get the program launched. Thanks very much to you and a big Applause for setting this client up for success.\n\n374#Lonza & Travelport implementations|A massive thanks to you Rich for your leadership with both Lonza & Travelport's implementations. You displayed creativity, patience, deep knowledge and a firm hand at every turn. It's easy to see why you earn the respect of our clients and despite the many hurdles thrown in your direction, you always had a solution. Many thanks for leading both of these clients through successful implementations - I look forward to working with you on many more!\n\n375#Amazonian|Rich, just wanted to call out the great job you did navigating a tough Amazon discussion. The client is an offshoot of GE, so they are accustomed to having Amazon available on the platform. You did a great job steering the client in the right direction so they could make the decision themselves. I was glad to be able to hear your messaging for this!\n\n376#\"Best team\" and a little acceleration|Nothing like an extremely quick launch plan to start the new year! Saia needs to launch by Feb 11 which leaves a month, generously. You had a great idea to go onsite for two days to accelerate the education and the decision making process with hands on workshop sessions. Ginger McElhannon, the Program Owner, said that “ Rich is AWESOME.  He directed the meeting very professionally and for the most part kept us on task.  We are a rowdy bunch.  He was very helpful when asked questions, he would guide us in the direction that we needed, he offered suggestions when we asked and he was very clear with what best practices were.  I didn’t even realize we were meeting for two days, that tells you how productive everything went.” But my favorite comment was, “I know without a shadow of a doubt that we have partnered with the best team.” Great job on this accelerated approach and showing them we are a great partner and not just another vendor!\n\n377#Here to pump YOU up!|Rich and Matt - AKA the Hans and Franz of the Launch team!? All week you guys have helped me gear up for the avalanche of launches by answering my questions, walking me through processes, answering MORE questions, and providing tips and tricks that I wouldn't have picked up only one month in. A big thank you to making my ramp up a fast, fun and well-organized one!\n\n378#Go team!!|Hi everyone. I wanted to take a moment to recognize the fantastic work that you guys have carried out in 2018. This was a very busy year with a lot of big launches - (Dell immediately comes to mind) and I know it was certainly challenging at times! However I feel that due to the strong partnership that exists across our teams, we have delivered excellence consistently for our customers. Speaking for my team, I would like to say that we value all of your hard work and we could not ask for a nicer bunch of people to work hand in hand with. I hope that our partnership continues to grow from strength to strength in 2019 and that our customers continue to benefit from the collective determination shown. Thank you all for a great 2018 and I hope to see you all for a celebratory drink in Dublin in January!  Thanks!\n\n379#Our Amazing J&J Team!|I am extremely proud to call you my team and I know J&J is too! Each of you took the time to prepare for your respective role for the J&J \"Design\" Lab and you all knocked it out of the park.  Chris - while you weren't there in person your thoughts and insights certainly left a lasting mark on the day.  Jen - your executive sponsorship and guidance as a former client and practitioner added a ton of empathy and credibility to the discussion.  Naomi and Erin - your collaboration prior to and your performance day of was absolutely what the J&J team needed; a collaborative, but a guiding voice (you gave them tremendous confidence we know our stuff).  Maggie - great job bringing the branding discussions to life and providing them with lots of creative ideas.  Rich - you executed the technical discussion seamlessly. Meghan and Sophia - you took multiple opportunities to show the value of our CSM model and its team members bring to the partnership. Lisa - great job keeping us on task, ensuring we got through everything which will be key to our success moving forward.  Melissa - thanks for being a keen set of ears and capturing key data points; your readout at the end helped show them we were listening. It was a very high-quality start to the launch process, with great client feedback and I thank each of you for your unique contributions!  THANK YOU Team Get That Bread!\n\n380#J&J dream team|Rich, I am so thankful that we are working together on J&J! Even though it's only been a week, I can already tell we have an amazing partnership and this will lead to a wonderful experience for the client. From strategizing on how to close the design lab out strong to the best way to approach the decision tree they requested, it's extremely helpful to have another opinion and that made me feel super confident going into the meeting on Friday. During the design lab, you did an incredible job leading the Workday data/SSO session. With a bigger group during this part of the meeting and many talkative team members, you were great at managing the room and thinking on your feet to respond to every single item that came up. Even your spur of the moment idea to drive the demo site while I presented the demo went so smoothly and definitely made that section seem more polished. Finally, I can't thank you enough for jumping in for me literally at the last second on Wednesday to meet with Naomi and finalize the plan for the session and the slides when I unexpectedly had to leave the office.  You are such an amazing teammate and I am so excited to have this opportunity to collaborate on a client together.\n\n381#Stock the Sleigh w/ Power of You Service Awards!!!|RICH, YOU DID IT!!!!!! That's me screaming your name is praise and jumping up and down for you over here in Cleveland.  Do you feel the floor shaking?  What a wild ride the launch of P&G's Service Milestones for their 20,000+ European employees in 66 countries was! I remember our early conversations about 'This will be a nice, easier launch than OhioHealth'.  We were off to a great start with Ania. She peppered you daily with emails about tactical things and your responsiveness, attention to detail and examples were stellar! She often praised you for your quick, clear, concise, detailed and well thought out responses. Then a month before the first Service Milestone award is about to go out, you get an email from Ania's boss - Tanya Silina who informs you Ania is out unexpectedly on medical leave.  Tanya's going to jump in and continue on the project.  What!!! You quickly educated Tanya on the ins and outs of the project plan, open items, decisions outstanding - fielding on average 5-7 emails a day, coming at you day and night to keep the launch on schedule.  All the while having new programs added to the Power of You platform like Retirement Awards, Leave of Absence Catch-up Service Milestone Awards and process for ExPats.  You fielded the questions, took the ad hoc calls and built tremendous trust with Tanya. So impressive!!! What you accomplished in the short timeframe in order to deliver their Service Milestone program on time was superb!  P&G's mission statement says .. at P&G, we are committed to delivering products and services that make everyday LIFE better for people around the world!  I'm here to say Rich, you are committed to making people's work lives better everyday around the world!!  You truly enable and inspire positive impact!  Now if only I can get that lovely P&G lady on this image to come do your laundry with the finest P&G products ... you could relax and soak in this moment!!  Thank you, thank you for the Power of YOU!!!!\n\n382#My new desk buddy|Rich -  I was a little hesitant moving desks, but it's been a great experience getting to sit next to you.  You are so patient with all my \"quick\" questions it has been a pleasure being able to listen to you on your launch calls (even if it means we are both here every morning at 8am).   I am very impressed by your knowledge of the system and the way you explain things to clients.  You also do a nice job making them feel comfortable with hard topics and you've clearly established a pleasant, friendly partnership. Great work, my friend!\n\n383#Impressive Effort|Rich; I'm continually impressed by your dedication to deliver the highest quality customer experience, no matter the circumstance. Specifically for your two UAT interactions I had the opportunity to listen to on Monday - you were professional, polished, and thorough, and highly adaptive to a difficult technical challenge that arose from pre-call prep. You're a great teacher and launch teammate, and I appreciate your sharing your experiences with me as I grow in the LSM role.\n\n384#Well done from Lonza!|We have just came off a call with Lonza this afternoon, I want to congratulate you all on the feedback we got from the team. They called out the fantastic work you have done and the great collaboration to get to where we are in the project, and specifically calling out the branding, how we listened and took their direction. We all know it's taken a while to get this one to the final stages but to hear all the positive and appreciative feedback from the client makes it so worthwhile! well done all!\n\n385#Keeping it Human|Rich, I just wanted to thank you for our quick chat in the café this morning. Although it was just a minute or two, you took the chance to ask what I was working on and offer some really valuable words of encouragement and support. As many of us can relate, being assigned your first customer can be somewhat scary, but remembering to be yourself and genuine are truly the keys to success! Thank you for this simple, yet truly valuable reminder that will continue to resonate as I move along in my GloboJourney!\n\n386#EXCEL-lent teammates|Thank you so much for your Excel help over the last couple of weeks! I have had several advanced requests from Dell that require some urgency and you both have been available at the drop of a hat to help me figure it all out. Not only do you do this with a smile, you take the extra time to explain the detail of what you are recommending so I can do this on my own in the future. You are both so talented and helpful and I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to jump in!\n\n387#LinkedIn Rockstars!|Thank you to everyone in Customer Success who paid us a visit during our “LinkedIn Office Hours”.  We so appreciate you updating your profiles and listening to some of our new LinkedIn posting strategies!  LinkedIn has changed so much, and a strong presence from our people will help get our name and culture out there even more!  We are doing big things (and we are FUN), and people should know this.  We are hoping to hear from your future referrals very soon!  - Recruiting\n\n388#Success on a PVH Launch|Way to go team getting PVH to launch today!  It has been a very long journey that began three years ago with an educational meeting for the entire PVH HR team!  Through many challenges and hurdles over the years you brought us to a successful launch of their Global YOS program - and we will follow very closely with the Phase 1 R&R program!  You were able to answer all the questions, deal with all the \"urgency\" and make sure all of the customer representatives were addressed quickly and thoroughly!  Well done - and just keep swimming!\n\n389#inspiring OhioHealth's Peer to Peer Success!|Rich, or should I say, Recognition Rich!!!  \"The Man\" who inspires cultures of recognition and appreciation that are inclusive, inspiring and lead to real tangible, workplace results!  OMG, wish you could have joined us today at OhioHealth to hear first-hand from the OhioHealth program team the huge impact you had on one of the biggest program metrics WINS, peer-to-peer!  You were carrying the discussion on award levels, eligibility and approvals.  You built a compelling argument for why peer-to-peer.  You were faced with a resistant audience of 20+.  They kept playing back \"our associates aren't ready for peer to peer with monetary levels.\"  You strategically and brilliantly kept pushing and in the end they agree, a bit reluctantly.  Today, during our 1-year Account Review, Alice Carol was looking at Inspire's 1-year program inforgraphic and said \"I remember at the Design Lab we didn't think our associates were ready for peer-to-peer.  Look at what this infographic is telling us.  60% of all recognition is between peers.  Our associates are telling is they are ready to recognize each other.\"  I played that Design Lab segment back in my head and was smiling ear to ear, thinking about how you inspired them back on July 11, 2017 and how PROUD the OhioHealth program team is about this metric.  This is all YOU, Mr Rich Recognition.  Delivering best practice, strategy and packaging it all up to inspire a new culture at OhioHealth that's inclusive!!!   In your role, you launch and then do that ... \"love'em and leave'em\" thing but the way you set customers up for success continues AND OhioHealth LOVES the way you helped them design the right program structure for long-term growth and sustainability!  You Rock!!!\n\n390#Patience for PwC|I can't thank you enough for all your help with PwC over the last 6 weeks. You jumped in without hesitation to this massive undertaking of managing data file updates, configuring eligibility, and answering countless random questions...not mention leading their entire UAT. It may have been chaotic at points (or let's be honest...the entire time!) but as usual our amazing team made it happen. And today, 50,000 employees at PwC have the opportunity to recognize each other through this program. (By the way, you better be adding that number to your client list!) Rich - you are just an incredible team player, friend, and colleague and I am so thankful to have the opportunity to work with you on this project! Thank you so much for everything and congratulations to you on this launch.\n\n391#Happy Helpers!|Becky, Tracey & Rich! A big thank you to all of you for your help with the Customer Success offsite (onsite). Becky, from the moment we started planning, you always offered to help in any way you could. The night before, you came to help us set the room up, make it perfect and even write the message on the wall! You are the best! Tracey, you saw me running around and came over and asked to help. Going through the MANY, MANY boxes of charity event donations would not have gone as quickly and smoothly without your help! Thanks for taking time out of your day to help out! Rich, the morning of, you came in early to get some work done. Little did you know I was going to seek you out to see if you could help with carrying some stuff up from the cars, setting up the food tables and offering to help in any way we needed! Thank you for taking the time you set aside to get some work done to help us out! You 3 ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n392#Thinking, always thinking....|Rich, it was great to chat with you today about your ideas for addressing the topic of eThanks with customers during launch.  That's how we get better, when everyone feels empowered and engaged enough to dream up something new and improved.  Thanks for thinking outside the box, for putting some structure around the idea and for having the courage to step up and present it to leadership.  Well done Rich.  A shining example for others.\n\n393#Dynamic Duo|Joyce & Rich - thank you both for including me in yesterday's design lab with Citizen's! Knowing that this was a unique situation of having the client on site, and that there were many people in the room, I really appreciate the opportunity to have this as my first look into how a design lab is managed.  There were many moving parts throughout the day, but you both remained agile and flexible adjusting your flow to meet the needs of the client. You did so in a way that also ensured key topics like communications, branding, data and design were covered in order to reach decisions. You allowed the Citizens team to talk through their concerns, and let them work through some topics that they recognize will be significant change impacts to their current program.  Thank you again for this opportunity; I'm truly excited to shadow both of you during the Citizens launch!!\n\n394#A series of small things...|Trying to be funny, I was searching for a cheesy teamwork poster to include on this award. I ended up coming across this one with the following quote: \"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" If this is not applicable to our team right now, I don't know what is! You have each jumped in without a single hesitation to help with Dell, Edwards, and PwC over the past couple of weeks - config changes, data file loads, slides, Jira tickets, and more. All of the things that might seem like just one little task or project all add up and are having a big impact to these clients. And for me personally, it just reminds me (literally daily) how lucky I am to work with such an amazing, caring group of people. Thank you so much for being amazing teammates and helping me get through.\n\n395#Clutch Configuration Skills|Rich, you were a lifesaver when I was bumping up on a big deadline with Lockheed Martin, helping me navigate their complex program configuration requests for their upcoming international program launch. I can't thank you enough for the guidance and hard work you provided.\n\n396#It's a start!|Congratulations to you all for your joint effort in obtaining PVH’s CEO’s approval for a recognition pilot for 2019. It has been a marathon of phone calls, supporting decks and demos over the last 5 months, but your endurance has brought us to this accomplishment and over the starting line for recognition...and all in parallel to their Years of Service launch phase. Great job to you all!\n\n397#Project Plan Pro|Thank you so much for your help with optimizing my project plan for the Anniversary Timelines Experience! Having your keen eye and knowledge was so helpful is making this project plan the best it can be. I appreciate you taking the time to work with me and teach me something new!\n\n398#Hey Rich, can I ask you a question?|Rich, thank you SO much for all of the support and guidance you have provided these last few months. Launch can be a complicated world, yet you are the \"go-to\" expert. You are incredibly patient, understanding and knowledgeable.You are such an amazing \"desk neighbor\" (the feeling may not be mutual, lol). You are truly an invaluable member of this team and so appreciated.\n\n399#So I have a question...|Christine & Rich, I just wanted to thank you for making time for me this week when a few different unusual situations came up. Christine, not only did you help with a couple config related questions that I needed ASAP, you also had a doc saved from the Skyworks launch that saved the day on some tough gross up related items that answered all of the 13 questions they had! Rich, you walked me through a few different set up/email distro/newsfeed questions and more importantly their downstream effects, so I could consider not just the request but the best decision for the program. I appreciate your time, knowledge and always being yeam players...even at a moments notice!\n\n400#V-3 Launch Expert|Rich! This award is long overdue. It's hard to believe we began this journey of moving AbbVie from multiple data files over to one a year ago. Since the day we started, you led this launch like a true expert! You did such a phenomenal job  managing the client's expectations throughout this entire process. Not to mention, managing their last minute change requests a few days prior to launch! Regardless of what was thrown your way, you always had a smile on and got it done. I am so thankful for all of your support on this project...I really could not have done it without  you! Thank you for being such an awesome teammate. I hope to get to work with you on future projects!\n\n401#Catch-All Conundrum, Solved|Thanks for being my sounding board over the past few weeks regarding all questions Gartner. Since I inherited them I did not know why configurations were the way they were, and most recently trying to pass a data file in Sandbox proved harder than it should've been. Just wanted to let you know I appreciate the laughs we were able to have while we navigated this tiny bump in the road I was having. Thanks for being a great teammate!\n\n402#What a team player looks like|Rich, I have to thank you for all your help with a particular data request this week.  We were having a casual conversation which turned in to you doing what you always do, helping a colleague out without batting an eye.  I have seen so many examples of how great a team player you are in the years we've worked together, but this week was just another example.  Not only did you help me talk through the request, but helped in setting up some formulas that were helpful with other requests as well.  I always appreciate the impact you have across our team and clients.  Thank you Rich for being such a truly great teammate.  You are a consistent Globostar!\n\n403#An eye on efficiency|As you were working on the basesite email and persona projects, you recognized that some of common capability rule functionality the team launches is not part of the basesite setting. Great job identifying these, getting them added to basesite and eliminating a step for the team for efficiency!\n\n404##YouArePVH|The rapidness by which PVH is looking to expand as a client from starting with YOS to making the business case for R&R, and seeking your advice and counsel every step of the way is a testament to how you are delighting this customer. Kathy readily agreed to meet with me and Tom V, and we barely shook hands when she said \"Rich is great - so great. He gives us such great advice, has provided so much information for us, we just love him.\" Kathy especially appreciates that you share other client examples, share best practice advice and then give your personal opinion. She said to let you know on behalf of her and her team how much she appreciates all the work you are doing with her and them. Thanks for providing some extra TLC and being PVH's MVP during YOS and R&R!\n\n405#I hope Rich is joining this call!|Hi Rich, there's not many client calls that I go on in my Globolife, but I've been on a lot more recently, with some of your clients that are launching with Workday. Always impressed by how you handle all questions and queries from the client in a clear and professional manner. I think I learn something new even from your replies in every call. It's always good for me when I join a call knowing that you will be on it too. :)\n\n406#Team PwC|Thanks Rich for taking time on you Friday night to help us prep for the PwC meeting. I have said it before and I will say it a hundred times over, we can always count on you to step up and help with what ever is needed to support our clients and your team. We are very lucky to have you :)\n\n407#Launching success|This past week, each and every one of you has done something amazing to support my clients. Configuration work, managing SOLI tables, following up to make sure branding and SSO were moving forward, answering client questions, taking unexpected meetings...those are just some of the examples of things that you did. What makes these contributions particularly special is that none of you even paused or hesitated to jump in. It means so much to me. It is a truly special thing to work with people who you know will be there for you, and I hope you know that I would do the same for each of you in a heartbeat. I love working with you guys and I cannot tell you how incredibly lucky I feel to be part of this amazing team. Thank you so much for being the best teammates I could ever ask for.\n\n408#Is Patience Your Middle Name?|Rich, I wanted to call out the amazing work you have been doing with your clients. Between Lonza's last minute site changes, PVH's incessant demo requests, and Momentive's recent expedited launch, I don't think I have seen you WITHOUT a smile on your face. Having been on most of these calls and seen the interactions firsthand, I'm impressed by how you juggle it all and how patient you have been with each customer. Keep it up!\n\n409#How Do You Spell Incredible? 'R - I - C - H'|Rich; I've genuinely appreciated the support you've provided over the past few weeks. I've relied on your expertise practically every day as a new member of the team. On my own behalf (as well as Charlene's) - thank you for your willingness to answer every question we've encountered - as well as your guidance and tremendous recognition-experience wisdom. It's been incredibly valuable observing your work with complex and challenging customers. Thank you for your leadership and for continually providing new learning opportunities. I'm grateful for your friendship.\n\n410#Demos for Days|I was so impressed with your demo to PVH's CHRO this morning. It seems as though we have done as many demos as brands they have, and again, you lead with confidence, respect, patience and humor. Dave is going to be a champion and ambassador for their global roll out and its thanks to your ability to build relationships across the organization.  Kathy was also singing your praises on our prep on what an exceptional demo you give and that she was confident in your leadership on the call with her CHRO to deliver the benefits and best practices to him. That is a huge testament to the respect you have earned as a valued partner.  Amazing work Rich, PVH is sure to be a large retail reference for Globofoce going forward. Thank you!\n\n411#Mr. Reliable!|Rich, I wanted to thank you for being so very helpful any time I needed it during WorkHuman. I know that when I reached out to you on shark tank, I could count on you beyond what was asked. You monitored those doors and customers until the session was over! I saw you from across the room and was thinking, thank you Rich!!! We couldn't have guessed that customers would still be floating in after a full hour but you were there at your post to be sure it all went as planned. Thanks for carrying boxes, checking in and just being an amazing teammate!!!\n\n412#Launching into 2018|What a great day we had at our offsite and that is thanks to each one of you! We had fresh ideas and revised approaches to tackling some of our biggest challenges during launch. I appreciate everyone’s unique perspective and when you put them altogether, we strengthen our processes to provide our customers with the best program, launch experience and partnership. I look forward to a successful year ahead of us with this amazing team!\n\n413#Sometimes it takes an Army|Team - let me start by saying you're all unbelievable teammates and your willingness to jump in and lend an assist is a testament to that!  REHAU was rapidly heading toward an easy, seamless launch, but as is usually the case, the client had last minute changes and requests that made things complicated. Each of you jumped in and helped me make sure that the client still had a GREAT launch when they asked us to go above and beyond to get their changes implemented and tested as quickly as possible.   Stephen and Ronan, you jumped in to help get the items addressed quickly even at just about the end of the day on a Wednesday afternoon. You were able to come up with a solution, implement it, test it with me, and then re-route when that plan didn't work exactly as expected. And Ronan - not only did you make it happen, but you checked in with me well after work hours and then again first thing in the morning to make even more adjustments for the client. Laura, our PM at REHAU, asked me to personally thank you both for \"making it happen.\" And it is a sentiment I definitely echo :) Luke, when I needed a new image / image re-sizing, you jumped on it in a matter of seconds without even thinking twice (and I know you had plenty else to do!). Rich/Shawn/Erin - when I was having trouble connecting while offsite with the client and discerning exactly what I was looking at at certain points, you three came together and gave me all the information I needed (AND dropped some files for me!).   As the project manager on this account, it's easy for the client to thank me - but it would be a lie to say I did it on my own! So thank you all for being the army behind me helping make it happen!!\n\n414#Rich with the assist!|Rich, thank you so much for continuing to support Continental beyond the normal duties for the Launch Success manager to assist me as a new CSM. You have made yourself available for all my questions and even continue to jump on calls with the client to ensure the start of their program goes smoothly. I really appreciate all your help and your awesome attitude! Thank you!!\n\n415#Kicking off Momentum at Momentive!|Team,  What a great day we had last Friday at Momentive Performance.  I thought the design Kick-off lab was a great success.  Thank you for putting together a well executed plan.  Joyce, you led the charge and did a great presentation during the day.  Your questions, responses and even keeping me on time during the demo was spot on!  Rich, awesome job on all the launch logistics!  You answered all their questions and ran that part of the day flawlessly.  Sierra great job on connecting with Stephanie from Momentive.  She told me that she is looking forward to working with you once the program launches.  Erik and Shawn, your participation was very helpful, asking thoughtful questions, sharing relevant stories and giving great answers during the day. Overall, I am thrilled with how this day went.  From their Executive sponsor's heartfelt introduction to the always exciting data file conversations, this was a great day.  Awesome colleagues!  The Inspire program at Momentive is going to be a success! Cheers!\n\n416#KT, Conti and OMERs launches in 2 weeks|It’s been a busy two weeks as you launched 3 customers: KLA Tencor, Continental Automotive and OMERs. Maintaining three project plans that are simultaneously in the same phase, keeping it all straight day by day, workstream by workstream and throw in an anniversary horse, takes some serious organizational skills to accomplish. It was a tall order and you were the perfect match for this perfect storm. Hats off to your tremendous work put forth as you enrich the lives of another 28,000 employees across the three customers!\n\n417#Rich Wizardtino|Thanks for sharing one of your magical spreadsheets and giving me back 2 hours in my day. Your excel wizardry always makes my life and the lives of our clients a little bit easier.\n\n418#Guiding Spend Guidance|Rich, great work on setting up KT to launch with Spend Guidance!  While this feature is not yet GA and needs technical and strategic savvy to get the customer and config to the right places, you had a great command of the situation on today's call.  We are lucky to have you on this launch!\n\n419#Dream Team|The branding team would like to thank you all for the great work over the past 12 months. We admire your ability to keep everything moving on different projects and keeping us in the loop and up to date. Have a lovely Christmas and we look forward to working with you in 2018!\n\n420#Moving UHG Timelines Forward...|Rich, I cannot thank you enough for your expertise, guidance and support in moving the UHG Timeliness implementation forward.  You are always well prepared for our discussions and more importantly thinking out side the box when it comes to the endless requests to customize just about everything for UHG.  As they say, where there is a will there is a way and you have flawlessly accepted the challenge to never say no to the UHG Team.  Great job keeping all of us on track and making this launch a success.  Thank you again for all the help in a very tight window.\n\n421#Last minute request!|Rich, great job in getting the client to fill out the questionnaire in a short time before our kick off call. I really appreciated you pushing this one and thanks so much for recognising how vital that information is to us to ensure a successful first round design.\n\n422#Looking for an \"Interface technical lead\"|Rich, thanks so much for your technical expertise and guidance on a data file call with Harman.  You were so critical in joining the conversation to speak to the various technical elements around their employee data file.  It was clear right from the start that you gained the client's trust in how confident you were in talking through potential options to solve the problem.  You clearly and succinctly spoke through how to solve their specific challenges and set the client up for success in how to develop the necessary outcomes on their side.  The Program Manager challenged us with a very detailed, thorough discussion but you were up to the challenge and moved the client forward on a path to resolution.  The client expressed their appreciation for having such a helpful contact join the call.  Thanks for all your help and support.\n\n423#Phenomenal Praise!|Rich I would like to say a huge congratulations to you!  I have had several of your internal colleagues from both sales and SCD's proactively reach out to share their positive feedback regarding how well you are handing your launches with them!  I love to hear such great feedback! They shared that you were calm, confidant, positive and professional during the customer sessions!  This great approach puts our customers at ease and helps make sure that they feel comfortable that we can handle their launch well!  Well done and keep up the great work!\n\n424#Living the Values|Rich and Sophia - All I can say is WOW! To start, this is the first post-launch project call I've attended, and the approach is perfect. OhioHealth is already using many of our features, and seem very pleased with them. The presentation has a great flow and the OhioHealth participants were more and more engaged throughout the call.  Next, Rich, OhioHealth's executive sponsor, Alice, relayed that she has been involved in many implementations over the years and she was so impressed with your project management skills and how you guided them throughout the launch process, even with their aggressive timeline.  As if that's not enough to award you each for, after the feature review and Alice's comments, Sophia went into reviewing the one-page strategy from their Design Lab. I think everyone on the phone said WOW when you pointed out their their reach goal was 60% and they are already at 59%!  It is so clear that you both worked so hard on this project and will take great care of them moving forward. Great job to you both!\n\n425#Outstanding preparation and teamwork today!|Traci, Eileen, Rich, Chris and Krishna-  Wow, outstanding preparation and teamwork today at the Design Lab for UHG Service Timelines.  The energy and flow of the meeting could not have gone any better.  Each of you played a critical role in ensuring confidence in our process and plan to keep them on schedule for launch. Traci, you were over the top with having most of the communication pieces done for them prior to the meeting today.  Rich you were new to UHG and yet you quickly earned their respect and partnership.  I feel very fortunate to work with such an outstanding group of professionals.  I promise we will try a new restaurant on your next trip to Minneapolis. Thank you, Merrie\n\n426#Bravo! Service Celebrations is Happening!!!|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Teamwork!  In channeling my inner Eileen, it's happening!!!!!! Let's raise the roof and cheer - UnitedHealth Group's Bravo! service celebrations is here!  That's right 219,000+ are in for a much, much, much more meaningful and memorable service anniversary experience and celebration thanks to this team!  Merrie, you lead the way with securing this new business ($5M+) with your persistence and never-ending relationship building at UHG.  You have so many fans there.  Eileen, your continued strategic positioning and direction has been critical throughout, not to mention the amazing leadership your internal Bravo! team receives from you making us a well-oiled, always on point, effective and efficient team that delivers (with a smile, of course).  Chris and Krishna you have been leading numerous conversations about the Bravo! service anniversary program configuration and decisions for the last months with the key stakeholders and their readiness was evident today by the number of decisions they had already made which puts them in position to launch in 6 weeks. And Rich, your rock solid project plan, walk through of all aspects of the program, clarity points and confidence this launch WILL happen in 6 weeks was extraordinary today!  I'd believe you if said the Cleveland Browns are going to be in the Super Bowl within the next 2 years! Hahaha.  Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! to you team!  Not only will you be receiving this recognition but Amazon.com will soon be sending you the \"Mouse in a Box\" prank gift thanks to our friend Merrie who turned us on to this fabulous gift!  So if the mouse doesn't make you jump ... Jump up and scream Bravo!!!! instead!!!!!\n\n427#Road Warrior to the Max|Rich, I had to wrestle Lauren for the honor of bestowing this award so this recognition really comes from the two of us.  You had a bit of \"mad\" dash last week, starting with a flight to Michigan and a Design Lab with Continental. You survived my driving in Detroit traffic, downpours from Hurricane Nate, and a very delayed lunch. You were able to thoughtfully take Continental through their program design, acknowledging some of their more unique \"asks\" while trying to steer them to the decisions that will help their program flourish.  Then you had to deal with endless traffic, making it to Detroit just in time to catch the first in two flights to get you out to California late at night to face a second Design Lab.  In California, you were instrumental at the KLA-Tencor Design Lab; encouraging them to think more openly with their approach to peer to peer recognition. You framed the conversations to support their ideas and how they could evolve them into something more strategic. You ended the week red-eye flight home and hosted an early AM introductory call with Lonza before getting some rest. Great job!   Thank you for being so flexible with your schedule and for your commitment to quality in all areas of your work, all in the name of our customers.   Joyce & Lauren\n\n428#Superheroes in Disguise|Erin and Rich - I don't know if you noticed, but you guys have had a LOT going on lately! Clients launching, new clients coming on, shadowing, teaching, you make it all look easy! You're both absolutely dedicated to delivering to our clients, and it shows. Not only in your work, but also in your dedication to helping everyone else get things done as well. You've both been a tremendous support to me, not only in the clients we are working on together, but in the ones I'm working on solo. Questions on a slide deck? You were both happy to not only sit and review the timelines deck I put together, but also to contribute thoughtful critique, recommendations, and Rich - you even sent me some of what you'd use in the past for your clients! Thank you BOTH for being such tremendous assets to the team and to our customers!\n\n429#VLOOKUP Hero!|Rich - Thank you so much for helping me twice in the past week to figure out some Excel craziness through VLOOKUP. Twice I was under pressure to get something updated for Merck and twice you dropped everything you were doing to help me! This may be a little thing, but some days the little things make a big difference. Thank you for being so understanding and helpful!\n\n430#OhioHealth Exec Sponsor Appreciation|In speaking with Alice Carroll, OhioHealth's Executive Sponsor on the success of their launch day, she couldn't be more excited about how engaged and positive their employees are with the program. She quickly turned her appreciate to you and said \"I appreciated the PM support throughout the project from Rich. I’ve never seen a better managed product launch. Despite all odds and some personalities, Rich kept us moving forward to meet our desired and aggressive timeline.\" Congrats on the wonderful client sentiments and thank you again for your dedication to this launch and leading the way to change their culture!\n\n431#Feature Debt Relief|Rich, congratulations in leading the way amongst launch success managers in ensuring that all features are turned on as new clients are launched and we are not accumulating more feature debt. Excellent work thus far and keep it up!\n\n432#Inspire Me, Inspire We, Inspire ALL!!!!|Give me an O ..H...I...O ... what does it spell - OHIO!  And in this case OhioHealth!  It's Ohio's Inspire champion of them all, Rich Sorrentino! The man who lives this motto - Inspire Me, Inspire We and Inspire ALL!  And you have been doing it all for the last 12 weeks and tomorrow, Sept 27th is launch day!!!!  If I think about how success isn't just about what you've accomplished (no small feat) but about what you have INSPIRED others to do - it's remarkable!!!  You inspired a project team of 20+ people to reimage social recognition inclusive of associate to associate recognition for 25,000+ at all award levels, for the first time ever in OhioHealth history.  You masterfully worked through all of the program configuration details to help them arrive at the right decisions based on their program goals and ambitions.  You took the twists and turns of changes and personalities like a Twister champion knowing which hand or foot to place where for ultimate success.   At OhioHealth, they say, the work associates do every day helps improves the health of those they serve.  I say, with Rich, the work he does every day helps improves the LIVES of the workforce at OhioHealth and inspires them to improve others lives by being recognized and feeling valued.  You are a true inspiration to us all.  You represent OhioHealth's values with your dedication to Excellence, display of Stewardship to us all, your Compassion to others demonstrated during the up's and down's and your Integrity of always doing the right thing in a reliable way.  Here's to you - thank you for INSPIRING us all.  You Rock!\n\n433#Thank-YOU! :)|Thanks for your help throughout my onboarding process. Such a wonderful  demonstration of Globoforce's culture. You rock!  Krishna\n\n434#Now Pitching for INSPIRE ... Rich Sorrentino|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Urgency!!!  A million thank you's and cheering that won't stop ... you truly took my urgent request and agreed to sub in and lead one of OhioHealth's manager training sessions with less than 16 hour notice.  That's a big \"ask.\"  This is a very picky client!  Ands without hesitation  you said YES before I had a chance to get all the begging out of my mouth.  I unexpectedly, but delightfully, needed to be at a customer awards ceremony today and you graciously subbed in.  Tracey Clayton was raving about your performance and said directly, \"Rich did a great job today on the training.  For someone who hasn't seen the last 4, he was spot on.\"  I was waiting for the other shoe to drop and her say ... and I'd like him to close out the last 3 sessions, too. Hahaha.  Thanks for pitching in at a moments notice!  You are an amazing partner!!!\n\n435#Calm, cool, and collected!|I've been in a bunch of meetings with you lately and I'm always comforted to know you're a part of the meeting. You bring a sense of calmness, knowledge, expertise, and willingness - not to mention a voice of reason when the going gets tough.   Thanks for all you do to not only reassure our customers, but also to guide our Globoforce team throughout the launch process.\n\n436#Launch Team Experts!|Thank you so much for all your assistance lately!! While relaunching Shire, I've had so many random launch questions that I haven't experienced before and I can always count on you for great guidance. I truly appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge and give advice.  Thank you for being great teammates!\n\n437#Excel masters!|Thank you thank you thank you for helping me with the Aryzta retroactive YOS template. You are both excel masters that I am learning so much from. Rich, the tool you created for determining who receives a YOS award is so helpful and Liz, when the client had questions about some of the data you jumped right in to help me clarify the file. Many thanks to you both!\n\n438#Unwavering Patience|Rich, thank you so much for your unwavering patience this week. You have sat down with me on several occasions to walk me through certain scenarios. Specifically, today we discussed a few testing scenarios as well as a plan if the system did not test as expected. When the testing when slightly awry, I decided to troubleshoot and go ahead with the plan we discussed. However, the plan we had discussed was not the solution to the issue with testing! I appreciate your patient explanation as to what the error I encountered was, the solution to the error, and in what cases we would use the resolution I tried.\n\n439#Successful Kick Off Call with AbbVie!|Rich- I wanted to recognize you for the fantastic job you did on the kick off call to move AbbVie over to V3/1 data file! I am so impressed with the way you structured the conversation and communicated each step of the process to the AbbVie Team. Moving a client over to one data file (especially a client like AbbVie with complex business rules) is new to me, so having your support is greatly appreciated! It has been quite awhile since we last worked together, so I am so excited to have the opportunity to partner with you again. Thank you again, and I look forward to working with you on this project over the next few months!\n\n440#Time to Celebrate|A HUGE thanks to everyone involved in the Aryzta launch. With each new client comes new challenges and we demonstrate time and time again that as a team we can meet these challenges head on and come out on top. I appreciate all the hard work each of you put into this project to make it a success. It’s time to celebrate. Take a deep breath and enjoy. Great job everyone!!\n\n441#UI Team Visit|Guys, on behalf of the UI team- I just want to thank you all so much for taking the time last week to meet us and introduce yourselves to Kevin. It was really great to get an overview on what challenges both teams face and how we can try work the solutions into our new and improved processes. We all really enjoyed spending time sitting with you all, you made us feel very welcome! We hope we can afford you the same hospitality when you guys are over this side of the pond!\n\n442#Trust him, he is a limo driver...|Rich, I wanted to say thank you and recognize you for all of the help you have given me recently to get up to speed on my new customers Aryzta and Ohio Health and any other question that comes to mind. You jumped into the Aryzta launch the week of their go live and it has been a great learning experience for me to learn from you about Timelines settings, translations and all of the fun things they asked about in their last week before go live. You are a wealth of knowledge and I sincerely appreciate being able to ask you any and all questions. Thanks again!\n\n443#Launch Calendar Efficiency|Thank you for taking the initiative of finding a way to make the Launch Calendar be more accurate and more efficient for the team. As a result, our team had a reduction in duplicate entries and other departments have a clearer forecast for resource planning. Awesome job!\n\n444#Setting OhioHealth Up for Success - Design This!|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Teamwork!  A huge Thank You team for making the journey to the \"Heart of it All\" - OHIO!  Matt, you started this partnership with your superb sales skills and relationship building.  It was evident today that Tracey, Alice and the OhioHealth team hold you in high regard as a trusted partner.  You've positioned how social recognition can help them achieve their goals and they are ALL IN for positive change and results asap.  September launch is on their minds.  Liz, you did a great job kicking us off today, managing expectations, the agenda and laying the foundation for how the Globoforce team now and on-going will support OhioHealth in their quest to build a culture of everyday recognition and appreciation.  Thank you for indulging me with the Fun Facts during intros.  Rich, you nailed the program structure bits not backing down from best practice in a nice, pleasant way with a tone of \"We want OhioHealth to be successful, achieve your desired ambitions and goals, and eThanks won't get you there in the long run\".  Tough conversations, great delivery.  Amy, awesome to re-team with you again in a Design Lab session.  Your presence, leadership, launch expertise and key nuggets during branding and program structure instilled lots of confidence with OhioHealth they were in good hands with Globoforce.  Liz, it was great to have you shadow on the day.  I saw you taking copious notes, thank you!  And if it wasn't for you and your Spanish, none of us would have had the right dinner last night at the Mexican restaurant.  It's been a sincere pleasure working with you all on this new account.  OhioHealth's initial program brand names should be our GF-OhioHealth team name #Power of We, Believe and Inspire!  You rock!!! P.S. sorry about the photo.  The photo taker somehow got a reflection from the screen.  It looks like we are all tattooed in the front .. next time, matching Recognition Rocks tattoos for ALL!\n\n445#Phew!!|I bet you are saying to yourself \"Phew\" I am glad Christine is back in the office!! Thank you very much for covering Aryzta while I was away. Having you at the helm during this critical time in the implementation was very important. It is not easy stepping in in the middle of an implementation, especially with such a demanding client, so kudos to you for a job well done!!\n\n446#Best Team Ever!|Launch Team – All I can say is WOW. I am overwhelmed by your support on the incredibly complex JLL configuration and testing.  When the client couldn’t clearly identify their own eligibility but still wanted to launch in the same time frame and communicated this the day I left for vacation. The launch team jumped into action, helping check, reconfigure, and test all aspects of the JLL program.  I cannot thank the team enough for all the support while I was out. Every one of you is amazing and I couldn’t ask to be a part of a better team.   Thank you!\n\n447#Booz Allen Manager Digest Assistance|A big 'Thank You' to you for your help with the Booz Allen Manager Digest analysis yesterday. I really appreciate your assistance in pulling together the manager data so quickly so that I could return it quickly to the client. I also very much appreciate that you did this voluntarily. I didn't ask....you just saw that I was in need and stepped in to see how you could help.  Thanks for being a great teammate.\n\n448#Abbott is LIVE with Service Timelines!|Rich, so many congrats and undying gratitude for your excellent leadership of the Service Timelines launch at Abbott.  This project, years in the making, was executed FLAWLESSLY!  Your confidence, expertise, organization, and passion for excellence inspired Abbott to not only launch in their largest population but also got them to trust that the timing and opportunity was right to launch social simultaneously.  SOCIAL at Abbott! We all work so hard to lead customers down the right path, and once we get them to the door, we only have one chance to blow that door open.  YOU blew that door wide open for us by bringing your incredible execution of your very detailed, thoughtful plan.  MANY MANY thanks for all of the time, multiple conversations, strategy discussions, and who knows how many crazy requests and repeat requests from our team and the Abbott team.  You are a Master.  SO WELL DONE!!!!\n\n449#WOW|Rich, I wanted to let you know that I was blown away by your performance at the BJC Design Lab. You and I have worked together on four launches now and it has been great to see you fine tune your skills and approach along the way. I've always considered you to be fantastic at speaking about the tactical and technical aspects of the launch but now I think you might be even better at the strategic aspects! You put a lot of thought and preparation into how we should approach some difficult conversations with BJC and when the moment came, it couldn't have gone any better. You did a fantastic job of guiding BJC through the conversation and allowing them to reach the appropriate decision themselves. You balanced your knowledge of our platform and recognition in general with the uniqueness of BJC's business. Whenever BJC had questions about the product, you didn't just explain how things worked but why they work that way. Customer Success is lucky to have you and so are our customers. Looking forward to working with you on this launch!\n\n450#BJC Design Lab Masters!|Lots of preparation, as usual, paid off:  My hats off to the BJC Healthcare pre-launch team for an incredible on-site Design Lab today.  We were concerned about the multiple directions this meeting could have taken us, but everyone's preparation, including who would handle what key points and how to pivot and when, has led us down a path of true success with this new client.  Many obstacles were clarified if not overcome, including our #1 objective: 15 multiple programs down to 1!  Once you get them to the place where they can really drive the recognition experience with great valued awards, this client will be in our top 20, and a huge healthcare reference in the Midwest.  The relative stories we shared were pertinent to their understanding of how we can simplify their disparate complexity, and the trust that was built from how this team brought credibility was truly amazing.  My thanks and I know a lot of work is ahead, but it's work that will yield some great results for not only BJC, but also Globoforce.\n\n451#Launch Wrap Up Call!|Great call!   1 month in and 641 recognition moments on 2000ee that is GREAT!    Was amazing to take part in my 1st launch wrap up and tag team to try to ensure program traction and enabling new functionality such as Mood Tracker, Life Events, Conversations!     Looking forward to many many more calls like this with you both!\n\n452#Making an iMpact at Mallinckrodt|RICH! We haven't worked together in awhile, and I'm so glad I got picked to work with you on Mallinckrodt. This is a terrific customer and program in so many ways, and guiding them to (and sometimes through) good decisions is all down to you. I got to sit back and watch as you masterfully handled difficult conversations, and I relied on your judgment time and again as we created a superb program for our newest star customer. Cognrats on a great launch!\n\n453#Feedback from: VP of Total Rewards|It's always a pleasure to have customers be repeat customers with great experiences at both companies. In this case, the VP of Total Rewards was an employee of Abbott and is now the executive sponsor on the Mallinckrodt iMpact Recognition program and sang your praise on exceeding expectations - “…  Truly the team from Globoforce has been stellar in supporting us and unlike other implementations I’ve seen in my career.  I had previously had good experience with Globoforce at Abbott, but this experience has been way above and beyond!  “ Congrats on the wonderful client feedback!\n\n454#Continued Support|Rich, thank you for your continued support and guidance with Cypress as we transition to post launch. Your willingness to spend extra time answering questions I have, walking me through how to make certain changes and troubleshoot issues is  very appreciated!  Especially because this is my first launched client, I just wanted to say Thank you!!\n\n455#Escape from data purgatory|Rich, thanks for stopping what you were doing as I walked over on a Friday afternoon when we are all trying to wrap up the week to help me with a client test data file that was giving me errors without clear cause. You both explained the likely cause, then showed how to address it. Results readily provided a successful data file, saving untold amount of time trying to figure it out on my own.\n\n456#Abbott project|Rich, I just want to say great job managing the Abbott project. Your ability to keep us moving forward, document decision, and ensure we are all informed on the status of the project is important to the overall success of the project in the long term I feel we are in great hands with you at the helm. Keep up the great work!\n\n457#Embracing Slack|Rich, I wanted to thank you for posting about the Cypress launch in the new #ringthegong channel on Slack. Sometimes adopting new technology can be difficult and I appreciate you leading the way by embracing it and using Slack to share company-wide, exciting news. Thank you for being part of the early adopters innovating how we communicate at Globoforce!\n\n458#Celebrating Cypress!|Congratulations on launching Cypress’ Recognition and Years of Service programs. They had an aggressive launch of 78 days from contract and you successfully lead them to stay focused, meet the deliverables and launch on time. Thank you for your focus and dedication to this launch and adding another 6,000 employees to your list of humans you are impacting!\n\n459#LSC Checklist Live!|Rich, thank you so much for helping to refine the LSC Checklist. Your input on my role and the launch process has been invaluable. You have been an ambassador when I was getting conflicting direction and provided clarity on my role. I really appreciate your leadership and teamwork!\n\n460#I Got the \"A\" Team!|Lynette and Rich, a huge thanks to both of you for your work with Mallinckrodt on their all day design lab. Short notice for an onsite meeting as they were anxious to get going and the day was terrific.    It was great to see two of our very best guide them through the process, provide them with best practices and let them know that we will provide them with the best employee recognition program in the industry.  Your message throughout the day reassured them they had made the right decision to partner with us. I received feedback that we surpassed their expectations and they are even more excited to have the program rolled out to their employees.  This is a big step in now having a marquee client in the STL market as a point of reference to open more doors for us.  Thanks again for all your excellent work!\n\n461#Helping Hand|Rich - Thank you again for your help with getting Varex off the ground last week. I am so appreciative of your willingness to lend a helping hand while I was out of the office and the client ran into a few issues during their launch. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!\n\n462#Hit the Ground Running at 150 MPH Team!|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Teamwork!!!  Ladies and Gentleman, YOU ROCK!!!  WOW, what a group of amazing, overachievers who sprang out of bed and hit the ground running at 150 MPH.  Thank you all for your various contributions at today's Booz Allen Hamilton Design Lab.  Each of you were critical to the progress that was made today.  The foundational pieces are in place - major WINS on Program Structure moving from a cash-based solution to a points-based solution with lower value awards, getting close on final signoff for grossing up, keen interest in a CEO video, the right change management plan and overall, inspiration for the BAH team to Think BIG, Act BIG.  Though the days and weeks ahead will be require the client to quickly come to final decisions for a Mid-May launch,  the foundation that was built today puts them in a much better place than yesterday!  Many thanks for giving it your 150!!!\n\n463#The Waters Program Maestro!|Rich, Over the past 7 months I have been thoroughly impressed how you orchestrated the launch segment of the Waters IMPACT program.  Most of your meetings involved people all around the world at Waters and keeping them on the same page was a challenge and you did it!  Dealing with some delays on their side with their CEO building brand new values that are the foundation of this program, you kept everyone on the level and moving forward.  You are one of the leaders on the launch team.  I can't wait to work with you again on the next prospect that I (our Globoforce team) bring in.  Keep up the great work.  Your strategies definitely need to be celebrated and educated! Cheers!\n\n464#Thanks for helping a rookie!|Mark & Rich,  I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the support on my first launch. Having both of you behind me gave me that extra bit of confidence. Your willingness to answer questions or jump into conversations was instrumental in the success of this launch. Cheers to Lurie and many more. Thanks guys!\n\n465#Launch: Take 2|Rich, I wanted to thank you for all your help with the \"2nd launches\" for both AtlantiCare and Otsuka.  In each of these cases the client launched a portion of their program first, but needed to hold off on launching everything at once.  For AtlantiCare, they are launching their monetary recognition awards program next month and Otsuka just launched their entire Sales program last month.  When we learned there was going to be a phased approach in each of these launches, you proposed that when it came time to carry out their \"phase 2\" that I pull you back into the project and let you run with the necessary configuration and project calls.  This allowed me to continue to focus on the current program that was live and you were able to handle the launch.  This was obviously a huge help to me and certainly saved me some time of having to add two mini launches back on to my plate.  Throughout the entire process, you've been great to work with and always available to help out with a question or client concern.  Thanks so much for your partnership on these two accounts, I really appreciate it!\n\n466#Up, up and away with Waters|Rich, it has been a real treat to walk with you through the Waters implementation journey. You've done an amazing job navigating the complexities of their global challenges and have managed every detour with a sense of calm and cautious optimism. Being onsite for launch today was great, because I got to hear the executive sponsor praise the great job you did!  The highlight, though, was hearing Jamie explain why she was wearing a feather boa! Apparently, one of her naysayer colleagues made a snarky remark at the outset of this process, something to the effect of, \"what are we going to do with these stupid points, buy ourselves a feather boa?\" Today, when Jamie showed up at work, she had a feather boa on her desk as a gift from that former skeptic. That really says it all. Your good work helped turn skeptics into raving recognition fans!!!\n\n467#Thank you!|Thank you for your sense of urgency when working on merchandise and gift card presentations for a new customer.  She has delivered a tough message that they're no longer able to invest so heavily with cash in their anniversary program.  We have helped her with every stage of the messaging and one of the final components was a request for merchandise and gift card examples in all of their countries.  You gathered the information which takes time but reinforces what a great partnership she'll have with Globoforce. Now she can deliver a message that employees will be recognized throughout the year for their hard work and not just for their milestone anniversaries.  I can't wait to see how this program evolves over time and becomes a part of their culture.  Thanks again for your help on this urgent request.\n\n468#New Canadians (customers that is) in good hands!|Rich, this is long overdue but I wanted to take a moment to say thank your for all you did to get Minto and Apotex successfully launched.  Having just returned from the HRPA show and speaking with Dave Bond there, who's been converted into one of our biggest allies and many of the team from Apotex who are so excited to go live with their first group, I wanted you to know how much your efforts are very much appreciated.   I've also appreciated learning from you and how we can help make the launch process run smoothly together, listening to you gather key information up front and asking good questions early on so that there are no surprises and the right expectations are set.  You make it look easy thanks to your deep program knowledge, excellent PM abilities and skillful navigation of the customer on-boarding process.  Thank you!\n\n469#A-Team Style|Rich, I just wanted to say thank you and great job taking the lead on our latest team project! You did a fantastic job of creating the work flow - project management style! - , assigning tasks while still letting us choose the areas we were most comfortable with, keeping us on track during meetings and encouraging us all to contribute/add to the process and conversation. It was a great experience and I really enjoyed the project and getting to work on it with you, Cam and Chris. Thank you!!\n\n470#Coverage King|Rich - Thank you for doing such a wonderful job covering for me while I was out. The way you handled a few last-minute client request really made me feel like I could disconnect and enjoy my vacation. This really made Work Human hit home. You are a great teammate Rich! Thank you again!\n\n471#PSAV & Minto Launches|Thank you Rich for your hard work and dedication delivering success with both PSAV and Minto in Q4!  Rich you manage to develop great relationships with your customers as you lead them through the launch phase which earns you the right to guide them towards best practice programs.  It has been great to work with you directly over the past 6 months or so and witness first-hand how you manage tough questions and situations with great professionalism and calm.  Thank you for demonstrating great Respect for your customers and colleagues alike.  I am confident that Waters, Apotex and BJC are in great hands with you at the helm for their 2017 launches!  I am looking forward to achieving great success together in 2017!  Happy New Year!\n\n472#Last Minute Coverage|Rich, I cannot thank you enough for covering for me yesterday with Minto! Even though we are fully transitioning the account over to me, you stepped right in to help me out when I needed it last minute! You made the client very happy not having to cancel the last meeting of 2016. Thank you for always having my back and for being such a GREAT team player! You are the best!\n\n473#A True Wing Man|Rich, thank you for going to bat for me to allow me to project manage my first client with your guidance and knowledge. You sensed I was chomping at the bit and couldn't wait to begin to contribute as a team member. Your guidance with Element Fleet, and going out of your way to make sure I won't fall flat on my face shows how much you care about this team and our success. You've helped in situations where I wasn't 100% comfortable, and have reinforced my thoughts and actions through your mentoring. You are an invaluable team member, and I hope one day to be someone else's wing man as you have been mine. Thank you for everything.\n\n474#Human File Cabinet|Thank you for providing the resources and documentation I ask for with speed and a smile! You are a wealth of knowledge, and having seen your organization first hand, you are my \"go to guy\" for all documentation launch related. You have helped me with award advisors, updated project plans, configuration questions and so much more. THANK YOU\n\n475#Action Items Done!|In our team meetings, we now have a formal action item log we're keeping, to track what we're doing (and would like to do), ensuring things get done, and keeping the team informed.  Both Rick and Rich recently took on some process improvement actions, updated the log w/o being asked, and shared the results of their efforts with the team for feedback\\acceptance\\ documentation.  This was seamless, and without any nudging or intervention on my part ==> it just happened!  Thank you for embracing this tool, and continuing to propel our high-performing team.\n\n476#MoodTracker Excellence|I just want to acknowledge you for the great job you did with Apotex the other day. From over the cube wall, I happened to catch most of your MoodTracker conversation. I was impressed with how conversational you were when presenting talking points  about how this tool can help clients get real data on employee satisfaction in the  workplace and with the specific recognition program our clients implement.  You  easily and effectively communicated to the client that this is just another way that Globoforce helps our clients launch successful recognition programs.  Great work!\n\n477#Minto Launch SUCCESS!!|Rich, I don't even know where to begin. I am so glad that I got to be a part of this launch with you. You not only gave it your all for the client, but you did the same for me and more. This was my first launch and really had no idea what to expect. You were so patient with me, answering all the questions I had, making me a part of everything from beginning to end, even trusting me to step in for you while you were out. I have gained so much knowledge thanks to you! Thank you so much for everything you did for both me and the client. Thanks to you, I get to take over the account and work with some extremely happy people over at Minto! Thanks for being a great team player and wonderful trainer! I can't wait to work with you on another launch in the future!!!\n\n478#High-performing team|A high-performance team can be defined as a group of people with specific roles and complementary talents and skills, aligned with and committed to a common purpose, who consistently show high levels of collaboration and innovation, that produce superior results.  I had the pleasure of having my first Launch Success Manager team meeting yesterday, focused on refining the Customer Success Coordinator - Launch Success role, as Shawn will be joining us on Monday.    Everyone showed up prepared with their think-ahead ideas, participated, and supported each others ideas (even when there were different ideas), etc. Together, we developed a comprehensive and actionable plan, and are ready for Shawn on Monday.  Thank you!\n\n479#Always there for Help|Rich, I am have been so impressed over the last few months at how much knowledge you have gained from launching our customers. I am so in your debt from the countless times I have leaned on your for guidance and feedback on your experience with client queries.  I love that you have thought things through from a starting point to a finish and making it easy not just for the customer but for your team mates as well! Well done and thanks again!!\n\n480#A long overdue thank you!|Rich, thank you for being a great teammate, you are always willing to give a helping hand!  I was creating a new eligibility for a client and you hopped on the phone last minute when I asked for your advice.  You always go the extra mile, thanks again!\n\n481#Eligibility Educator|Rich, thank you so much for taking the time the other day to urgently review and help me understand some complicated eligibility rules for a client. Even though it was an easy fix, I appreciate you educating me further on the process and in turn helping to quickly appease the client. Thanks again for being such a knowledgeable, helpful team member and for being so quick to assist in a pinch!\n\n482#Success in the North! Apotex & Element|\"Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.\" --Michael Jordan  Thank you to all of you for your help this quarter in helping Canada win a great Championship!     We successfully brought in two new Canadian customers; Apotex & Element Financial, close to 1.5M CAD in bookings and we did so as a team thanks to all your help and dedication!    Neither of these deals were easy!!!  A special mention to Hillary, Nick and Lauren!  You were definitely MVP's on this deal throughout the contract negotiation!   #WETHENORTH\n\n483#Thinking on your feet|Great job this morning on the Waters call, Rich! Just when it seemed like the group was headed back to square one in terms of the program name, you made a clever decision to visually present an idea (using Micralabs) and everybody seemed to rally around it! Your quick thinking and creativity got them \"unstuck\" and potentially shaved weeks off the project. As a result, the call ended on a high note and the Waters team sounded enthusiastic about presenting the idea to their CEO.\n\n484#WESCO, Air Products, BMC, Otsuka & Boart Launches!|Congratulations Rich!  You have been a busy bee!  These great launches have happened over the past few months and you have driven them through exceptionally well, navigating some challenges professionally and bringing these great companies onto the platform.  WESCO launched R&R and physical service award packs to 9,000 employees, Air Products launched R & R and Timelines to their 16,000 employees, BMC launched R & R and Timelines to their 1,300 employees, Otsuka launched R & R and Timelines to 1,8-- employees and Boart finally got off the ground launching R & R and Timelines to their 4,700 employees!  Wow - great job Rich, thank you for successfully launching these great companies and welcoming them to the Globoforce family of customers!\n\n485#Shining Stars R&R Re-Launch|Rich, when AtlantiCare launched back in April with YOS and e-thanks only, you offered to come back in as the Launch Success Manager when they were ready to design and configure their R&R program.  We had our first intro/kickoff call earlier this week to talk about the project and I gave you all of 30 minutes notice to join the meeting.  Not only did you quickly wrap up your lunch, but you also updated a slide deck to use specifically for this call.  Not surprising, the meeting went great and you did an excellent job laying out expectations of what we'll need from AtlantiCare.  Thanks so much for your willingness to take on this additional \"re-launch\" of the Shining Stars program and thanks for joining the call at the last minute.  Looking forward to continue working with you on this.\n\n486#Always helping out...|Thanks Rich for your help with a unique award eligibility request.  You literally dropped what you were doing and helped walk me through a challenging scenario involving a few different countries.  I always appreciate your approach in diagnosing a particular question, with a thoughtful and detailed response.  You are a great teammate and constantly available with any question that comes your way.  Thank you\n\n487#Launch Manager Awesomeness!!|Rich, over the past few weeks of the Minto launch, I have learned so much from you! Your knowledge, your drive to ensure the client succeeds and your patience for me with all of my questions is truly wonderful!! I feel so lucky to be learning this process from you and look forward to being by your side throughout this entire launch! Thank you for everything you have done for me this far. I am (and so is the client) so lucky to have you!\n\n488#Amazing first three weeks!|Great Start!  Launch Team – Thank you SO much for the incredible first three weeks. The way you all have welcomed me to the team has been a wonderful experience. I am extremely happy with my choice to join the Globoforce family and even happier to have landed with such a great group of people.  Christine – Thank you for taking the time to guide me through the everyday life at Globoforce as well as some wildly complex launches. You have made me feel so comfortable and your support and encouragement continues to increase my excitement for this role.  Judith – Thank you for the scheduling, site training, password setup, resource setup, Dublin setup… I could keep going but I think we might run out of space. Thank you for EVERYTHING you’ve done over the past few weeks!  Erin – Thank you for including me in everything from client calls to group lunches.  Additionally, thank you for fielding my endless questions on the various systems. I am continually impressed on how calm, cool and collected you are in everything you do.  Rich – Thank you for all the documentation and data you’ve shared with me. Since we are both “data guys” you know how helpful this is in my on-boarding process. Also, thank you for asking for my thought on things. That small act has made me feel valued right from the start.    Rick – Thank you for the quiet guidance. Anytime I’ve got a question you are always smiling and willing to help.   I really appreciate everything this team has done! I know on-boarding someone new isn’t the easiest thing to accommodate, you have all made it awesome.\n\n489#Launch & Learn Stars|Thank you team for doing an outstanding job both preparing for and delivering the presentation walking the Sales team through the launch process for our first Launch & Learn.  I was so impressed by your passion for this project and dedication to partnering with the Sales team on this exciting project driving towards an effortless customer experience!  I am confident that with your commitment to working together with Sales we will see even greater launch success!  Well done team!\n\n490#Go Team Waters!|What an impressive showing at Waters today, thanks to you! This Design Lab was a true team effort – maybe the most inclusive I’ve been involved in. Every single person played a role and that’s certainly what led to such a successful day with this new customer. Rich – you were so impressive! You’re so knowledgeable about our product and implementation process, and you were prepared, relaxed, customer-focused and funny. What a great partner. You made this easy and I’m grateful for the chance to work alongside you on this. Chris – you established yourself firmly as the long-term go-to by kicking off and wrapping up so professionally and creating some nice rapport with the customer. You did a great job of conveying the level of support they can expect from GF. Surely they feel confident in our partnership with you at the helm. Naomi – While technically there to shadow, you made some key contributions (as is your way) in getting the team prepped. Thank you for managing nearly all of the logistics singlehandedly like the deck edits, endless uploads and downloads and coming up with the M&M intro idea. Cam – I loved how enthusiastic you were! I’m so glad you personally got a lot out of the day. And thank you for sharing your smart observations about millennials and performance management. So on-point. Scott – you provided a seamless bridge between the sales experience and the customer experience. Thank you for your enthusiastic and support-exuding opening remarks, for jumping in during the demo and adding some great perspective throughout the day. It’s obvious how much the customer respects and trusts you. Together we planted seeds today that will grow to become a culture changing movement at Waters! Go Team!   P.S. Hi, my name is Julio. Just call me Chuck.\n\n491#Bravo! for BMC!|Rich, I wanted to take a moment to CONGRATULATE you on the recent launch of BMC Bravo!  Oh, what it took to get this one off the ground.....it's a 2-phased launch with 1,000 people in the first phase, but they were represented by 20  people on each weekly call, 2 program owners, 2 substitutes and 1 project manager. And Globoforce?  WE HAD YOU!  You took it in stride, cut out the politics, helped them focus and knocked it out of the park.  Great work.\n\n492#Avanade Problem Solver|Rich - Thanks for helping Cam and I to troubleshoot the error we were getting for Avanade. You just overheard us talking and jumped in with multiple ideas as to what could be causing the error...and one of them turned out to be right! Not only did this save me from opening up a bug for the issue, it helped the Strategy team to continue moving on some time sensitive items due to the client this week. Thanks again!\n\n493#Timelines help!|Your response to my Timelines question blew me away. Talk about going above and beyond! I know you are busy with multiple implementations and leading the SWAT team so I am even more grateful for the thoughtful and detailed help you provided. Explanations, screen shots and offering to join a call- THANK YOU!!\n\n494#User Interview|Rich, many thanks for taking the time to talk to me last week about the Cloning Awards feature I have been working on within the Config App. It has been invaluable to gain some insight into your own processes that you use when setting up new awards and gather your feedback around the project. Thanks again.\n\n495#GloboGuzzler for the win!|Well done on your creative construction and demonstration of the “GloboGuzzler” at the summer outing! Congratulations on winning first prize and enjoy your Globostar!\n\n496#Words of Widsom|Just days before my 1st client on-site meeting, we were in a SWAT team meeting which wrapped up quite early. Instead of taking back that time in your day, you both proceeded to lend me the lessons of your experiences while visiting yours clients so I could make the most of my time with my client. Not only did your words of wisdom help me get prepared, it showed me the kind of people that make up this department. I cannot thank you enough for your support!\n\n497#Outstanding work on the Air Products Launch!|Well I wasn't sure this day would ever arrive, but a big hats off to you for all of the work you put into the Air Products launch.  Pound for pound, this was certainly one of our more challenging (at times) launches.  Throughout all of the ups and downs, you were always providing the guidance and reassurance they needed to get them to this point.  Sometimes implementations can be difficult, especially after a difficult sales cycle but with all of your support we can know focus on delivering a great program which delivers outstanding results to our customer.  Thanks so much for all of the time and effort you put into this one!\n\n498#Great Work on PSAV Program Launch Meeting|Lauren, Rich and Will,  terrific work in our all day meeting with PSAV to get their program started.  Your expertise in answering their questions, providing direction and engaging them was perfect.  It was great to see you all in action and learn from the process what all is involved for launching a global program.  The success of this account will help us with other opportunities in the Chicago market.  Great job and thanks for being great at what you do.  Mark\n\n499#Datafile Configuration Guru|Thank you so much for taking the lead on the datafile configuration for ACI's new HRIS system.

Sending you a HUGE High 5!\n\n500#Recording Expert|Rich thanks for jumping in last minute to teach me how to record a BT Meet call.  You are always ready and willing to help. Thanks again.\n\n501#The Globoarmy Strikes Again (Lilly Launch)|THANK YOU for your help bringing Lilly to a successful launch day. This was truly a company wide effort. Without your support we would not have been able to reach this day. Your contribution helped make this launch a success and it is very much appreciated. Great work team!!!\n\n502#Great Customer Feedback - Atlanticare|Congratulations on this great customer feedback regarding the implementation process!  Great to hear such a glowing review form our clients!  The client shared: \"The implementation process went like clockwork. Rich Sorrentino has been a fabulous partner in this process. This team helped with decisions around the branding and what the site would look like. They provided us with educational materials and made the implementation process as easy as it could have been from our perspective. We appreciated this. “Awesome job!!!  Thank you!\n\n503#Congratulations on AtlantiCare Launch!|Thank you Rich for your great efforts launching AtlantiCare!  4500 employees now have a more positive experience at work, thanks to the R & R and Timelines Shining Star program launch on March 7.  You have done a wonderful job launching this client and it was great to see the positive note they sent out after they received the launch cookies from you :  \" I got a box of wicked good cookies!  And they look great with the logo! After making sure they are fit for consumption (LOL!), I am going to save them for the happy hour celebration we have planned to the team on 3/23! Thanks so much….you all are really good at the recognition thing!\"  Thank you for delivering a successful launch for AtlantiCare!  Great job!\n\n504#Launch project plan professional|Rick, thank you for including me on your program project calls over the past few weeks.  It has been an incredible learning experience hearing all the nuances that come up in the launch cycle.  I'm always impressed with the ease in which you handle all the client's questions with a level headed approach, clearly explaining the simple and complex details.  It's clear you are focused on delivering a flawless launch experience and I've heard firsthand the positive feedback from your contacts.  I also appreciate your level of detail following the call and walking me through your approach with each client.  You've been a great resource.  Thanks again!\n\n505#Many hands make light work|Guys, I just wanted to thank you all on behalf of the branding team for the incredible amount of work you've all been putting in over the past couple of months. It's been a busy time with a lot of new and current clients (DHL, Brother, Lilly, Dunkin, BMS, Avanade, Alere, Atlanticare, Informatica, Air Products, KPMG and possibly more that I have forgotten!) and you've been such great team players. The work we see is only part of what you do but between scheduling calls, consolidating feedback, obtaining various designs assets, setting expectations for our clients, and basically keeping the ball rolling on numerous projects, we want to say THANK YOU!\n\n"
"506#Thanks For Helping|Thank you for stepping in and helping me. I appreciate you taking time out of you busy schedule. You guys are the best!!\n\n507#Living \"Teamwork\"|Thank you both for stepping up and agreeing to help out your colleague in a time of need!  Without question you both stepped up and offered to assist and have agreed to take on a significant amount of extra work to ensure that the customers are serviced to the appropriate level and the launches are delivered successfully.  It is great to see you living Teamwork, Respect for Colleagues and Respect for Customers with a little Respect for Urgency thrown in!  Thank you!\n\n508#Sharing your launch success|Rich, Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to join us on the Sales and Marketing call to talk about the recent launch at Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA.  It helps the team to learn about how a launch goes. Hopefully we will be able to have you on again in near future!\n\n509#Design lab excellence - Otsuka|Rich, great work leading the design lab at Otsuka.  I was impressed with the internal legwork you did before the meeting when this new client threw us a few curveballs.  During Ignite you were able rally the team and strategize on our options.  You then clarified the customer's expectations before we arrived for the design lab.  This ensured that we were on target when we arrived in the room.  What was most impressive was how you steered the conversation on the fly and were able to get the customer to think bigger about recognition and the impact it can have at Otsuka.  You had answers for all of the client's technical questions but even better you shared the rationale and benefits of our approach to recognition.  It was hard to believe that this was your first in person design lab.  Great job!\n\n510#Leading the charge!|Rich, I want to extend my gratitude for your teamwork, brainstorming and ideation while we work through the discovery of \"uncovered treasures\" with Otsuka.  We've received some unique scenarios from them that were not part of the sales process and we have teamed up to go down this path together, bring in the right resources and make sure this experience is a good one for Otsuka.  Keep up the great work.  I'm right here with you, bud, and will step up to every challenge with you.\n\n511#Implementation Maestro!|hi Rich I wanted to recognise all the excellent work you have done over the last few months on the multiple client implementations we have worked with you on in the branding team. You always run a very tight ship when it comes to scheduling and delivery of the Program sites and are on top of all aspects of the work driving both us and the client to deliver and sign off on work in a timely manner but still delivering the excellence we all expect. Your pleasant personality and inquisitive nature makes this process both fun and educational for both teams and we look forward to working with you on many more implementations to come.\n\n512#Pulling Together to Get WMC Proposal Out the Door|Dear Hillary, Nikki, Rich, Megan, and Lisa,  Thanks for the important contributions you each made during the holiday season to help me get the Westchester Medical Proposal finalized and submitted to the client for the January 4 due date. There were some unusual legal forms to review and sign, healthcare-related case studies to collect, design templates to create, and a triplicate hard copy final product to bind and ship out to a rather old-school customer. The final product looks great and will represent us well to WMC. Great team effort!  With much appreciation, James F.\n\n513#Ring the Gong!|Thank you for participating in the Gong ceremony! I appreciate that you took the time out of your schedule to share some information about our recent big program launches.\n\n514#Tech Savvy!|High five to you Rich for helping me overcome these recent obstacles with zipped data files, One drive, you name it. Your tech savvy talents have come to the rescue while our standard help desk folks are swamped. I came close to throwing my laptop off the Golden Gate Bridge... so thank you for taking the time to talk me out of it. Haha!\n\n515#Group Health - Lightning Fast Launch!|Outstanding job Rich! You have officially set the record for fastest launch to date with Group Health. FORTY SEVEN days from contract to launch and you technically didn't kick-off the relationship until 1 week after the contract was signed. Congratulations on an outstanding record breaking launch. Your organization, time management and ability to set expectations really paid off here. You kept everyone on track including the client which is no small feat! We all look forward to your continued record setting successes!\n\n516#Weekly reporting upgrade|Thank you Rich for the time and effort you have put into making the new weekly client report from salesforce available to us. Over a number of weeks, you kept me up to date with its progress and explained the plan for its implementation. I was able to get all my question's out of the way and you answered these without hesitation. Great work and thank you again!\n\n517#Proactive Information Sharing!|Rich, Thank you for being so proactive in sharing information on your new clients in Implementation. This information is extremely helpful from an operations perspective, as it enables the correct level of support to be put in place for each new client helping to deliver as seamless as possible launch experience for new clients and their employees - ultimately helping to deliver an exceptional employee experience Globally! Enjoy!\n\n518#Data Guide Sage|Rich, Your insight into how Customer Success interacts with clients on data files, and how best to support that through effective documentation was much appreciated. In addition the time end efforts to support the update, review, and ready for publication of documentation that best serves the CS team and their interactions with clients on the most tricky, and potential drag to implementation timelines will serve the team for quite some time to come.\n\n519#Grateful Gartner - Customer Compliment|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Quality!  Rich, all of your hard work, project management, attention to detail, super communications and relationship-building skills are shining through at Gartner!  One today's weekly call, Geronda Wollace said, \"Working through this program and process has been a great experience.\"  That statement was directed to you!  Her tone was very sincere and heartfelt.  Made me smile from ear to ear for you.  You're doing a great job with Gartner.  A company we certainly want to impress with our Globoforce high standards!  And you're doing that!  What's even more impressive is this compliment came during pre-launch, when customers are typically overwhelmed and in the mist of UAT times.  Well done - your a GloboStar!  All the best, Traci\n\n520#Amgen Workday Master|You did an amazing job, Rich on leading Amgen through their Workday migration. You've held the reigns since June as Liz went on mat leave and never looked back. You were poised and confident on our the calls with Amgen IT and their integration partner, Aon Hewitt. A truly well done migration for an important client. Congrats Rich!\n\n521#Quick Thinking!|Thank you both for your determination to find a fast solution for our friends at LinkedIn while I was out. You prevented a delay in their testing on the cloned site due to SSO / username issues with your ability to think outside the box. It was such a relief to see the last email in that chain from LinkedIn \"I am in! Thanks for your prompt response!\" Nice job!\n\n522#Great CRF testing|Thanks Rich for your help testing both the Cardinal Health service timelines for Canada and the reconfiguration of their eligibility rules.  These were complicated and you did a very thorough job of testing - thank you!\n\n523#First Launch|Rich, let me formally congratulate you on your first successful program launch at Globoforce - Destination Hotels!  I know it will be the first of many such successful recognition cultures you launch but the first one is always special.  I knew from the first day we met that you were a great fit here and were going to help us do special things.  So far so good! Well done and congratulations from me and the entire Globoforce family!\n\n524#Great teamwork!|Thank you very much for your assistance on the UHG award cancellation requests that came across my this morning. UHG experienced a spike in award abuse and needed to get these cancelled before their next payroll run (tonight). When I asked, without hesitation , you jumped right in to help me get the task completed. Thank you for the teamwork!\n\n525#Destination Hotels and BSBCMA|Rich, this is to recognise the great work you've been doing in managing both Destination Hotels and Blue Shield Blue Cross. Both clients have had their own challenges from trying to get approval on mockups to accessing image libraries but you followed up on everything promptly and obtained any assets we needed to complete branding ASAP. You also went that extra mile when you logged on - on a Sunday night!- to turn on the new nomination process for both clients so no time would be wasted. You're a great team player and I always enjoy working with you!\n\n526#Taking Charge|Thank you for taking charge by identifying an area of pain - automated data loads - collecting the questions,  researching the answers, and then pulling it all together in a proper format to share with the team. Your willingness to take a challenge and find a solution is greatly appreciated and the team now has a working FAQ on box to work off from and add to in the future.\n\n527#Icon Librarian|Rich, firstly your idea on how to have a better library of award reason icons in support of the new nomination process was excellent. But then you went above and beyond the call of duty by actually going ahead and making those updates yourself. I greatly appreciate it and the whole of the Customer Success Team will benefit immediate from this improvement.\n\n528#Holding the Fort and Recruiting Excellence|An event like WorkHuman can’t happen without the endless support of an entire team.  You are part of that team. Unfortunately, we can’t shut the company down for three days and I realize that it isn’t easy to be the one’s who keep our wonderful customer experience rolling at the office while the event happens.  However, make no mistake…your contribution was critical to the company’s success and to the success of WorkHuman.  You worked endlessly to recruit customers and we had almost double the number that came last year.  The feedback has been great and the benefits of those recruiting efforts will be felt for months.  You worked to cover for everyone who was away and did double duty.  We went through a tough technical issue and you held down the fort.  In case there was any doubt, your contribution was both noticed and worthy of recognition.  While it may not always seem obvious since we don’t see each other in person as often as we would like, please know that I am personally grateful for your efforts over the past few months in making WorkHuman happen.  You are appreciated.  Thank you and keep up the great work!\n\n529#Ear to ear smile!|I had breakfast with Lynn Boucher from Baystate Medical while at WorkHuman and she couldn’t say enough about her launch team of Christine, Rich and Lauren. She gushed over how great it’s been working with you, how knowledgeable you are and how flexible you’ve been with the unexpected delay on their side. Her smile was ear to ear the entire time when talking about her experience with Globoforce! Thank you for the excellent partnership and another happy customer!\n\n530#High Five for WestJet High Five!!!|Thank you so much for all of your support with the WestJet implementation.  I know I certainly learned a lot from the experience.  From config to UAT, it was so helpful having you on my go-to team while trying to figure everything.  I could not have done it without you.  HIGH FIVE!!!\n\n531#Thanks for your support!|Rich,  You have been providing exceptional work on several projects that we're working on together and have been a great team player.  Your technical background has been insightful and you've provided the clients with a comfort level that is essential during the launch process.  I also appreciate your support and enthusiasm when the client requested a demo for 80 team members.  It'll be a great session and I look forward to hosting it with you.  Keep up the great work!\n\n532#Awesome teamwork!|I wanted to thank you for jumping in to help revise text on LinkedIn's site. It was a tedious and time consuming task but with your help, it no longer felt so daunting! I have been impressed by how quickly you have gotten up to speed and love the initiative you have shown. In fact, I think I yelled that across the room the other day after eaves dropping on your conversation... haha! Regardless, nice work Rich!\n\n533#Client Implementation Reports|I'd like to say thank you for updating the spreadsheet every week. You've taken on board any changes which have occurred with the spreadsheet. It involved a torturous campaign on Sharepoint, but I feel that moving it to Box has worked a lot better for us. Also thanks for attending the Thursday morning meetings. These meetings are vital for myself, Stephen and UX team - and is great for keeping track of all dates.\n\n534#Newbie|Fantastic job on the Baystate call!! Your contribution on the call was insightful and very knowledgeable. You made the customer feel both welcome and excited about their new recognition program. It's like you have been working here for years. You are a great addition to the Launch Success Team. Keep up the good work.\n\n535#Continuous Improvement|I want to thank you for taking the initiative to find areas for improvement and acting on them without hesitation. While you are digging into our documents and processes as part of your on-boarding, you have found out tabs that need to be deleted on project plans and missing CSM's on branding forms just to name a couple as of recent. I appreciate your attention to detail and willingness to jump in and make corrections. Thank you.\n\n536#|I would like to bestow the 17Hour award upon all of you. I really appreciate your commitment and investment in making the kickoff a great success. If we can continue that level of enthusiasm, trust, respect and fun into 2006, we will surely dominate the space!    Thanks,  Debbie\n\n537#|Thanks so much for all your help sorting through Greg's prospects. I know it wasn't an easy task. And most importantly thank you for all of your support with Salesforce. You are very patient and willing to help whenever I need you. You ROCK!\n\n538#|First, I want to thank all of you for your efforts in the last US Team meeting in your innovation and contribution for the marketing contest.     Secondly, I want to apologize that you have not received this award on a more timely basis.    I appreciate your continued support in RAISING THE BAR!  Debbie\n\n539#|Thanks for helping me carry all the mail crates of full of Safeway to my car!\n\n"
