"0#Expert communicator|Dan, I want to commend you on your expert communication skills. With the recent fantastic news about a new customer case study, in the sharing the goodness, the email responses from WHiQ feeling out of the loop and like we jumped too quickly to share could have been taken in a negative way, and you neutralized the tone, listened, and responded beautifully. You invited them in, suggesting ways to be more collaborative, and finding solutions going forward.  I saw the back and forth, and appreciate how well you handled it. Communicating is a fine art and requires great skill, and you do it well.\n\n1#Morgan Truck Body - case study approved!|Dan, Jess - I really appreciate the collaboration and tenacity with this case study. Back in September, we identified an opportunity to bring Morgan Truck Body's verbal words from HR Tech and bring them to life in a case study document that sales and marketing teams could use in programs. You quickly jumped at our request for writing help and took ownership of the copy and relationship. Which included nudging (A LOT) Brady at Morgan Truck Body for approval for months. We finally got it. Kudos to you both. I can't wait to see this in the wild. What a great story of how a customer uses recognition for offline workers!\n\n2#Enablement Improvements|Dan and Jess - can't thank you enough for your assistance in reviewing and improving the Workhuman Live sales and customer enablement assets.  Dan, after a brief early morning conversation on low enablement usage, you immediately set up time for a group meeting to review and analyze our assets.  Jess, your recommendations on how to better present and streamline the assets will allow us to equip the teams with tools they can use to drive registrations.   Much appreciated!\n\n3#Seismic Wiz|Jess and Dan, I wanted to thank you both for helping me so many times with updating and uploading the most recent versions of the mid-market configuration calculators for the sales team to have access to on Seismic.

I am sure I will have new ones coming your way in 2023 :) thank you again for your help and happy new year!\n\n4#ABM Toolkits Phase 1 - Complete!|Jess and Dan - Thank you for your collaboration, consultation, and training as we navigated building and launching the first phase of our ABM toolkits in Seismic. I'm excited to work with both of you as we continue to build out these initial industry kits, and brainstorm new topics and ideas in the new year. I know these will be a great resource to our sales partners and others across the organization. Thank you again!!\n\n5#First Graduating Class of Spark Director+ !|Congratulations to our pilot class of Spark Director+, Workhuman's first-ever leadership development program catered specifically to our Director and Senior Director population!

This has definitely been a mentally taxing process, and without your teamwork it wouldn't have been possible.  All of the support fine tuning our presentation deck, deal strategy, pricing discussions, practice-practice-practice, the delivery of our finalist presentation during a challenging environment, and of course the post delivery navigation.  Working with this team makes me feel like I always have an advantage going into any opportunity, and I have a blast working with each one of you.  Thank you for your commitment to partnering on delivering the best experience for our future customers, and your partnership to me.  The only thing left to do at this point is receive some good news, and bring this story a very happy ending!\n\n8#Searching Seismic|Jess & Dan - Thank you so much for helping me find what I *thought* I was looking for in Seismic. I emailed Jess at 4:15pm looking for a case study that I thought existed and by 8am the next day, I had 4 different resources I could use instead from you both. Thank you for the team work and helping me get a better idea of the message I want to send!\n\n9#Seismic coverage|Dan, Amanda, Becca, and Julia – Thank you for your support while I was out on PTO and attending the Seismic conference.

Clearly something is in the water at OC Tanner because we're having a lot of conversations with their clients. What a great slide you've put together, highlighting the logos and hundreds of thousands of employees we've taken from them. I think we might need an employee slide of all the people that have come over next. Thanks for putting this together, I appreciate it!\n\n11#Helping share....what makes us different!|Dan, Joe, Nina and Laura thank you all for your efforts to help refine our messaging on what makes us unique in the marketplace.

Each one of you contributed your wisdom, expertise and thoughtful suggestions across a variety of topics. Your presence and participation made a huge impact on everything we’re trying to accomplish on the Left Coast. I know I speak on behalf of the entire team when I say we appreciate your support.\n\n13#Urgency for stories|Dan, I appreciate you pushing the Morgan Truck story through. It’s so refreshing to work with you again! Your follow up, your focus on a high quality outcome and ensuring we are all in the know- priceless. Thank you.\n\n14#Eyes and Ears|Dan - fantastic job with your efforts in traveling to HR Tech.  As always you were fully immersed, involved, and came away with a great deal of knowledge.  The brief you put together (complete with photos!!!)  did a fantastic job of bringing us into what it felt like to be there and gave us great perspective on the event attendees and our competitors there as well.  You went above and beyond to inform the leadership team of exactly what the takeaways from the conference need to be and how we can all learn from it.  Great work!\n\n15#News You Can Use – Seismic Leaderboard 09.21.2022|Dan, Clarissa, and Alex – Congratulations on snagging the top 3 spots on our Seismic performance leaderboard!

There are many aspects of how we work with clients that we want to ensure we highlight during the sales process. Some of these are product related and others are the strength of our launch and program impact. This team is working to highlight some of these key areas to help the entire sales team best position the impact we make for our prospective new clients. Can't want to see what this team develops!!\n\n17#News You Can Use – Story Contributors 08.24.2022|Team – Thank you for contributing your ideas, voices, and skills to the Aug. 24 issue of News You Can Use.

Much gratitude!\n\n18#Thank you for helping our team grow!|Thank you all for your time and efforts in finding and interviewing our new Customer Education Content Manager, Jillian! Everything came together for a smooth and ultimately successful process – from Daniella’s expert sourcing, the work it took to make this role “official,” thorough interviews and feedback discussions, selling Jillian on the value of WH, and a thoughtful approach to the right offer. It wouldn’t have happened without each of you. Thank you again for helping grow our small but mighty Customer Communications & Education team!\n\n19#data needed for board week.. thank you|Jen & Dan thank you both this week for helping pass along some analysis needed to help support the board discussions.

We're another step closer to creating a full proposal for our future joint clients!  Your quick turnaround also enabled me to present it during my Accenture meeting!  Thanks again for your support and giving it the proper care that will enable us to drive a successful joint GTM together!\n\n21#Competitive Intel|Brandon, thanks for sharing your knowledge to help us combat competitive traps as well as help us highlight the competitive differentiators we have. It is always extremely valuable to hear from folks who come from our space on how our competitors see us and how we should see ourselves, which can sometimes get foggy in the heat of battle. I also appreciated your perspective on the value of good discovery. Dan, thanks for your unwavering support in equipping the Midmarket team with the content, assets, and intel they need to close business. I appreciate having you as a partner.\n\n22#CHRO Moves|Dan - Fantastic initiative in working with and obtaining a new partnership to obtain recent CHRO moves as they happen.  We are only a few weeks into it and we are already seeing great results.  This is important to our organization as one of the most common themes in our wins is when former clients are involved.  The ability to see them move as it happens will go a long way to ensure we are working with the right people in the right place.\n\n23#Cheers to our First Global Workhuman Partner!|Team, THANK YOU for being a part of closing our very first global partner at Workhuman: Qualtrics!  Each of you played an essential role in helping throughout this partnership journey.  Your help brought us to where we needed to be, which included: shaping the story, advising on the process and people that need to be involved, coordinating the meetings, bringing our unique value and capabilities to life through presentations, creating a memorable experience for them, providing technical guidance, and formalizing the partnership through contract.  This partnership is the first of many, and the hard work begins here.  I couldn't have done this without you.  As I arrive at my first anniversary at Workhuman, I feel blessed to work with an amazing group of individuals (who also happen to be a lot of fun!).  Thank you again! 🥂 #WorkhumanTogether\n\n24#Counting Content|Team - Thank you for the agility and responsiveness to a recent request for a summary of content in key areas of focus.

Appreciate that this was all done expertly and within a 24 hour turnaround period! Onward! -C\n\n25#Alexander Zimmerman, Sr.|Dan,  unbelievable job in gaining competitive intel from one of our great competitors.  In assuming your AKA identity you were able to gain great insights into what one of our competitors is doing as well as one of our more desired prospects.  On top of that you were able to capture and present back to the business all the relevant information.  thanks for always going above and beyond!!\n\n26#Coming through in a pinch!|Jess, Amanda and Dan, thanks so much for stepping up last minute to create some content for our meeting w/Rentokil.  The little details matter and when we came to you with a problem, you delivered timely and with quality.  Thanks so much for proving once again, that we work with the best team in the business!!\n\n27#Videographer|Dan, thank you for being the videographer to capture the #momentsthatmatter. Who knew so much could happen before the work day started on a Wednesday morning?!  This couldn’t have been made possible without you. Thank you!!\n\n28#It takes a Workhuman village! (part 2)|Last week was the culmination of the efforts by so many to bring the Executive Forum to life at Workhuman Live. Joining the team only 6 weeks before the event, I was blown away by the work ethic, camaraderie, and creativity of everyone involved. Your support, encouragement, and tireless commitment to the finished product (both during the final stretch of planning and onsite) far exceeded anything I could have ever imagined in a team, and your efforts were instrumental in delivering an impactful program for ExF members. Thank you for bringing the vision to life. It was a sincere pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.  With the craziness of the event, I fell a bit behind with recognition in the final 2 weeks leading up to the event. Please know - your contributions did not go unnoticed.   SCDs and Sales Teams – for your diligent efforts to fill the room and empower the most important Customers and Prospects to join the conversation. These efforts not only contributed to the success of this event, they also helped lay the foundation for future events and further development of our business relationships.   Meghan, Chris W, and Dave – for your diligent work facilitating and tracking customer experience and the growth account participation. I appreciate your keen eyes on the process!   Corina and Dana – for your collaborative efforts in integrating the Partner Program elements into the ExF experience and for your timely action in helping to lock in details ahead of our internal deadlines. Also, for your leadership and companionship as co-hosts of the Bellyard breakfasts and enthusiasm throughout the onsite experience. Your input during the breakfast conversations added real value to the attendees’ experiences. It was a delight to watch you in action!  With tremendous thanks for your involvement and contribution to this process – congratulations on a job well done! Onward to Dublin!\n\n29#Crayon Overview|Dan, thanks so much for taking our global demand gen and ABM teams through an overview of Crayon yesterday!

Really appreciate your time and for sharing those helpful resources with us following the meeting!\n\n30#A pleasure to deal with!|Thank you for always being so pleasant and helpful Dan! You were one of the first people I worked on a project with when I joined Workhuman which was a wonderful introduction to the company culture here, and since then you've been so quick to offer advice and answers any time I come to you with a random question. Thank you not only for the latest answer but for those that have gone before also!\n\n31#Ain't nothing like getting together.....|Team - that was SO much fun, thank you to each and every one of you. It's a great company to work for, but what makes it even more special is the people. New and familiar faces bring all kinds of opportunities to connect, and I'm grateful I got the opportunity to spend time with all of you! Go, Sox!\n\n32#Top-notch, organized customer content|Sales enablement team- just wanted to give the three of you a shout out for the incredible work you've done churning out great content and keeping it all organized and easy to find in Seismic. The customer webinar clips you create are going to be leveraged on social and the customer story slides were so helpful for a quick-turn request I just received for Workhuman Live. It's comforting to know there's always one source of truth in Seismic that doesn't require much digging to find! Thank you!\n\n33#Building Our Story|Team, Thank you for your help and support on the Accenture partnership workshop and your thought leadership.  It was a tight timeline with lots of materials needed.  I feel so fortunate to work with this team that's not afraid to roll up their sleeves and think big together.  Each of you played an important part in building out our story and shaping the opportunities ahead.  Thank you for understanding and seeing the importance of the workshops and activities.  There will be much more to come.  Thank you for being a part of this journey with me!\n\n34#Master of Words|Dan, Thank you for all your help revising the written content for the Accenture partnership materials.  You are the master of words and were able to illustrate the importance of our story together in a powerful way.  Also, thank you for the urgency on this as we were preparing for the meeting.  I greatly appreciate you prioritizing this!  You enabled me to be well-prepped for a good review with Brian.  Thanks so much!\n\n35#O'Canada - Getting After it!|Dan and Amanda, wow, wow and wow.  When we met a couple weeks back to discuss making our sales content more \"in country specific\" we thought you and Amanda could help.  But, what you both came back with yesterday was far and away more impressive than we could have hoped for.  The new Canada\"ish\" slides you built will create a competitive advantage for Jessie, Ankur and Julia, and we know there is more greatness on the horizon.  Thanks for listening and taking our rough ideas and putting them into action.  It's great to work with people as talented as both of you.  THANK YOU!!\n\n36#Workhuman Plays Offense|Team - I wanted to celebrate how I excited I am coming off today's Sales All Hands Launch call for the kick off our \"Unseat Achievers\" campaign next week. This has been a true team effort across several Sales and Marketing motions. What's more, the partnership has generated great coordination in our launching with a \"big bang\" approach of paid search, display and BDR outreach. It's also create a great opportunity to sharpen and be more provocative with our messaging, while capturing competitive insights. I appreciate the careful, and speedy planning that's gotten us to a great place on the eve of next week's launch. Excited to monitor learnings and continue to dynamically manage the plan together for growth against our shared goals.

Dan, the way that you helped me to think and strategically word the benefits was an amazing learning experience for me.  I am lucky to work with both of you!\n\n39#Geisinger asset document|Amanda/Dan - I came to you with a vision, with a specific ask of what we needed to convey in the document. You both truly delivered on the details, my vision, and the attention to detail we were looking for. Not only did you take the content I provided and make it your own, but you also delivered it in a way that tells a true story of why we are the partner for Geisinger, I'm so grateful to work with you both. And this is something we can use with the countless other healthcare prospects I am engaged with within my territory, but also across the company. Kudos for a remarkable job!\n\n40#Leading From the Front|Jess, Michael, and Dan -  we are all so fortunate to have you as our leaders in Operations.

Your design skills are so appreciated and took it up a notch.\n\n42#Company strength slide!|This week we had Steve Cromwell on the sales all hands call. During the session Steve highlighted some of the many ways we are a strong company and invest in our clients. Dan, Amanda & Mark jumped on those topics and developed a slide (and talk track) to help the field. Excellent work!\n\n43#SKO Partnership|Amanda, Jess, Dan - thank you so much for all of your help and support with the 2022 SKO! Amanda, you jumped in right from day 1 with your wonderfully creative mind to develop the slide deck and the wins video. Jess, I literally called you the night before to help co-pilot the technology on the back-end and you agreed without hesitation. Then the two of you quickly helped package it up and get it into Seismic right away. And Dan, I always appreciate your detailed eye to make sure the whole thing comes together! Thank you team for everything!!\n\n44#|Dan you have worked diligently for the last month to put together slides that tell customer stories in a compelling way. This effort pushes the slide library that much further. Way to go on focusing on telling the customers story correctly and in a interesting way!\n\n45#Integration Collaboration|Each of you took the time to provide thoughtful connections, introductions, and ideas on how I can add insight and quality to a piece of content initially intended for a narrow audience.

In 2021 we have all had our share of obstacles and an extremely demanding set of deadlines and projects.   You have led all of those efforts with grace and made sure your teams had everything they need to deliver.  You have also done a fantastic job expanding and building your teams to what they are right now - and not just in team members, but it in terms team function.  We are now responsible for more than ever and your ability to lead from the front of that change has been inspiring.  Lastly, you have all prepared for the future.  Each of you have come up with great strategies for 2022 and how to bring even more to the company.  I thank each of you for your leadership and look forward to what 2022 has in store!!!!\n\n48#Take Aways and TAKING ACTION!!!|Dan and Jess - phenomenal job today running through your takeaways and initiatives from the Q4 QBR's.  You attended almost every single one, and you participated, listened, and more importantly, have already started action items.   You have already begun to shape some materials that can help everyone out now, and that is fantastic.  Its great having you with our group now, listening, hearing, and then helping us take action.  Great job!!\n\n49#Bringing in a Rock Star!|Team, Thank you for your support in being a part of the interview panel (and being on standby) and guidance throughout this process!

This is a new adventure with endless possibilities!\n\n50#Slam dunk on the IBM webinar|Team, I wanted to say thank you for doing such a great job on the recent IBM webinar promotions. Every contribution went a long way to drive one of our most highly registered-for webinars of the year. With over 900 people registered, and a 42% attendance rate, it surely was a hit! And sometimes, it the smallest things, like adding a “webinar tab” to our tile cards and social ads, that can make the biggest impact. I appreciate everyone on this team constantly putting forth their best efforts, making suggestions to try new things, for being open to feedback, and for being great partners. Webinars are one of the major MQL contributors and meeting drivers for Sales – I can’t wait to see what this one brings in! Thank you all.\n\n51#Real Time Sales Enablement|Dan and Amanda - One of the biggest advantages to now having this group over with sales is the exposure we can get and the immediate impact we can have in real time.  In attending a QBR recently it was brought up that some fresh, more descriptive collateral around our Global capabilities could really help an ongoing deal we were close to the finish line on.  The two of you immediately went into action, creating not only something needed for that future customer, but something we can scale accordingly to the rest of the team.  Thank you for always looking for ways to help out and support the sales efforts!\n\n52#Beyond Grateful|Dan & Amanda, I have to take a quick moment to share my sincere gratitude for all the outstanding assets you both have been producing for the sales organization in recent weeks. I feel so incredibly supported, from the continued collaboration around understanding and improving the slides we use as SA's on sales calls to the outstanding Merck videos (and soon IBM videos) - you both do such important and collaborative work. Thank you!!\n\n53#Merck videos|Dan, A huge thank you and shout out for working with our amazing Merck story. I truly appreciate your partnership in taking the content and making it effective for sales. THANK You for recognizing its value for sales, leading the charge and making smaller cuts happen to really impact our sales efforts. Merck tells a great story and we've captured that nicely. You've taken the spirit and made it work for your teams. Massive thank you, Dan. It's appreciated.\n\n54#9/27 Marketing Newsletter Trivia Winners|Thanks for reading and participating in the marketing newsletter!\n\n55#Onboarding Dream Team!|Having a solid onboarding process is absolutely critical right now as the needs of the business are growing and changing. And if we think about all the connections that we make for our prospects with recognition - increased retention, boosting productivity, engagement, inclusivity...well, it's the same for onboarding! Each of you has played a key role in really dissecting what we do today and how we can be even better. As you know, doing the proper analysis (think discovery calls!) is so important to do upfront before we just go and build. Angela, you kept us all organized with your notetaking and I look forward to mapping out a project plan with you! Mary Jo, your support leading up to this was extremely helpful, taking the time to organize the session and make the most out of our 2 hours together. Dan, you and your team have already done so much work to contribute to onboarding improvements! We will identify some key focus areas and partner with you on developing additional assets. And Bashir, Lori, Jonathan, Sameer, and Ann-Marie - each of you offered valuable suggestions and feedback, some things which we can start to implement right away, others which might take some time to build out! Nonetheless, you were there - engaged in the discussion, committed to making change, all while balancing EOQ responsibilities, too. I can't thank each and every one of you enough. I am so grateful!\n\n56#Creating with Crayon|Dan,  I am so grateful for you/to you!  Thank you for taking the time to meet with me, listen to my suggestions in the Features Comparison for our Competitive Intelligence and taking all of the additional time to shift, sort and update the \"Details\" column.  There is a lot of great information in the Field Intel section- yet often, there is not enough time to read through the notes that are there.  All that you have done with Crayon and Seismic is so, so very much appreciated by the entire Sales team.  Thank you for all you do to support us!!!\n\n57#Thank you for your leadership!|Dan, on this World Gratitude Day, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you. Your leadership has been instrumental in the creation and success of our small but mighty sales enablement team, and I feel lucky that I've had you as my manager for my entire Workhuman tenure. You're focused, dedicated, humble, a valued second set of eyes, and a strong strategic thinker with a knack for developing connections across teams. You were brave to start a new department nearly ten months ago now, and I'm grateful that you brought me along to help breathe life into your vision for a content engine for sales. With the addition of Amanda and paired with support from Mark V. and sales ops as a whole, we've made massive strides with Seismic, competitive intelligence, customer stories, product-focused materials, and ensuring that we have content for all our reps – including those working internationally – to use with prospects. Thank you for your unwavering support and belief in our mission. You're a real gem!\n\n58#Sales All Hands Best Practice Sharing|Dan, Lisa, Lori and Corina thank you for sharing insights with the sales team today.

I know your vision was one place where we can finally find things and just wanted to tell you know, that is becoming the case more and more, and is greatly appreciated.  I wanted to make sure I told you directly, because heaven knows I was plenty willing to complain to you about the lack of findability in the past, and love to see us turning the corner.   😉  Thank you, I greatly appreciate and am benefiting from all your efforts!\n\n60#Always something new with this guy!!!|Dan,  it has been amazing the level of excellence you have brought to the sales org since joining in January, and its unbelievable the amount of content and tools you all put out what seems like every day.  Something new came out as I was writing this!!  You have done a fantastic job building your team and empowering them to do their best work.  We have thrown a lot at you in 2021, a lot of things that never quite could cross the finish line, and you picked up the baton and ran with it.  Thank you so much you do for all of sales!\n\n61#Better Educating to Our Future Customers|Dan, Amanda, Jess, Alan, Mark, Dave, Hari, Marcy, Corinne, Naomi, Meisha-Ann, Cam, Jay, Melanie, Amanda and Sarah - I wanted to take a moment to appreciate each of your contributions this past quarter as they've been key to developing assets that better educate our future customers.

Alan, Mark, Dave & Hari: I want to thank you for the relentless focus you bring to each of our WHiQ slide reviews; your diverse perspectives and ability to communicate complexity in simple terms is what makes these meetings so informative and productive! Last but not least, Marcy, Corinne, Naomi, Meisha-Ann, Cam, Jay, Melanie, Amanda and Sarah, thank you for your deep partnership helping to create a number of new slides (soon to be made available on seismic) that beautifully illustrates what a 3 year partnership with Workhuman entails. Together, we've made so much progress - yet our work is seemingly never done...always something we can further improve upon. That being said, I wanted to hit pause and take this moment to let each of you know how truly grateful I am for your friendship and continued partnership, all in service of better educating our future customers!\n\n62#Seismic for sales team|Dan & Jess I want to thank both of you for your hard work to build out our library of items on Seismic.

You're always quick to respond and ready to help when needed.  I've been reading through a lot of Workhuman material, and it turned out the best ones I found were written by YOU!  Your writing is eloquent, and you can create a beautiful story to describe areas within our business.  You write the poetry of Workhuman!  Also, thank you for sending additional material that you think would be relevant for me.  You've been so helpful to get my feet grounded.  Thank you!\n\n64#All hands for the All Hands|I am grateful to each and every one of you for your part in delivering the Quarterly Sales All Hands v2.0.

Amanda - I love that you get me...taking my concept and delivering fun and dynamic visuals. I appreciate your patience and perseverance through many edits and agenda changes.  Dan - my beacon through my storm, ready to be my backup, testing, prepping, and also being an excellent reflector to content, speakers, theme, images, everything. Thank you.  Steph, Daisy & Sharon, thanks for helping me handle multiple details, gathering data, logistics, and SP -- loved your question to SLT at the end, beautiful! Jason, Corina, Mark, thank you for sharing rich content, helping build and shape it so we delivered meaningful impactful information backed by stats to help drive momentum.  Dave! our VIP: hearing from you was a special treat. You gave us stories to use with future customers re: how they will grow, backed by evidence, plus insight to customer-only accessible education from which we can create FOMO. The Celebrations data proved a hit; two are planning to use it upcoming finalist presentations, brilliant!  Mike, I can always count on you for being game to have a little fun. Thanks for laying down the beard challenge, this will be fun to build towards in 2H'21. Tom, the video was great! I know it's not your favorite to get in front of the camera, plus you didn't need one more item before heading out on vacation. But, it wouldn't be a Sales All Hands w/o you, and I appreciate your bringing energy and a winning spirit to close out our content.  Lastly, a second shout out to you Jason, for trusting my leadership to build this key messaging quarter over quarter, and giving me free rein to try different ideas to keep it fresh. I appreciate your support.\n\n65#Stay Calm and Execute|It has been great having this team integrate into the sales organization, and your efforts don't go un-noticed.  This specific recognition is tied to a couple recent requests on 'Why Workhuman' and 'Financials'.  There are so many people vying for your time, but you take the time to listen to our needs, prioritize, and find a way to execute on those requests.  Thank you so much for your ongoing support!\n\n66#RINGMASTER|Dan,  What a journey!  When you first moved over to sales and we discussed the possibilities of giving sales access to slides and materials like never before it really did seem like an uphill battle.  We both saw the greatness that could come of it.  I cant thank you enough for spearheading the efforts to get everything collected, updated, and curated in one place.  At times it was like herding cats, but you did a phenomenal job always moving things forward.  No matter what else being worked on or trying to be completed by other deadlines, you stayed true to this vision.  I love how it came out, and I look forward to all the other ideas we still have for this project.  Thanks for all you do!\n\n67#Seismic slide library!|Dan, Amanda & Jess I want to thank each of you for the great work on the Seismic slide library for the sales team. Looks great to have all the decks in one place that can easily be viewed and sorted. This is really helpful to help give the team the information they need to help best position Workhuman. Thank you!\n\n68#Out with old, in with the new!!|Team,  I cant say enough about the planning, effort and execution into transforming the ability for sales to access ALL our slides.   We were looking to solve for a few things.  #1 convert the most popular and valuable slides to our new look and updated messaging.   #2 discover and collect the great one of slides that have been built over the years but have remained almost secretive.  #3 create new slides that sales has always wanted or needed.  This group worked tirelessly over the last 6 months.  Interviews with reps, working with marketing, creative and product, and the list goes on and on.  It was great to see it go up live today on Seismic and it looks great!  As we keep saying, its an ongoing journey and we have many slides to go, but we are on the right path!\n\n69#So glad you've joined sales!|Dan, Jess, and Amanda - I'm beyond thrilled you three are a part of the sales organization! Already, in my short time back from maternity leave, we've encountered countless projects and opportunities where we are/will partner together. I'm so grateful to get to work with each of you! I can always trust that you'll follow through with your action items and that all work will be done with a detailed, creative, and caring eye. You are all amazing at what you do and your efforts are truly a value-add to me and to this organization. Thank you again!!\n\n70#Celebrating the early-stage Accenture tiger-team!|With the recent win and celebration of the Accenture deal closing, I wanted to be sure this team’s efforts way back in 2017 was not forgotten. Many moons ago creating very targeted videos and demos for Accenture, this team crafted scripts, beautiful demo experiences and created multiple videos (including messages from Eric, and a gorgeous day-in-the-life video of an Accenture employee living and breathing our solution) for the early stages of the Accenture deal. Often working around the clock and partnering with our allies within Accenture (Jim Ivey, Aishwarya Sundar, and Dawn Stupar) we were able to target very specific language and a narrative that resonated with them when we couldn’t be in the room. So here’s to celebrating the early birds who laid some of the critical foundations of success we all get to celebrate today.\n\n71#Ahhh...That's Refreshing!|I'm so grateful to have teammates that truly want to help each other out, no matter if it's a big or small ask.  Over the past couple days I had requested your assistance to help me create a memorable moment that matters for an upcoming presentation on Monday.  You absolutely delivered, and I can't thank you enough!!!\n\n72#Competitive Tiger Teams|What a great session today on our sales call! Both teams brought compelling points to the table and had me on the edge of my seat. At first, have to say, I was uncomfortable listening to how the Tigers from Scott-land laid out the easy to do business argument...every point had me writing down a list so I could wait for the Cassidy Tigers to counterpoint.  In the course of the hour, I jotted down lots of notes, and Lisa, I love your question relating to Shared Success, \"Ever made a decision where all the risk was based on You?\" Good one, I felt that!    Adoption v. Engagement, Simplicity v. Solving a Business Problem,  Points-driven platform v. Strategic Talent Driven Platform....Great work, you gave all of us a lot to think about, and I appreciate the time spent to prepare a solid, compelling hour of content and kudos to Amanda & Dan for laying it out in a simple digestible format for us to use and refer back to. I'm looking forward to part 2 to finish the conversation and then see everything put into practice. This is a training that we can bookmark and use time and time again, as a refresher, a reminder to get in early, and as new people join the team.   Well done Tigers!\n\n73#Workhuman Superheroes!|If there ever was a superhero team at Workhuman, this team would be it!  Mark, you used your superpowers to rally in the right individuals to bring together the help that I needed so I could have the right set of tools to hit the ground running quickly.  You were so fast to respond and send out the meeting invites with the right team members, I had to double-check if you or I had sent the email first!  Jess H, Dan, Chris, and Jess R, with each of your special powers and expertise, we'll be able to 'partner' with some other superheroes and move at lightning speed!\n\n74#Jumping on quickly!|Dan, thanks for the immediate assistance earlier today when I was trying to locate some key materials to arm my prospect with. Thanks for jumping all over this, I do appreciate it! Cheers Dan\n\n75#It takes a village|Team - creating a corporate overview deck that elevates and integrates the brand, business, and solution story is always a long process of trial and error.  You each have put in so much of your blood, sweat, tears, joy, laughter - and best of all - humanity into this project.  Thank you for never giving up and for always coming back to the table with renewed energy and resilience.  So proud to work with you!\n\n76#The Long Haul|Dan, I just want to say how impressive it was to see your process in putting together the new Achievers documents. Although it took a lot of efforts from a lot of people, you were the driving force behind making sense out of so many moving parts.   You made sense of many differing thoughts and opinions and put it in a cohesive flow that makes sense. In addition, YOU GOT US NEW STUFF!!!  Haha. I cant wait for everyone to see it and start using it!\n\n77#Always in marketing|Dan, I cannot count the times over the last few weeks I have reached out with 'hey, remember that thing...\"  Thank you for being such a terrific partner to the marketing team, even when your role has shifted into sales. You exemplify the meaning of teamwork! Cheers to you!\n\n78#Always Having Our Back|Dan, wanted to recognize you for continuously being supportive of me and the team.  There have been quite a few moments in recent memory, but one that sticks out is that I asked a question via slack, and within a few minutes you had supporting docs delivered to my inbox so I could get ahead of a project for next week.  Thank you for being a consummate team player!\n\n79#You put Spring in my step|Thank you team! I very much appreciate the help, dedication, preparation and execution in the past weeks leading up to today's All Hands. We developed the agenda, built content, created visuals, dealt with final logistics...no matter what the ask, you all dedicated time and energy to deliver and make it seamless. And Aaron, wow - above and beyond to commit and join us from your vacation too!This felt a lot like when we prep for a prospect presentation, so now we wait for the feedback to learn if we were downselected, got VOC or earned the win! 😉   Thanks again the help ~ I really appreciate the teamwork! (and I'm sure you all appreciate that I didn't continue down my corny path of puns...they don't 'succ'...all I could do not to weave in how y'all were just dandy putting the petal to the metal...)\n\n80#Editing Squad|You both made this transition super seamless. I was able to jump right into designing the deck for our All-Hands Sales Meeting week one with minimal knowledge about sales or Workhuman. You worked with me to get the correct information and provided me with essential edits, which improved the presentation. Thank you for making this first project a great start to my time at Workhuman.\n\n81#Fast as lightning|Thank you to this group of humans for the SPEEDY access to a Seismic. I have big goals for this and next quarter and within minutes I had access to the tool to start digging in and planning. I really appreciate the superhuman speed at which you supported me so I can support Sales. On this day of employee appreciation, I hope you know how much I appreciate you!\n\n82#THANK YOU FOR THANKING|Thank you all for your video submission for Employee Appreciation Day! While this day provides a wonderful reminder for all of us to reflect on the efforts and innovation that each of our humans bring to the table - we all know that our spirit of recognition and celebration is one that lives on all year long. There is no greater example of this in action than the recent call for video submissions from people leaders for an Employer Brand campaign. When we asked for some videos from people leaders thanking their team members, we were OVERWHELMED with video submissions - much more than we could incorporate into one or two snippet videos!  Your videos will remain live for all your team mates to see (see slack for link). Thank you all so much for taking the time to show your gratitude and enhancing our culture further. Even in this remote world you are all creating moments that matter, so thank you.\n\n83#Spinning Plates!|Dan,  I just want to say that its been very impressive to witness the command of all that you have going on.  There are a lot of things, spread across the whole company, that require a lot of work and a lot of next steps.  I appreciate the accountability, responsiveness, and ability to always rally team members together and push next steps along.  With all we are trying to achieve this year, I cant think of anyone better to be spearheading so many important things.\n\n84#Competitive Intelligence Focus|Dan thank you for your focus to help improve our competitive intelligence. First we need to collect everything we have and package it up in a way that can be useful. We also need to add in the pricing and positioning details that make it truly impactful. Appreciate your efforts and look forward to your results.\n\n85#Seismic and instant help|Dan and Jess - one, congrats again on your recent move internally! Two, and the reason for my Spark to you - both of you are always nearly INSTANT when it comes to helping out or answering questions. I asked you this morning to help one of our new hires out getting setup with Seismic, it was done in minutes. Recently I had some questions for you guys on content, Seismic, and few other related things and again, almost instant to respond and get me what I needed and on my way. It's truly game changing to get help and answers so quickly when we're trying to get things done. I truly appreciate it and you both as I know the whole sales org does. Thank you!\n\n86#DE&I Exellence|Dan and Jess,  thank you so much for the hard work you both put into building out new collateral for the Sales Team around DE&I.  The messaging, the graphics, and the information was outstanding.  It now gives the entire team the tools to have a great conversation with future customers as well as giving them the knowledge needed for the topic to have an educated conversation.  You have only just started with Sales but you both are already making such a great impact.  Thank you!\n\n87#News You Can Use - Story Contributors|Brian, Chris, Dan, Jen, Jenn, & Tim; We couldn't have a best-in-class newsletter without fine folks like yourselves who put themselves out there and share what great looks like. Thank you for taking time out of your day to share what is working! Much gratitude!\n\n88#No wine, but lots of wisdom|Jen, Rob and Dave, thank you so much for taking the time to provide your perspectives on the latest HR trends during our recent brainstorming session. Your individual passions for the topics we discussed are quite evident and your insights are invaluable. They not only help us to keep our pulse on the market, but they go a long way in helping to shape our content strategy for demand gen initiatives and beyond. Dan and James, as always, your contributions and viewpoints added extra flavor to the discussion – I could tell the wheels were already spinning on what new content assets we could create based on our discussions. I’m exited to see where we take things next!\n\n89#From Marketing Colleagues to Value Partners|Dan and Jess,  We want to take a moment to thank you both for the significant impact you made in Marketing.  Long before Chris and I joined Workhuman, you two created incredible content that demonstrated our thought leadership in the market.  Over the past year, you each have adapted to a crazy ever-changing B2B marketing landscape, creating the solid foundation from which we will continue to launch our noise-breaking content.  Your dedication to our company, our team, and our customers is one with everlasting impact.  While we miss you in Marketing, we are excited for the incredible impact you will make in sales enablement.  Here's to an amazing year of partnership ahead of us.\n\n90#WH Content Librarians|Dan and Jess, I wanted to recognize you for your support and guidance on the many content items cropping up early this year.  Your willingness to dive in and track things down while providing oversight has been valuable not only as a learning experience, but also in moving the projects forward.  Thank you for your partnership!\n\n91#Out of the Gates Hot!!|Dan, we are truly lucky to have you over in the sales org now. In your first week you became the most popular topic and person to reach out to!  Just as you have always done, you dove right in and made an immediate impact right away.  There are a lot of projects on the table and you have come with great ideas, perspective and insights into how to best get them done. We are lucky to have you and we all look forward to working with you more closely!\n\n92#Dream Team|Team- what an incredible ride we have had this year!  When I think about all of the work we have done together, all of the groundwork we have laid, as a team, to create the iconic brand we know we are - I am in awe.  Each of you has stretched yourselves, tried new and intimidating tasks and responsibilities, and have never lost your grace and humanity. I am proud to work alongside you and to call you my friends.  Happy Holidays to you all.  Here's to an even better, out-of-this-world 2021!!\n\n93#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n94#Thanks for your help with video series|Just a little note to say thank you for set up & execution of the great video content that we have managed to set up in the past.  We have gained access to top exec's at great logo's like Unilever, Ericsson and Standard Chartered in the CHRO series.  The Keeping Work human  video's helped to get conversations going with other organizations when Covid was peaking in Europe. Thanks again for all the work involved in putting these together.\n\n95#Seismic Recording|Thank you for taking the time to partner on the Seismic Workday training recording. It was great working through this with you and I appreciate the extra time you took out of your day to help support this initiative.\n\n96#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n97#Pivot and Proceed!|Thank you both for your quick response and strategic insight to launch a recap of the Evanta UK CHRO Town Hall to attendees. It was great to work together to balance timeliness with content effectiveness, in order to provide attendees with key messages and learnings from the event. I appreciate your willingness to pivot on a plan, share solutions based on best practices, and take action quickly, in order to provide our sales team with the necessary information for their follow-up. Appreciate your team work here!\n\n98#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n99#Certified Bug Hunters!|I wanted to take a moment to call out this amazing group of humans for answering the call to hunt for bugs as we test the Workhuman Certified Enterprise website and platform. This team went above and beyond, bringing a critical eye to all areas of the program and providing so much amazing feedback that will help us improve our customer experience, site performance and messaging at launch and beyond. Thank you!\n\n100#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n101#Making Work Human Book Published Today!|Today is launch day!  Making Work Human.  And the first thing to say is THANK YOU to you and indeed to all of Workhuman, because this book is our story, our experiences, our client case studies, our insights from the data, our reflections and years of working together, put into a book.   It takes village to publish a book, and we want to call out and recognize the core book publishing team and those who played a pivotal role at a pivotal moment.  Doug Hardy, Kevin Mullins, Dan Miller, Lynette Heelan, Jessica Klay, Carrie Rogers, Maureen Buxton, and all of whom worked directly on the content and project management for this book, professionals in every way, without whom this day would not have been possible.  Thank you all for making a difference in the world and bringing this book to be published today.\n\n102#🙌🏻 Upleveling our Team Updates 🙌🏻|Week in and week out, each of you contribute to a few different communication vehicles we have to keep our team and stakeholders across the company up to date on all the amazing things that are happening in the world of Marketing. About a month or so ago, I came to the team with a new process for pulling together our weekly updates and challenged each of us to think about the intended audience and what would be most valuable to them...We started including more metrics and other performance data in our look-backs and introduced headlines to provide more focus. We are also incorporating more visuals to keep the content fresh and engaging. We held each other accountable to sticking to a standard template and hitting deadlines so that we could get the updates edited and out the door in a timely fashion. I know between the weekly marketing updates, the digital programming status reports and ELT progress updates, you probably feel like this is communication overload at times, but they are important in staying connected and current especially when we are all remote. I sincerely appreciate your part in helping to improve the quality. THANK YOU!\n\n103#Thanks for always having a minute.|Dan, really appreciate how you and your team are always there to lend a hand even with little to no notice. The most recent example is you stepping in to guide content and streamline production of Patti's \"Have a Minute?\" series. Thank you for being the consummate team player and a shining example of selfless leadership!\n\n104#Moving Moments|Thank you all for playing an integral role in our Change Management workshop to work through how to effectively roll out DG 2.0 to sales. Your input will help inform the strategy and ensures we are taking your day-to-day processes into account when working through all of these new initiatives. Thank you again for dedicating a few hours of your day to this discussion and ensuring a solid partnership between marketing and sales.\n\n105#Evanta Follow-Up Fortitude|Your thoughtful and creative efforts lead to a multi-pronged follow-up approach from our Evanta D, E, & I virtual town hall - reaching such an important audience. Within one day of the event, you created a blog post, updated landing pages to make the book available to these attendees, provided video solutions, organized and customized campaigns, and launched outreach in a timely manner to aid sales in their outreach efforts. Your willingness to go above and beyond in such a short timeframe is valued and appreciated, while your level of detailed communication led to the production of impactful, meaningful content that will have the greatest impact on this program.\n\n106#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n107#Customer Stories Squad!|Team! Thank you so much for the partnership on curating our latest customer stories into a single spot. With new folks constantly joining the organization, its so critical we streamline these pieces of content to get the most mileage of out them. So thrilled the team was able to think outside of the box and develop an interim solution that will help us keep organized ahead of Seismic launch in the fall. GO TEAM and so excited to begin phase 2 of this project.\n\n108#Content Power Team!|Dan, Sarah, and Jess - This is so overdue, and I wanted to recognize you on your teamwork and willingness to always help with ANY request that comes in from the marketing teams. Whenever we're trying to identify scope and content pieces, your collaboration is so appreciated and we're always able resolve so quickly. Your team produces such impactful work, and it's been a pleasure working with you all!\n\n109#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n110#Teamwork Makes the Content Work|Team! Thanks so much for taking a good chunk of your time this week to discuss content mapping for customers in Q3 and beyond. It was such a productive and thoughtful conversation. Everyone came to the meeting with thoughts and ideas and I cannot thank Dan, Sarah and Jess enough for being so open minded, honest and putting the customer experience first! I'm excited to test, learn and continuously improve. Go team!\n\n111#Seismic here we come...|Chris and Dan, I wanted to call out the speed of help and support I received from both of you this past week.  I hopped onto an implementation call thinking this was nice information to have not realizing that Customer Success was part of the roll-out and I would have some homework.  Without hesitation you both jumped into action.  Chris, the very next day you spent some time walking me through the product to ensure I had a general understanding of what Seismic was and its capabilities.  Dan, that day you ensured we had a demo scheduled with me and a smaller Team to ensure we understood the product, expectations and next steps..not to mention the homework deliverables  :)  Thank you both for taking time out of your already busy schedules to help bring me up to speed.  This is going to be a huge win for Sales, Customer Success and WH as a whole!!!\n\n112#Collaboration at its finest|Dan and Jess, thank you both for being patient and open-minded with the feedback we had on a recent content asset to be used in our demand gen campaigns. You could have chosen to be frustrated that we were straying from the original direction, but instead you welcomed the feedback and we had an extremely collaborative and productive discussion. I love that we were all able to hit the pause button and take a few steps back to figure out the best way forward. The original asset was good, but the enhancements we’re going to make will really help it resonate with our target audience. I have no doubt we’re going to knock this one out of the park! Thanks for the collaboration, for being open to receiving feedback and for the continued partnership between our teams!\n\n113#Measurement for success|A bit late but I wanted to thank you all for your dedication, collaboration, and teamwork as we solidified measurements for Awareness, Perception and Preference. Learning and listening to each other through every meeting, I saw such great passion for accuracy and full transparency in the unknown. We worked together to present solid recommendations, and received great feedback. With our next steps to operationalize, use Q1-Q2 2020 as litmus on measurements, and prepare for QBRs together we'll create the best measurable Brand marketing we've ever had. I couldn't be more proud of this team.\n\n114#You've got this covered.|Thank you to this team for comprehensive coverage of our session at Total Resilience. Dan and Sarah, thank you for building the conference into the overall content plan and for moving up the promotion post to give more time to promote Rob’s session. Aaron, thank you for pulling together the promotion blog that shared our overall presence at the event. Sarah, thank you for attending the session and writing a follow-up post that beautifully summarized the key takeaways. Holly, thank you for writing up social posts for both our Workhuman channels and for our speaker - excited to build this into the process for speakers moving forward. Jess, thanks for your help getting everything into Elevate for easy sharing. And Max, thank you for attending on the day to live tweet the session. I know I can always count on all of you and I'm grateful for your collaboration.\n\n115#Last minute request support|Thanks for pitching in on a VERY last minute request for the HR Pulse magazine fall issue!\n\n116#Making Work Human|The journey to publishing a book is a long one. So much work behind the scenes to ensure it's top notch, well-written, and a fantastic testament to the thought leadership and vision of the authors and company. Now imagine being at the finish line and a pandemic hits.    Imagine pushing the book back given the uncertainty in the world. Now imagine in the midst of all this, the book becoming better with an opportunity to update it to reflect the new realities and the social injustices in the world.  Thank you Dan for all the work to bring it across the finish line (a second time!). This is a book that brings the thought leadership and writings of Eric, Derek, and Workhuman to new levels!\n\n117#Mining networks for Keeping Work Human guests!|We launched the Keeping Work Human video series back in March as a way to lead through COVID-19, and then we started a conversation about racial inequity, and now we're looking forward to what's next. For the last 3-4 months we've recorded video interviews with 1-5 guests a week from across not only the HR leadership space, but from our own lives. All of you have contributed to this effort by working your networks, asking the customers and future customers you talk to, helping me reschedule guests when a conflict arises (huge hat tip to Daisy and Lauren!), convincing your friends and family members to come on, and simply keeping the video series in mind as you go about your daily lives. I couldn't keep this thing going day in and day out without the steady stream of guest suggestions, scheduling help, and introductory emails. Thank you for connecting us with the 40+ guests we've had the pleasure of speaking with and getting to know over the course of this show (and helping me with the logistics, too). It's been a massive team effort and I'm glad to have the chance to finally recognize this group!\n\n118#Leading with Humanity|Dan - I just want to express my gratitude for your human-centered approach to leadership always, but especially these past few months. You've led our team through truly unprecedented times. You've been clear about expectations and consistent in your communication. You're always understanding of the various work/life balance challenges the pandemic has presented. And you continue to focus on removing barriers and helping us do our best work. It will be great to finally meet in person at some point, but I've enjoyed our weekly walking 1/1s and your steady and calm advice for navigating our team through the many pivots in strategy. Thank you for leading with humanity!\n\n119#What Makes Us Human: Heart and Soul|Team, when most of us are feeling defeated, deflated, and hopeless, each of you came together to unite our hearts and souls with the people we most want to reach. I shed more than one tear experiencing the imagery and messages of hope and pragmatism. Your respect, empathy, and compassion for all hearts and souls inside and outside of our company has made an impact.  Thank you for transforming a sad exception to our lives into one that brings us together instead of dividing us all.  As always, thank you for your hard work and determination to Workhuman. Best, Patti\n\n120#Amazing Content|Amazing content team. I was doing a bit of work this afternoon, working on some messaging and themes for the Chris French email. One of the things I needed to do was gather up content on the topic of next normal as we all adjust to different ways of working. As I searched our incredible resource center, it got me thinking what an AMAZING content team we have. I found everything I needed with ease and it reminded me of just how impressive of a feat this team accomplished in such short time to crank our relevant and useful content to our key audiences. Cheers to this amazing group!\n\n121#Inspiring leadership|Dan – Every workday since at least mid-April, you have sent an email to your team (Sarah, Aaron, Lynne, and me) simply titled \"Inspiration.\" These messages contain short passages intended to ignite gratitude, energy, courage, hope, or another empowering, positive emotion. Some days, the mornings are too busy to fully read and internalize the message – but I make sure to look at it before I log off and it helps remind me of why I'm working so hard, in collaboration with all these fantastic people, to get Workhuman's messages and solutions out into market where they can help people and organizations all over the world. Thank you for everything you do to keep us feeling not only motivated and energized, but also appreciated, heard, and supported. You're a real champion and I'm grateful for your leadership.\n\n122#Social Media Livestream power players!|Thank you to this group of social media power users! You each contributed 5+ posts during the week of Workhuman Livestream, contributing to a company record of over 500 employee posts in a single day. Well done!\n\n123#Fierce commitment to urgency|\"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there IS such a thing as being too late. This is not time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.\" - MLK JR.   Team, since I started just over a month ago, I have heard from many of you and our stakeholders who have talked about the misfortune of joining Workhuman during a global pandemic that has changed every thing about how we live: from how we interact, to what we spend our time and money on, what we value, and how we work.  The truth is, there was no better time for me to be able to witness the magic that is Workhuman. We already know what is important and that is human connection. What you have demonstrated is humanity during a time of extreme urgency - a rarity in life and certainly in business. Thank you for your passion for your and your commitment to each other and our stakeholders.  I am honored to work alongside each of you.\n\n124#Moodtracker Launch success!|Team – Thank you for delivering our brand new Moodtracker product. Thank you so much to everybody for the amazing work on the Moodtracker product. Hard to believe this was just an idea at the beginning of January. Since then a team has formed, the product designed, architected, built, tested, branded, communicated, marketed and launched. Whew. The speed at which the groups collaborated is a tribute to the sense of camaraderie and positivity we have at Workhuman. The energy, imagination has shone through in every way. This coupled with the determination to deliver a world-class product means that today we have a sixth edition to our Workhuman Cloud suite. Welcome Moodtracker. On behalf of all of the humans in the company, thank you. Eric.\n\n125#Moodtracker GTM Content Excellence|Dan and Jess – I love getting the chance to work with my old Content neighbors, especially on the big stage of a new product launch (combined with a major online event!). Dan, you’re a pro at finding the right tone and messaging for the live blog, and yesterday you were a natural partner in the Moodtracker go to market strategy. Jess, you truly drove the success of the infographic, not only providing the copy but working with Kevin to get the visuals looking great. Not only that, you both made sure you were available for proof reading and content review on all Moodtracker and post event materials (as well as customer logo advice!) I know this week is only the beginning, and I can’t wait to collaborate more with you both very soon!\n\n126#Spotlight Speaker Success Stories|Team - thank you for stepping into the spotlight during our last three marketing town halls. You’ve shown at an exemplary level of innovation, determination, and grit amidst our new normal. You’ve conveyed your success stories (Merck webinar, Keeping work human series, and WHL) with an awesome combination of humility and accessibility. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being leaders of the moment and in the moment. The best practices you’ve shared and modeled to achieve such high levels of success are great guideposts and shining examples of a high performing culture ! Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n127#Meaningful Words|Dan and Sarah, thank you for always being there to put word to the things we need to say.  So many of our efforts stem from an idea.  A concept.  A bundle of thoughts – which can be interpreted may ways and have different meanings for our many audiences.  You once again stepped up to tackle a challenge we faced with putting meaningful words and clear objectives to a project, that is helping all the teams take action in the market.  Thank you for your help and support.\n\n128#Yahoo for Customer Content!|Dan, Sarah and Jess - thanks so much for the partnership over the last few weeks to help crank out some great customer content. You have been so helpful, responsive and thinking outside of the box to help brainstorm ways to get some rich and thoughtful bits in front of our customers in a time when they need it most. All of this when I know you have the fullest of full plates on lots of other important content! Thanks for being such a great partners and collaborators!\n\n129#Making us stronger together - every single day|Team - what a week! I am blown away by your collective and individual innovation. These are the experiences that can give us the best learnings and insights - not only in terms of skills, but more important, learning just how much awesomeness we are capable of bringing to the world. Thank you. Onward!\n\n130#Checking In, Checking Success!|Amy, Dan, and Katie - Every morning at 9 since we've been at home due to COVID-19, we've checked in together with our video calls.  You've shared not only amazing ideas and suggestions but also worries and concerns as we navigate so many interesting paths as a company, culture, and team. Thank you for your willingness to be so open, as it's a critical ingredient for trust and ultimate success.  And boy, has there been success!  Incredible achievements across PR, content, and social.  Anyone looking at our social feeds can see your work and leadership on a daily basis and see how it's propelling our brand and company higher and higher. Thank you for all of your work (and teamwork) as we continue to show how Workhuman can help elevate human connections across the world!  Kevin\n\n131#One Team|Dan and Jess, I can’t thank you enough for all the proofing you’ve done over the past week as we prepared for the launch of free products. There has been a LOT of copy created with all kinds of quick turnarounds - and since it’s never ideal for writers to proofread their own work, I knew I could come to you. Jess - you’ve had your keen eyes on all the social posts for the Keeping Work Human series and all the social ads for the launch of free WHCT. Dan - you reviewed the entire microsite copy this morning in record time and when I thanked you for doing so, you said “We’re one team.” We sure are. I appreciate you both so very much.\n\n132#Helping Excellence Become A Reality|Along with Rosette and the team (Omar, Naomi, Amanda and Krista) we would like to thank this amazing group of colleagues who joined us with little notice to be the Alpha Testers  of a new workshop we have created for prospects and maybe even customers –  Keeping Work Human.  Like the judges on America’s Got Talent, you silently sat then gave your direct, candid review verbally (and then used Conversations to deliver the feedback in writing).   You shared your collective wisdom, gave us thoughts on how to improve and then hit the gold button - so next stop is to take the show on the road.  Off to TX we (virtually) go to deliver this to USAA and there is a potential of General Mills in Minnesota next and maybe even Memorial Hermann Health System  Rosette and all of us that worked many hours on this workshop  appreciate you all so much for jumping with little notice and helping us all prepare to deliver excellence.\n\n133#Making COVID Connections for Merck|While we're still in the process of creating a webinar for Merck, I had to pause and appreciate the amount of effort that has gone into creating an exceptional experience and one that ties into the current pandemic situation. In the span of the week, we've pivoted and changed the focus of the webinar altogether to be timely, considerate and ties into concerns of the greater HR community, while also being in line with the vision that our contacts at Merck have. That includes multiple revisions of content, shepherding and managing approvals of interested parties. Not to mention creating a final piece that will speak to the strong partnership we have with Merck, as well as the human messaging we want to have in the market. Despite the constant changes, I walk away from of all of our brainstorming sessions feeling energized and excited at the story we are weaving, supplemented by WARI data. Thank you all for the talent, commitment and passion you have brought and continue bringing to this effort.\n\n134#Sharing is caring|High 5s to you 5 fine humans! Why you ask? I pulled together a marketplace update over the weekend but with more than a dozen companies to track, I knew I could not do it alone. I asked the marketing leaders who could help out and Dan and John - you both didn't blink raising your hand to chip in. Dan - your team is cranking out thoughtful content every day but you generously offered to let Jess H help with this. John - first you said you could ask your team to help but then you decided to take on the extra workload yourself! Jess - you were quick, thorough and proactively reached out to me with your specific updates throughout the week. But, as the week went on and our COVID related scope of work kept growing, I knew I had to reassess how we resourced the efforts so that we could provide timely updates to Sales and the entire organization. Pam - I went to you next and asked if I could enlist Mark's help. And you too, didn't hesitate a second. You quickly talked to Mark and followed up to tell me he'd be in touch. Within hours, Mark not only proactively reached out to me for the download but he took the project on with ease and enthusiasm and delivered a new update of today's marketplace COVID related activity Hugely valuable. Thank you all! I love this team and this great example of teamwork at its finest.\n\n135#Leaning on the Experts|Guys, I really appreciate your support over the last few days as we worked through the details of the video series. Thank you for sharing your input on how this should work, look, and be delivered to the audience. We’re moving so fast and making decisions quickly, and doing that well is only possible when we trust the team around us. I’m extremely grateful to each of you for sharing your expertise!\n\n136#Calm support through trying times|Hi team – I want to commend you for rallying together across content and social to streamline processes, align on calendars, and communicate with calmness and clarity across teams. Dan, Sarah, and Lauren – no one works in a vacuum, and I don't thank you enough for your editorial support, not just now but always. I appreciate the opportunities you've provided to be brave in my writing and confident in my editing and leadership. Max – I was looped in late to the current #RecognizetheGood campaign and you fielded my questions about how to translate it to Elevate, checked my work, and even hopped on a last-minute call to talk through it. Holly and Roshni – you're both so busy, but you've been there to fearlessly offer guidance and support and help make everything as efficient as possible as we all figure out our way through this. Thank you all for your part in making this week (how is it only Tuesday?!) much easier than it could have been. You're the best.\n\n137#Dan the Man!|Dan - special call out to recognize the outsized contribution you’ve made to the COVID campaign. The editorial calendar you created and over-delivered on today is the lynchpin of this initiative. Thank you for showcasing agility and commitment to the business at a time when we are all being pulled in lots of directions - with gratitude -C\n\n138#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n139#Words of Wisdom|Every day, we have to make decisions in our jobs and life.  Not just about what to do – but how to react.  And no matter our role, title or years of experience – questioning yourself in the moment is normal.  But it never feels good.  Dan, you recently observed me doing just that.  Juggling some decisions and actions, while debating and questioning every one of them in the process.  You took a moment to quietly approach me and offer a few words of wisdom and encouragement.  You related some of your own experiences and helped me have the confidence to forge forward on my path.  Thank you for taking that brief moment out of your day for me (and really – it was all of two minutes we chatted).  It meant a lot to me, and was truly impactful.\n\n140#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n141#Helped me find my voice, quite literally!|Publishing my first article in Forbes was big moment for me and ironically, all the things I shared quite literally were a part of how this came together. Amy, thanks for the steady push to share my voice. You have been a staunch supporter guiding with a firm yet gentle hand. Lynne, you got the ball rolling, talking with me, helping make sense out of my myriad thoughts and seeing a story, putting them in writing in a great cohesive way. Dan, you steadily provided guidance and resources. Dave, you leaned in immediately when you heard my frustration, rolled up your sleeves and channeled my voice through rounds 4, 5 and 6. Sarah, you are just magical with your editing style. You took version 6 and over the weekend edited for crispness and polished in a way that made me feel eloquent and clever. I am grateful for this agile team that came together to ironically help me find my voice in print! Thank you all for helping me take my own darn advice: taking that first step. Here's to many more!\n\n142#Spare a moment for a proof?|Dan, Sarah - I've been using these short words often lately and I want to take a moment to say thank you for all your support. While the phrase is sort, the requests are not! From reviewing press releases, to Forbes blog posts to byline articles, the timeliness and rigor you put into reviewing the content is much appreciated!\n\n143#Constructs for success|A few weeks ago we took on a herculean task, gathering a small cross-functional team to create a rubric for consistent messaging heading into 2020. 19 core narratives, from themes to products, and the building began. Each of you played a part, both large and small and we are off to a such a strong start! Next steps are culling these down even more to get them over the finish line but I couldn’t have done any of this without your help and support. GO TEAM!\n\n144#Interview dream team|A sincere THANK YOU to all of you for your participation in interviews over the past few months, for our Director of Product Marketing. Someone of you met with 5 candidates - which adds up to a LOT of time out of your schedules. Some of you only met with a couple of finalist candidates, but helped us to wrap up the search and make important decisions about who we were hiring. Overall, you all were so responsive, flexible, open-minded and just a pleasure to work with throughout this process. Thank you so much for the part you played in getting this fill across the finish line!\n\n145#Copy + Content = Collaboration|Dan and Jess, I just want to thank you both for being such great partners around the editorial and copy guidelines, and how we stay aligned and consistent in what we produce -- especially since I've crossed over to Creative. I value our collaboration so much and I continue to admire your collective level of commitment to quality and consistency. And you know you're both my favorite people to nerd out with over some grammar rules. Long live the Oxford comma!\n\n146#Making Making Work Human|Dan - I want to commend all of your fantastic work on the Making Work Human book. The journey to book completion is a long one. So many drafts, reviews, inputs, approvals, and more. Through it all, you have been so steady, focused, and dedicated to quality. You have reviewed the book so many times I'm sure you can recite it word for word! Your meticulous approach to detail is the perfect attribute toward ensuring what goes into market represents the best of Workhuman and Eric and Derek. Thank you for all of your efforts thus far. The end is near (though it many ways, the opportunities are just beginning!)  Kevin\n\n147#Amazing team support|I wanted to take a moment to say a big Thank You. You guys have been an amazing support for me since I started in Jan. Always so happy to jump in, point me in the right direction and producing amazing content. Really happy to be working with you guys!\n\n148#Feedback|Dan - Thank you for taking time to send me feedback. It was also very timely! I know these requests can be time consuming but they are very helpful! I am grateful for our partnership and relationship.\n\n149#Ask and you shall receive|Twice, I've recently come to you with simple enough asks regarding our new book. Twice, you immediately responded during your own busy day, providing me with the exact thing I was looking for - no questions asked. Thank you, Dan, for being a great teammate and sharing information that you know is critically beneficial to our team!\n\n150#Always On Communication|Dan, I feel like this is quite overdue. I want to commend you on ALWAYS putting communication first. No matter how much you have going on, no matter how many meetings, deadlines or initiatives; you still miraculously find the time to walk over and spend time just sharing updates and ensuring we are all aligned; critical when we are moving so swiftly. Thank you for always being a top notch listener and an all around star of a teammate - GO DAN!\n\n151#Helping to build a culture of \"I see you\"|Team #15!! Thank you for your active  participation in our Ignite Solutions brainstorm session. I really appreciate that you all contributed, you built off each other's ideas, you purposefully included the facilitator as a contributor (thank you Stacey) and most of all you came up with some really great ideas on how we can keep our culture feeling \"small\" as we continue to grow, how we can better connect with our colleagues, and create moments that matter. Your efforts made the session successful and made my job as the facilitator super easy. I look forward to our ideas coming to life. You all proved the power of the Workhuman culture/zeitgeist!\n\n152#Focus on Improvement and Growth|Dan - I wanted to commend your work over the past couple of months on bringing Seismic to our attention. Great job in taking a step back and thinking about software solutions that could elevate our ability to help sales (and create more consistency for content). Your approach was thoughtful, thorough, and smart. While we have not crossed the finish line yet, I did want to call out your great leadership from the very beginning.  Well done!\n\n153#Super helpful messaging framework|Dan -  thank you for putting together a comprehensive messaging framework for Eric and Derek's new book. As we start to seed the market with key themes from the book, I've found it a helpful reference in creating new content and editing content to ensure messaging alignment. I really like the way you organized the document, with key messages about what readers will get out of the book at the beginning and quick recaps of each chapter. I know I'm not the only one who will benefit from your work here. And as a side note, thank you for also for keeping me and others consistently updated on progress of the book so we're all on the same page. Great job!\n\n154#WH News - last story of the year!|Dan — I wanted to take a moment to thank you for  letting us cover your experience dancing in The Nutcracker in last week’s WH news feature story. Your understanding that these different life experiences and accomplishments are some of our most engaging pieces of content is really appreciated. You were such a pleasure to interview! Your answers were so thoughtful, descriptive, and your ties back into how this life experience outside of work has a direct correlation to your work at Workhuman were spot on. You agreed to this interview the week of, and set-up a meeting the very next day. Not only did you provide us with such great content, you also took the time to read through and make some edits for us. I appreciate you!\n\n155#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n156#Thank you!|I want to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me to discuss your role.  You have such an extensive background and it was so interesting to listen to all you've done in your career.  And who would've known you live the next town over from me.  Good Luck with your acting debut!\n\n157#Accelerating into 2020|What a year of surprises! Thanks to each of you for bringing your insights, ideas, and energy to bear on our top 5 accounts. We've been meeting quarterly to review from every angle how we can from every perspective, impact the business. So many great ideas were uncovered and put into action immediately from these conversations. And each of us, learned something big about how with some focus, we could more directly impact big opportunities as an organization. Thank you for early and late meetings, for staying focused, and for caring so much about excellence! This has been an incredible 'test' of the WH network! Bravo!\n\n158#A True Global Content Team for Executive Forums|I wanted to commend all of you for your teamwork and diligence chronicling the key insights and learnings from the executive forums in the fall.  These insights are an important element for our ability to continue our thought leadership and communication touch-points with this high level audience. It will also help us internally - to ensure we - as a collective team - are out in front of emerging HR and people trends. Special shout-out to Sarah for the writing of the whitepaper (the final version which is coming soon!) and Dan for his foresight and strategy behind the people coverage of the forums, ensuring each one had a content lead to roll-up into the whitepaper output.\n\n159#Thanks to the data nerds|Thank you to everyone on this award for taking time to review questions and provide input for the upcoming full-time U.S. employee survey. What started out as a \"mini\" survey outside of the annual international survey has turned into quite a robust assessment of the employee experience in the U.S. We're tackling some sensitive issues such as harassment and discrimination and I really appreciate the thought each of you put into additional questions and answer options and getting the wording just right. I'm looking forward to seeing the results come in and using this data to build a compelling report that will drive leads and media inquires.\n\n160#Team creativity|Thank you for your help collecting and sharing insightful, relevant information for our Q4 customer acceleration meetings.  With your contributions, we were able to identify marketing opportunities and generate new ideas for delivering value to these important accounts.  Looking forward to continued collaboration and the wealth of innovative ideas that will result!\n\n161#The Details Matter|As we continue to modernize and leverage Social Selling in all facets of our business, new requirements and needs present themselves. With several new associates joining the organization it became clear that we needed some great new backgrounds and imagery that would align them with WH, our culture, and our branding. Dan I reached out to understand where I should go with my ask, and without hesitation you jumped in, reached out to Carrie, and got the project under way. Carrie, without skipping a beat, you rolled up your sleeves and created some beautiful graphics and images that align our people to WH and to our culture. I was blown away at your urgency and your pace. Thank you so much for making this a priority and executing flawlessly. I am grateful.\n\n162#New Thought Leadership, booked!|Dan and Kevin, today is an important day as we submit our latest thinking and thought leadership in the form of a draft new book to Mc Graw Hill!  Wow!  A world class publisher will today accept the work and experience of the collective Workhuman team and all our collective work and excellence.  It’s thank to you both for your project leadership, eagle eye editing and constant stewardship of this that we are here at this point today.  Thank you both sincerely from me and Eric, this a tremendous achievement that will within months provide great dividends. Well done!\n\n163#Content Suggestions|Sarah and Dan, I want to thank you for the sense of urgency in which you're both working to help the field sales team deliver impactful content to our prospective buyers.  I came to you a few weeks back with 2 suggestions - a cost of doing nothing piece and one around the potential need for organizations to report on their human capital investments.  Within a few hours you were mobilizing a way to make it happen.  We've created 1 piece and based on the conversation it started it is now being strategized as part of a larger campaign.  Thank you for always being willing to listen to my ideas (as half-baked as they normally are) and for working with a sense of urgency we need to reach our audience in a timely fashion!\n\n164#Capturing the Citizens Story|Dan, Thank you for your leadership and support around capturing the Citizens story. You are the #1 supporter of our customer stories - always reminding us that this validation content is gold. I appreciate you being there throughout the process - checking in, reviewing content (quotes within and outside of the final asset), and offering your help along the way. Thank you and I look forward to working with you on more of these opportunities in the future.\n\n165#Bringing the Humanity at HR Tech|Dan, Amy, Mike, and Max - Wonderful work at the HR Tech conference in Las Vegas. Shows like this are an incredible opportunity to influence the market - through key influencers, analysts, customers, and more.  There are countless items that play into the strategy - from social presence to meetings to sessions to dinners to drinks to content. It's a constant flurry of activities that show who we are as a company and people. Thank you for the passion you brought, the eagerness to learn and make new connections, and all the great relationship building along the way!\n\n166#Marketing Team Alignment|Dan, you are in inspiration for this newbie! You were proactive in gathering marketing director team input and helping to smooth over a challenging time of organizational change. The format was appropriate and the organization was on point.\n\n167#It's Planning Time!|Team! I wanted to send a huge thank you for the time and energy put into Q4 planning. Collaborating with this fine group of humans is always a pleasure. We have continued to refine the process, bring in more folks and I think each time we do this, we have a better end result! Kicking this off will be exciting and I think come 2020, we will evolve our thinking even more. Well done all!\n\n168#Start Spreading the Executive News|Thank you for all of your hard work in writing, designing, developing, and launching our first Executive Forum Newsletter. This addition of content to the Executive Program covered the theme of trust and this team is one I trust in - to get the project done and done well! From dotting i's and crossing t's in the content, to a branded design for this audience; from the development of new blog post links to cross referencing recipient lists in Salesforce; to reporting on the send via Marketo with a phenomenal open and click through rate - your efforts helped us achieve and measure success for what will continue to be a key communication initiative for the executive audience.\n\n169#Now that, is Acceleration!|Kristen and Dan, wanted to thank you both one, for letting me into the Acceleration account meeting party and two for being such amazing champions for the customer! You both took the time to dig into each account using all sorts of tools. You also took that information and synthesised it not into just a readout, but lots of good insight with some actionable next steps that can be taken now, but also to set us up for a bright future with our key customers. The hard work and preparation showed in the last 2 weeks of meetings. Well done and excited to see this all put into action!\n\n170#Q3 Acceleration|Thanks to this team for another outstanding Acceleration Project quarterly mind meld. Every quarter we come together representing the expertise and perspective of many areas of the business. This quarter was special as we've 'accelerated' our thinking and really got the team thinking bigger and making connections and recommendations. This commitment and intense work for our top 5 customers is paying off as we have come away with a laundry list of opportunities and ideas to grow and protect the business. Thank you for your teamwork, intense listening skills, and outstanding impactful insights!!!\n\n171#Steady Leadership|Dan - I am grateful for your continued leadership over the past few months. There have been countless examples of you of stepping up for time sensitive projects, helping guide team members during times of change, or you simply just asking the right questions on how you can help keep us on track.  You do all of this with a ton of projects on your plate. As we embark on our next phase of growth, it's reassuring to have you on the team. Your steadiness does not go unnoticed and is appreciated by so many members of the marketing team – and outside marketing as well.  Thank you for your consistent dedication and focus to helping the company succeed.\n\n172#It Takes a Village...|Thank you all so much for your time and energy reviewing speaker applications for Workhuman Live 2020. We received hundreds of submissions and recommendations that needed to be properly vetted in a short period of time. You provided important background information on a lot of these applicants and evaluated each one based on our top criteria. The goal for next year’s speaker line-up is to present the world’s top business thinkers who are truly shaping the future of the workplace landscape. It’s a tricky balance to ensure we have renowned thought-leaders in the space while also bringing to light a few hidden gems that our audience can learn from. Each of you brought your experience, expertise, and unique perspectives to our group discussion on Monday. I love being around teammates who are just as excited as I am about this whole process. We’re just getting started but your insights have put us on the right path. Thanks all!\n\n173#Content is King, really, it is!|Dan and Sarah - what can I say, you are both amazing partners, but specifically in Q3, you have been lifesavers. Being short handed in demand, Sarah you have stepped in to provide some much needed to support to track content from creation to completion. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate that support. Dan, you are always willing to listen, checking in to see if we need anything at all. I have lost track how many times you have asked 'how can I help?'  I am so thankful for the continued partnership and teamwork. Cannot wait to see what Q4 brings!\n\n174#Commitment to Quality|Dan, thank you so much for your supportive leadership over many weeks as we’ve worked to get multiple video projects across the finish line. I appreciate your interest in these projects, your consistent commitment to quality, and your willingness to work together to move roadblocks along the way. Thanks for always asking, “what can I do to help?” Even if things feel out of our hands, it’s nice to know I have your support and I am always confident we will turn around a quality product in time. Thank you.\n\n175#Taking it to the next level|Team- Thank you so much for meeting with me yesterday to discuss taking Jesse’s book to the next level and brainstorming all things analytics with me. Sales will be ecstatic to have this campaign and I’m looking forward to the results pouring in!!\n\n176#Relationship building and more at SHRM 19|Great job at SHRM Annual Conference this week!  This conference is a great relationship building opportunity – for us to continue to leverage the relationships we have and make new ones.  All with the intent of creating new business and thought leadership opportunities.  Mike – excellent work with the SHRM Foundation.  This year’s format was different than past years – but it remained a great way to connect with industry leaders and show Workhuman as a brand that cares. And the dinner with Cy Wakeman was amazing fun!  Dan – great job in leveraging the show to get competitive intel, industry information to help our content strategy and new ideas to help our future messaging. Amy – this was your first SHRM conference but you jumped right in!  You spent time at the booth, got some great media interviews and made new connections for Workhuman. Can't wait to see what comes of all of them. Well done all!\n\n177#What a Brainstorm|There’s nothing like a three-hour meeting, sandwiched between the company meeting, a marketing vp meeting, and countless other commitments.  Yet, every one of you came with your A-Game – ready to brainstorm a whole new approach to the Workhuman Live website experience.  Thank you all for showing up focused, open-minded, and collectively in alignment on exceeding our audiences’ expectations through the site.  Reimagining a website is never easy, especially when trying to set aside what we already know to try new things.  Every one of you stepped up to share your areas of expertise and add value into the overall plan.  Your input was so valuable and is helping to frame out an exceptional site plan for 2020.\n\n178#Dan the Man!|Great way to start the morning, Dan! Today you brought key stakeholders together to discuss what makes healthcare tick...not just healthcare but what seems to be looking like pharma, bio pharma, assisted living etc lol. Thank you for taking the time to schedule time on all of our busy calendars and recruit not 1 or 2 but 5 different business units to discuss all aspects of the industry. I left feeling like I wanted more, but still was able to get my regular job done;) Scratching the surface is what you called it...either way it was a great way to open up communication this am. Thanks again!!\n\n179#Because you care|Dan- I cant thank you enough for your continued efforts to learn the most efficient ways to use Workfront. You saw Dianne’s message about keeping tasks up to date so we can accurately report back to VP’s and immediately reached out to Traffic to check in and make sure you were doing your part. You’re not only paying attention, but you care and that means the world to us. Thank you! (I hope you’re also enjoying the new dashboard!)\n\n180#Let's talk data!|Thank you all for participating in this morning's data think tank (especially on a Friday before the long weekend!). This was an important first step in working collaboratively to unlock the power of the data each of us collect with our teams across Marketing. I was truly inspired by all of your ideas and perspectives, and there is so much potential for us to use these analytics to take the right actions to bring everything we do for Workhuman to the next level!\n\n181#Thank you for the support|These days we are so busy.  Our time is so valuable.  You spent 30 minutes with this new guy.  Listening to questions you probably heard 100 times over and answered with grace and clarity.  Thank you for teaching me how valuable teamwork is here at Workhuman and making this a welcoming environment.   I know from past experiences this is not the norm!  Thank you and I can't wait to take up more of your time in the future.\n\n182#Program Content Masters!|Team, thanks so much for taking a big chunk out of a very busy week to discuss content for demand programs in Q3. I loved the collaborative nature of the meeting. It was so productive; fueling our creative juices from the offsite gave us even more steam! I am psyched about the outcome and thrilled  we continue to elevate our partnership to get awesome content in front of our key decision makers! Laura, thank you for keeping on top of program timing and initiating this conversation to keep us all ahead o the calendar. Dan and Sarah, thanks for bringing your A-game, being so open-minded and having the goals top of mind. Go team!!!!\n\n183#Sometimes little things are big things :)|Hey Dan, I wanted to call you out for taking the time to scribe all the notes from our Marketing Leadership meeting last week. I've been out sick all week, and reviewing my notes etc - and was so happy to see how you've collected it all. I know its a little thing, but was super valuable to have it done and communicated. Thanks!\n\n184#Rebranded + new collateral to share with the world|Team - Since the start of the rebrand and even up until now, it’s been impressive to see how many content pieces you have played a part in updating, creating, and versioning! Between the rebrand for collateral and core campaigns the rough math in my head comes out to about 60 pieces!! You have each contributed so much time and effort to keep these on time and on brand. Thank you for all of your hard work! Sales is now well equipped to share Workhuman collateral with the world. Look out world!\n\n185#Making Time to Brainstorm|Dan, Lauren, Jen, and Geoff, thanks so much for your time during our call for speakers brainstorming session. It's helpful to hear new and exciting ideas on how we can update the call for speakers webpage. The design layout plays a huge role in how an applicant  absorbs who we are and what we're looking for. The text on the page needs to match the voice and tone of Workhuman while still being practical and instructional. We're on our way to creating a new template that serves all of these needs. I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out!\n\n186#Supportive Leadership|This is an overdue thank you for your supportive leadership, especially as it relates to all of the work we all do around capturing customer stories. This is a sweet spot that I know you're super passionate about - and I can see that in the support you've provided me time and again around this work. Thanks for always reminding me of the value that this validation content provides. It's not always a quick turnaround on this kind of content. It takes careful planning, a lot of collaboration and it's easy to get bogged down in process and approvals, but the impact is worth the effort. I'm grateful to have you in my corner as we continue to evolve this work. Thank you!\n\n187#I see you...|Often, we look for singular moments or projects as a reason to share gratitude. But recently, I heard someone talk about how powerful it is to reach out to colleagues every now and again, to say: \"I see you.\" Especially when the pressures of our normal work are accumulating. I immediately thought of you. The past few months have been a huge challenge for the rebrand and the Workhuman event. Whether its adjusting the text on collateral pieces, helping rewrite bullet points on posters and event spaces, churning out headlines, emails, landing pages, white papers, working to keep the sales team informed of whats available (oh, and helping write a book?)... and I'm sure plenty more things that I'm not privy to. I just want you to know that I see you, and all your hard work and effort. You're a great partner.\n\n188#We will no longer be Dublin's best kept secret!|From Maureen and I squeezing an hour to brainstorm as quick as we could at Workhuman live, to the million emails requesting a change here and there, I cannot stress how proud I am with the finished product. As I was setting up tonight at Dublin Tech Summit, OUR STAND was the one companies like Apple were taking a picture of for ideas for future events!! Thank you all for your hard work, creativity and patience.  I truly believe after DTS, we will no longer be Dublin's best kept secret, but well on our way to being a sought after employer in the Dublin market.\n\n189#Wharton Wonder Team|I am grateful to you for your help at Workhuman with the Wharton research project. Doing a live research project was a first for the company - an opportunity that came about because of Workhuman itself. For us to continue to change the workplace and the work, we need to try new things and stretch ourselves. Each of you did a great job setting up to help at the event with the live study. Special kudos to Jesse and Greg for their involvement and expertise from the start and Lauren who managed all of it with the lead researcher - not an easy task with so many elements happening during the same timeframe.  Look forward to what the results will bring!\n\n190#Persona Workshop Warriors Unite!|I have such a grateful heart for this day, this entire team of Marketing mavens, and all the opportunities that sit within our reach. I have never felt more connected to our team than I do at this very moment. We just completed an all hands, all day persona workshop! Woohoo!!! Thank you for your investment. Thank you for being a kind audience that stayed engaged. Thank you for asking thoughtful questions. Thank you for your humor and your patience. Thank you for being real. Thank you for embracing the 7 1/2 hour marathon persona training session we shared today with gusto and heart! I truly believe that we will be a better team, and we will produce better marketing because of the time we spent together today. I can’t wait to hear your feedback about the agenda, the learning modules, the wiki….ALL the things! I can’t wait to apply this first body of persona work to our marketing efforts. Let’s GOOOOOOO!\n\n191#Gratitudes for our breakout group leaders|Thank you for stepping up to lead the practice area breakout groups today. It was a packed agenda that I tried to choreograph down to the last minute and last detail. I felt completely at ease with the five practice area team presentations because I knew I had awesome leaders guiding the way. The teams were cross functional spanning all areas of our department including some new faces from our PR firm, but in watching everyone interact with each other, you would have thought we worked really closely together for decades. So much collaboration and lively discussion. Insightful presentations....It was a beautiful thing. Thanks again for your leadership.\n\n192#Utilizing Ambassadors to the fullest!|A huge thanks to each one of you for being amazing partners in really pushing our Ambassador strategy forward this year. This team is so supportive, responsive, positive and it feels like anything is possible when I work with you. Together we were able to carve out a new strategic plan to utilize all 35 of our Ambassadors and across a wide variety of activities (case studies, testimonials, videos, radio, blogs and more!). While we are still working to total up the outcomes, I know that what each of you owned and executed will be crucial to our future success. We are locked and loaded with brand new material, voices, opinions that will super charge our \"WorkHuman Voice\" to so many others. If Ambassadors did not participate this year, they are eager to be a part of even more throughout the year. I heard such nice feedback from this group about how kind, smart and fun our people are and that they loved being a part of these areas. Thank you for all of your hard work and for truly putting customers first. You are a part of what makes these folks ambassadors for life. :)\n\n193#GF -> WH|I am so grateful for all you did to launch the rebranded website. It took a long way to get there but wow, we all did it! The end result is clean, bright and engaging and one URL!! The words are crisp and the IA is looking great. There were so many parts and pieces that it would be like an Emmy speech (cue the bassoons dragging me off stage!) thanking each and every one of you but I am sure you all know how much you contributed to the success. A few highlights: Angela, being the mad trafficker she is, Matt D, behind the scenes supporting and guiding, Maggie, Lauren and Dan's killer copy skills, rocking the new messaging! Geoff, the midnight coder, always pushing to try to break the chains that are Connelly! Jay and Ty, your collaborative designs and dividing and conquering with a smile, and onsite Nashville, Anthony and Brian coding some last minute styles so pages looked great! Lastly, Brian's first big launch as a leader on the team and what a great job! Here's to many more.\n\n194#Mega/Super Session Flip|Thank you all so much for stepping up and taking some shifts for the Mega/Super Session flips! We needed these last min and you all took some time out of your days and responsibilities to help usher in the General Session room!!! Thank you so much for lending a hand and helping out!!\n\n195#Comms & Content Mastery at Workhuman Live|Wow. This team rocked Workhuman Live. It is truly an immersive adventure - with hard work and focus leading to \"our water\" - an incredible experience that will empower and enrich our leaders. On the content side, Dan - incredible leadership. You support and lift your team when they need it most - and spearhead so many other initiatives, particularly the post-show content strategy. Lauren C - words cannot fully describe your enormous impact on the event in managing our speakers and tracks. So many details - you get it done with poise, class, and determination. Sarah - your efforts leading our blog strategy has resulted in another step up for our on-site thought leadership. The bar has risen again! Lauren B - your creative approach continually up-levels the words that our attendees see throughout. And at the event, you were a huge part of the blogging efforts. Aaron and Lynne - fantastic job blogging at the conference, finding the right insights to help our attendees take back key learnings to help their organizations grow. Jess - while you were not able to join us at the event, you were invaluable leading up supporting so many writing needs (and your editing skills rock too!). For internal comms, Colleen - fantastic work leading our strategy this year, helping our company \"feel\" the event better than ever. Kristen - your creativity & determination brought it to life internally, plus your support on social was huge! Clare - loved your timely updates and great ideas. Your idea to ask Kat for an internal video was genius! For external comms, Mike - masterful job with our influencer community once again. Their engagement was incredible! 20 interviews including some of our keynotes with Workhuman Radio (your baby). Just amazing! And Amy, while you couldn't be there, your impact on our PR coverage was huge with some fantastic pieces and more to come. Thank you to the best comms and content team the event world has ever seen. Grateful for all of you.\n\n196#Driving Miss Crazy.|Dan, I want to thank you for being the consummate gentleman and offering me and my “logistical anxiety” a ride to and from the airport for the second Workhuman year in a row (even after last year I played that April Fool’s joke on you). I don’t know what other manager I’ll ever have who’ll show up to my house with the soundtrack to Les Miserables already playing for his former theater geek of an employee - probably none because you’re one of a kind and I really appreciate your generosity. And sorry I pranked you again (and you fell for it again). Next year, I’ll drive!\n\n197#More web game than Spiderman|Team it has been an exciting past few months working though the changes, enhancements and additions to the Workhuman corporate website. Innovation, Imagination and Determination sum up the weekly sprints, days and nights of hard work that went into making it happen. Tyler, Jay and Jess your designs are full of life and energy. Between the rebrand and Workhuman for teams, so much great creative was produced  in a short amount of time. Dan and Lauren great work on creating and reviewing all the new content. Brian great work on managing the project and daily sprints as well as  jumping into code to work on Development. Matt thank you for working with us on the domain changes and redirects. Angela thank you for keeping things on schedule and organized in Workfront. Grateful for and proud of this team for what we have accomplished!\n\n198#Internal Live Blog Team|Another year, another crazy few days documenting all the great content at Workhuman Live. I want to express my gratitude to you - our internal live blog team - for your critical role in producing 9 live blogs covering keynotes, panels, and Q&A sessions in Nashville. This required quick writing (Lauren, Lynne, and Dan!), quick editing (thanks for double checking with eagle eyes Lauren & Dan!), and an eye for compelling stories and stats that will fuel post-conference content for the next few months (Lauren, Lynne, and Aaron!). Brian - I also appreciate your fast turnaround for getting these blogs on the Workhuman Live website, giving visitors and potential 2020 attendees a taste of what the event is all about. Already seeing some great traction on social with these posts. Thank you!\n\n199#Leading Human|Dan, in the midst of all the projects we are juggling right now - from re-brand phase 2, to Workhuman Live, follow up plans, and more - I wanted to send a quick note of gratitude for the way in which you \"lead human.\" This manifests itself in the way you trust your team to get the work done (whenever and however it is most efficient), but also make yourself available if we have questions. You're also not afraid to get your hands dirty and help share the load as work volume increases. And finally, I appreciate the way you lead with positivity and just focus on the most effective way to get the work done. By leading human, we can achieve anything as a team. Thank you!\n\n200#There's life after Nashville?|Dan, Jill, and Laura - While everyone is heads down preparing for Nashville, you are working hard on what looks like a kick-ass follow-up plan! Thank you for taking me (and  many others) through it over the last week to talk through 'all the things' - How does this impact Workhuman Cloud for Teams? How should sales and CS follow-up? What's the ABM strategy? Is the timing aggressive enough? Will this plan help progress opps?  It's shaping up beautifully with quite a few \"new and improved\" elements over previous years that will be exciting to test and see how attendees respond. Thank you for bringing a fresh, smart perspective to this important, time-sensitive initiative!\n\n201#The Great Communicators of Workhuman|I am grateful for your collective amazing work on the brand evolution in the past couple of weeks. Each of you stepped up in different, very important ways to ensure we announced it to the wider world (and internally) in an effective, meaningful way. There were twists, turns, changes - but you rolled with it and focused on the larger objective. And of course, as big projects tend to do, the time needed to get everything done crept into evening hours (and sometimes early morning hours given our global needs). And yet, you were all undaunted and got it the timing and the messaging right.  Well done team!\n\n202#Acceleration Kickoff Team|A big thank you and much gratitude to the entire team involved in kicking off our global internal 'review' of our top 5 customers! It took many hours of prep to do the research, thinking, and reporting for each of your areas of expertise AND then several more hours to come together as a team and review all of the great insights.  Thank you for digging in, thinking BIG, and committing yourselves to this important effort. One more review meeting to go! With every call we've made some connections, identified some opportunities, and put ourselves in a better place strategically.  Great work!\n\n203#Becoming Workhuman - Phase I achievement unlocked!|Team, I hope each and every one of you has taken a moment this week to appreciate what you have achieved. With ZERO external support (except for a couple of contractors doing \"find and replace\" logo updates, but that doesn't count) in just 45 WORKING DAYS (no joke) we have rebranded this great company Workhuman. It was beautifully handled and flawlessly executed, and you should all be so proud of your leadership and contribution to this historic moment. There's lots more to do, of course, but we have tremendous momentum, are off to an impeccable start, and I know we will finish strong.  I am grateful to be part of such an impressive team! We are living proof of the power of \"making work more human\". Thank you for all of your amazing efforts to make this happen!\n\n204#The room juggle|Dan & Ellen, thank you both so much for being so flexible when I've approached you (multiple times) to juggle some rooms to accomodate interviews. I know it's a hassle to swap and I truly appreciate your flexibility and teamwork. Having a candidate be able to settle into one interview room helps ensure a solid and smooth experience -  thank you so much for being such a team player on the \"great room juggle!\"\n\n205#Agile and amazing!|A huge shout out to the 3 of you for pulling together to get content in good order for the soft launch of the website. Maureen - you helped pull all of the content into a doc to be edited by Lauren - who moved at the speed of light providing edits and changing out old language from Globoforce to Workhuman. Dan - you jumped in anytime we needed you and were able to review the final doc Friday morning with a plate full of other things to tackle before your PTO. Thank you for being so agile and amazing!\n\n206#Content is King!|Laura, Dan and Sarah, wanted to give you all kudos for a wonderfully productive meeting this week on demand gen content. It has been a pleasure over the last few weeks digging into the content calendar and the demand gen plan for core campaigns and optimizing and tweaking as we find new data points. Dan and Sarah, thank you for your recommendations and willingness to try new form factors and Laura thank you for keeping this core demand ship moving, all so important to drive our business forward. Cheers to more amazing teamwork ahead!\n\n207#Dedication to Team Development|Dan - Thank you for all of your leadership with employee development conversations with your team. This is so critical toward building a great team. It is so important to put the time into this - and to be thoughtful and considerate. You have done both and also partnered with HR to ensure they have intimate knowledge for the great talent we need to cultivate. And to our talent, to making sure they feel supported and cared for as they continue to grow, learn, and develop their careers at the company.\n\n208#MLK Day Message|Team, thanks for moving quickly to help create the MLK Day video message commemorating today's holiday and its meaning in 2019. Building a media company within marketing starts with projects like this where we align with news and events that match our company values. That is certainly true of MLK Day, which celebrates a man who was a constant voice of humanity, compassion, and nonviolence. Dan, thanks for putting this idea out there in the original 2019 content calendar - excellent planning! Daisy, thanks for working quickly to block off Steve's calendar. Colleen, I appreciate your last-minute help in putting the internal message together so we could keep employees informed. Matt and James, thanks for being open to this idea and bringing your A-game to create a high-quality video that gets our message across. And finally Steve, thanks for stepping up to share this important message, and teaching me something new about how Dr. King's \"I have a dream\" speech unfolded that day in 1963. Looking forward to working with this team on more projects like this in 2019!\n\n209#Reviews in record time|Dan, there were some quick turnarounds today where I asked for your speedy review. Thanks so much for getting eyes on them so quickly. I really appreciate it, and the fact that I can always count on you!\n\n210#Connecting on Conversations Stories|Dan - I am so excited by the new case studies coming. The first - already approved and out to sales - was Qlik. And the second - coming soon - will be first First Tech.  Both of these started to develop from the HR Tech conference (and the panel), where you had such determination to pursue these new stories and build the relationships with our customers. Thank you for your leadership and tenacity. These stories are critical to helping us sell the recognition-performance story and connection. Thank you for all of your awesome work!\n\n211#Thoughtful cross-functional e-comm participation!|Thanks to this group for your attendance at the e-commerce quarterly meeting and for contributing your thought-provoking questions and ideas!  It is fantastic to have such engagement from partners across the organization and to see the buy-in you all have to our plan and progress.  It means a lot to the whole e-commerce team to see this level of commitment to everything we're doing, and you all brought up some excellent ideas that we will be taking on and exploring further.  Thanks for dedicating your time - please join us next time and spread the word!\n\n212#Human Assets|Dan and Sarah, I can't thank you enough for all the incredible work you've done to make all of our assets easier to find, up to date, and organized. Maybe you knew it needed to be done, or maybe you were just sick of hearing sales complain about it and you wanted to quiet us down :)  But whatever the reason, I've been able to find new, up to date, and very informative assets quicker than ever before via Sharepoint and Postwire. It's been monumental, especially lately, because I'm trying to utilize all the great work that Jesse and his team are doing by presenting these awesome new whitepapers, data sheets, science, studies, recorded Webinars, videos etc. to make compelling reasons for prospects to talk to me/us. And more than ever, I've found everything easy to find in an organized and central location in either Sharepoint or Postwire. And also, both of you have been quick and spot on with helping me recently on \"one offs\" when I told you what I needed and you created it or fixed something outdated for current use. You may deal with or create our assets, but you truly ARE the assets that keep Globoforce going!\n\n213#Rockin' the Rapid Response|All - awesome work with the recent rapid response video, blog, internal, and social post for Steve's response to the recent shootings.  This was a great example of how we can respond in an agile way to news that hits home - and aligns with our vision to make work more human.  In our work, we help millions of people around the world. What we do matters. Making people feel respected, empowered, and appreciated is helping make the world a better place. There are so many things that happen in our world that run counter to who we are as a company.  By giving our point of view and reflecting on how the commonalities of people (particularly in the workplace) are an opportunity for progress, we are helping advance the conversation.  Thank you all for your passion and enthusiasm.  And of course Steve, thank you for being that type of leader who truly cares and delivering that message so incredibly well!\n\n214#feMENism|I want to take a moment and give a big shout out to all the men who attended last week's first-ever-hosted Globoforce Women's Network event. Whether you were there as an attendee, a panelist, or just there to help live-stream our message to the world, your presence mattered. I'm a scream-it-from-the-rooftops feminist but I know that even if 100% of women stood up for our equality it would never be enough–we need you to stand up too. This isn't a social statement, just one of simple math: 100% of humans need to believe in equality for it to be true in practice. I've heard some men saying that they haven't joined the GFWN because they don't know what they can do. But it isn't about doing. It's just about showing up, witnessing, and supporting. You did all of those things – and it matters. Thank you.\n\n215#Content Calendar - Building the Future!|Team – You all did a wonderful job on the content/editorial calendar for 2019.  This is a new approach for us (and mindset shift toward our customer/user) – using our thought leadership and content as a foundational element for our marketing plan. Each of you were thoughtful, collaborative, and looked at the big picture.  The final product will greatly help align our outward-facing message – and make us a truly formidable marketing engine.  Thank you for all of your work and enthusiasm!  I can’t wait for 2019 and the future.  Kevin\n\n216#Sounding Board|Dan, I want to take second to thank you for being such a wonderful sounding board. Every week in our one-one-one meeting you start by asking me how I’m doing and if you can help make anything easier. Then I proceed to talk for 25-minutes straight and ask for advice on a hundred different things. You’re a great listener and always have a suggestion that comes from positive and supportive place. I appreciate the time you take to check-in during the week.\n\n217#One small courtesy!|Your one small courtesy is causing a ripple effect and I wanted to thank you. You don't know this but I am coordinating 11 deep dive sessions with 12 different departments, 21 individuals and 3 time zones! Holy moly! I wanted to put in a request for a temporary EA to help me haha! I was so close to the finish line and came upon a blockage. Because you are so considerate, you didnt hesitate when I contacted you to rearrange time and space with your team to make way for my need. A small courtesy BUT a big impact. Thank you for always being the kindest!!\n\n218#Marketing Leadership at Work!|Big Team - thank you for all the hard work and homework you put into preparing for the Marketing Offsite. It took weeks of prep, but we plowed through the entire organizational plan AND gave ourselves space for some extraordinarily creative and transformational thinking (who doesn't love THAT? ;-) Thank you for bringing your whole selves and giving your colleagues the gift of your undivided attention. Thank you for your leadership, candor and trust, and thank you for your DECADES AND DECADES of experience, put to work! :-)  As we all know, the real hard work starts now to get us to coherent and aligned 2019 plans, executing against those plans and tackling the big projects we identified. I am so proud to be a part of this team, and I meant what I said: I have NEVER worked with a more engaged group of people in my entire career. I am so excited about what we will accomplish together, and how we will contribute to accelerating Eric's thrilling vision for our company!\n\n219#Courageous Content|Dan, I wanted to commend your recent blog post for World Mental Health Day.  You had the great idea to tackle this hard topic through our content - knowing that as a company, we are not afraid to write about some of the toughest issues. You were sensitive to the topic, connected with the right people (who were already speaking at Globoforce), and were focused to get it right.  Thank you for always looking for areas to extend our thought leadership and leading with courage.   Kevin\n\n220#Conversations about conversations|Eric/Z/Dan- Millions if thanks for meeting with Stacey and I (multiple times) to kickoff a kickoff for conversations! We didn’t even know where to start and you were able to point us in all the right directions. We are grateful for the time you spent combing through assets, writing overviews, suggesting a flow and finally getting us to a great spot! Kudos to you for all the help along the way!! Thanks again!!\n\n221#Dan to the Rescue|We needed some urgent content for WorkHuman.com this morning to support our agenda launch campaign, and you didn't hesitate to jump right into action, providing exactly what the team needed. It's reassuring to know we can always count on a great teammate like you to get the job done right. Thank you!\n\n222#It takes a village of humans ?|Thank you team WorkHuman for your dedication, sense of urgency, and partnership on the agenda announcement last week. Dianne as always you kept the project moving and made sure we covered all the details up front and when we had last minute changes/edits. Lauren - you are so agile and easy to work with on the many, many, many different copy reqs and I am really happy with how everything came together thanks to your quick responses and thinking on your feet. Dan - thank you for being right there with us and making sure we get approvals on all the copy as well. Sarah - Your blog announcement was spot-on and will be a great piece for us to repurpose in social for the next few weeks as well as on the website! Speaking of website, Brian, thank you for being on top of all things workhuman.com and keeping us abreast of the metrics, goals, and sprints each week and especially as they relate to this campaign. Mike - you are a rock star, simply put! I know that last minute-edits to an email email after it is already in Marketo is not always the easiest ask but, you took that in with a sense of humor and made the finished product look and feel great. Pam - With all you have going on you were able to take time on Thursday morning to be the \"executive approver\" and make sure we got the email out by lunch time while I was working from home and not feeling great, I am so grateful for you! Finally, Jay and James - thank you both for helping to conceptualize and create a truly unique and engaging motion graphic video announcement for social! This was the ask that really could have used more time but, we knew what we had to do and you both took it in stride, and produced a really amazing video that is already seeing high engagement rates on social. THANKS TEAM! ✔️\n\n223#The dynamic 19 collaborators!|You're all \"good apples\" in my eye! Thank you to each of you for your help putting together the September Globonews content. The newsletter is no small effort and this past month there were 19 involved from all areas of the company to share information about all that's happening in Globoforce. Thank you for sharing your events, news, helping craft the messaging, and making it look great. Once again, so appreciative of the partnership I find every month when I reach out. Thank you!\n\n224#Customer Networking|Dan - Thank you for using your trip to HR Tech in Vegas to help build important relationships with our Conversations customers. You understand how important it is that we get some early case studies into the market and were quick to reach out post-event, make the ask, and introduce me to get the ball rolling. You even managed to get Vicki from Qlik to write out answers AND conduct a phone interview. Between this content and the panel transcript, I had 15 pages of quotes to work from for the case study. Better to have too much information than not enough! Thanks to your legwork, I have an initial draft of the piece which will (fingers-crossed) turn into a valuable marketing and sales resource. Thanks for your quick teamwork and initiative on this!\n\n225#Customer Marketing Plan Mavens!|Extended Customer Marketing team – this is a bit (ok, A LOT) tardy, but genuine nevertheless. We joined forces and pulled together a marketing plan several weeks ago to document what each of our respective teams were doing to help drive forth our marketing efforts to a very important audience – our customers. Throughout the final months of the summer, we were in major planning mode and had just put forth our first group plan for Conversations Then directly on the heels of that, we asked you to do a similar plan for Customer Marketing. I appreciate each of your unique contributions. As to be expected with a dozen or so contributors, there were multiple rounds of Powerpoint slide reviews with changes – some small, but some more complicated. We need more data, we need more details! We need more graphics! But wait, there's one more thing! No matter what I asked for, you were all committed and focused on getting the final deck to a good place. Now, with the plan approved, and many elements in motion, I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am to start seeing the results of all our work. I think I can speak for Pam, Stacey, Jill C, and Janet, when I say thank you, everybody! We couldn’t have pulled this off without you!\n\n226#My testimonial|A big thank you to everyone involved in getting the latest round of testimonials across the finish line. Kevin, you always take the time to review and ensure we’re putting our best foot forward – you provide valuable insight and feedback along the way. Shweta, you did a ton of follow up to secure approvals from our customers, ensuring they felt comfortable and were happy with the final product. Dan, you ensured the new assets were accessible across all of our channels and communicated to our Sales/Marketing teams. Matt F and Jay, I love the look of this latest round. Thank you for combining old footage with new footage, and for making us look good! Angela, thanks for stepping up to ensure this project moved forward in my absence. Matt D, you’ve done an incredible job with the resources page on workhuman.com – thanks for ensuring our testimonials are featured so beautifully. I feel very lucky to work with colleagues I can count on!\n\n227#Rocking HR Tech|Fantastic work at HR Tech last week.  It was great to connect and work with you on so many elements and projects.  A few individual highlights:  Erik – great job connecting with our customers on site.  What a fun dinner!  But beyond the dinner, you helped out in any way you could during the conference. Shweta – amazing work getting that panel set and working with all the right parties to secure our customers.  It was an amazing session that will help us for months and years to come!  Mike – your great relationship with Jason helped so much with the panel interest. Your work with influencers and connections with Microsoft during the show also go a long way!  Dan – awesome job taking all the right nuggets from the conference and getting the market insights we need.  You’ve also started the case study with our customers so we can build on from the panel to leverage for our Conversations marketing.  Well done all!\n\n228#Helping hands on HR Tech Handouts!|Thank you Stacey and Dan for your help getting Ro and Erik their handouts for HR Tech. It was a mad dash to get the product brief on Conversations to a \"print ready\" place by the time everyone was taking off for Las Vegas, and we ultimately had to find a place to print them onsite. Stacey - you didn't even hesitate when I was trying to figure out the most convenient way to get them printed and facilitated the entire online order. Dan, first you volunteered to travel with the printouts, and then when we found out we could have the order fulfilled in Vegas, you raised your hand to pick up the order for me and get them to Ro and Erik. I feel extremely lucky to work with awesome teammates like you two! Thanks again!\n\n229#Building the WorkHuman Agenda Puzzle|Team – incredible work by all of you in building out the first phase of the WorkHuman agenda and speakers. This was a process that began soon after WorkHuman 2018 with a call for speakers, which resulted in more than 600 submissions to go through!  Each of you played a key role in researching these speakers, vetting their work and stage presence, and making recommendations. And when we came together to review, you were open, shared your views and opinions, and worked together.  Making and baking the WorkHuman content cake is a complicated puzzle – all driven by the goal of building a world-class agenda that meets our business goals and aligns with our ambitious attendance targets.  Thank you for all of your efforts and enthusiasm.  Special thanks to Lauren for quarterbacking it all – and ensuring that the management of the speakers is in great shape as we enter the prime marketing weeks and months.\n\n230#Courageous leadership at its best|Dan, there's a Simon Sinek quote that comes to mind when I think of you as a manager, \"A star wants to see himself rise to the top. A leader wants to see those around him become stars.\" I want to thank you for always empowering me to bring my best self to my work. It means so much to feel supported, listened to, and understood as I move forward in my role here. From taking our grammar show \"on the road\" to trusting me with all manner of projects, you truly are a courageous leader - always steadfast and calm, always letting others shine, and I sure appreciate you for this.\n\n231#Copy. Content. Careers.|A huge thank you for all of your amazing help writing copy, reviewing drafts, adding content, getting creative, and ensuring our Careers page is on brand, well written and enticing to candidates! There was a LOT to do - between the department pages and each individual section on the site - all the way through to selecting the headings! You were both incredibly helpful, supportive, patient and on-board. I appreciate the thought, time and energy that went into making sure our careers page really shined. You are a pleasure to work with and I'm absolutely thrilled with the result. Thank you!\n\n232#Website content masters|Thank you so much for your invaluable work on the content for the latest updates to globoforce.com.  From new Customer pages to Careers and Department pages, you delivered it all on time and with the highest quality.  It's very empowering to be part of such a high-performing team and I consider myself very lucky to work with you.\n\n233#A Second Set of Eyes - WorkHuman Regional Forums|Dan, thanks so much for your making yourself available last week to review the first draft of the WorkHuman Regional Forums presentation. You got back to me within 24-hours on any edits and suggestions. With multiple presentations being created for fall events, we're on a tight timeline and your quick and thorough insights helped to keep the project on track!\n\n234#4th and 1 yard to go|After our onsite with Nike, we didn't know where we stood. On Tuesday last week, they sent us another request. One that we saw as a positive as they had given us an opportunity to continue to position Globoforce and why we are the right partner. It was not an easy  task with 12 questions, that required very detailed responses, and 5...yes 5 references that the wanted in their hands by Thursday. So a whole 2 days to turn this around. When it's 4th down and a yard to go, it all comes down to execution. Executing on what the team needs to move the line and get that 1 yard to keep the game winning drive alive. Everybody stepped up, took creative approaches, did their job and just executed on what needed to be done. It was nothing short of inspiring! Thank you for the effort and energy you put into those 2 days.\n\n235#A focus on Conversations|While a number of important marketing initiatives have supported Conversations since launch, until recent weeks we haven't had the opportunity or the bandwidth to come together as a team with a cohesive plan to increase awareness, drive demand and better supports the sales and customer success teams. The plan we presented this week is a framework we can build on to better reach the market with a compelling message, and to communicate across marketing and with sales. The planning process got us moving and shines a light on where we need to focus. Thank you all for making the time to contribute with already very full schedules --  a special shout out to Eric B for shepherding the team to get this done!\n\n236#Fast as a speeding bullet point...|Dan and Lauren, You both were absolutely AWESOME in catering to the needs of our prospect.  It was a plea for PPT creativity and Content support for a big executive leadership pitch for Globoforce.  Even though we are already Vendor of Choice (VOC), we needed to present our best arguments specific to the organization.  GREAT work by both of you to respond in 36 hours and then follow up with edits after as well.  We find out soon  if we're a go.... Rog\n\n237#Team Nike|Dan, Thank you for jumping in last minute during a holiday week to help draft up scripts and talking points for our Nike videos. It was a busy week with many people on vacation and you stepped up to make sure it got completed quickly. Thank you for always being such a great teammate!\n\n238#It takes a village|Thank you to everyone who contributed to the submission of our IHAF awards this year. Each of you jumped in to contribute, providing project descriptions, design files, performance statistics, helping to track down old video links, and overall making sure we were putting our best foot forward. Holly, you spent extra time walking me through all the workhuman campaigns from 2017 and into 2018 so we could get a big picture view of what was working (and not working) which will in turn influence how we approach the creative moving into this year. Angela, you were my partner in crime for the whole project - contacting print vendors, managing timelines, and putting together the final shipped submission. Thanks to everyone for making this a full marketing team effort. I can't wait to see how it goes!\n\n239#Deal or No Deal|Thank you Dan, Angela, and Alana for helping me put together a presentation for a potential customer. With Globoforce as the recommended vendor we needed slides that could be presented to their ELT. Dan, thanks for taking the time to set up a call with the prospect to identify their needs before you headed off to bootcamp . Angela, as always you were patient and flexible moving the project along with a less than 24-hour deadline. Alana, you brought the PPT to life (love the puzzle slide) and the prospect was very impressed. Fingers crossed the deal is sealed soon.\n\n240#Copy that|Hey Dan! I want everyone to know how agile and helpful you have been this past week with some script advising for several video projects. Taking time out of your banana-ram schedule to fine tune a demo walkthrough script, as well as sitting down to interview Ben, both for the upcoming Nike RFP. You were calm, cool and collect as always. Also, I'm trying to learn and adopt the copy rules you set forth. Please don't hate me if I mess them up! As with every video project you have stepped in to help with, your work was fast and of the highest quality. Thanks for going the extra mile to collaborate with us. Can't wait for the next one!\n\n241#Talk about an agile and dedicated team player!|Dan, we can't thank you enough for jumping in to help us with the video shoot today. Not only did you provide the team with an invaluable framework of specific, yet conversational questions in record time, you also moved around important meetings to be our off-camera talent guiding the discussion. You nailed it. Your calm demeanor, agility, and team-first mentality is always very much appreciated when the pressure is on. This was the 2nd time you helped us in a pinch and just want to say thank you X 100!\n\n242#Last minute video scripts for Nike|Dan- thank you for joining our kickoff meeting for Nike last minute and being so willing to meet our very tight deadline to have scripts put together for some important videos that will address their pain points. Your deadline turned out to be even sooner than I originally anticipated as we decided in the meeting we need copy first thing after the holiday. I know this was most likely another thing added to your plate while teammates were on vacation and knowing you, you most likely worked on this on your holiday. It didn’t go unnoticed! Thank you for joining and contributing to help this huge Nike deal! Love your “just do it” mentality.\n\n243#Ready for your close up!|In true Globoforce fashion, when I put the call out for photoshoot models, so many people jumped at the chance to help. A photoshoot like the one we held this week takes true teamwork and the work of many to be successful. I am truly appreciative for all of you who made time and were patient/flexible/available throughout the process. Thank you to those in scheduled shoots and for those I grabbed last minute who were willing to jump right in. The careers website is going to look AMAZING because of so many of you! We are going to have an incredible photo library of our incredible people doing incredible things. Thank you to all of you - I am truly grateful!\n\n244#Respect for Conversations Marketing|Team, you got it done! Thank you for your dedication to the Conversations marketing plan.  We had a tight deadline to from project start to check-in to executive review.  It was easy for each of you to deliver your information because you're so organized.  I appreciate your ability to turn around my requests quickly and provide the necessary detail to build the marketing team's Conversation marketing plan.  Thank you for your quick input and positive response to this project and for living our value of 'Respect for Urgency.'  Great job everyone.\n\n245#Thanks for the great start!|Dan, thank you for stepping up to introduce one of our most beloved WorkHuman speakers during the Framingham WorkHuman Wednesday. Your sharing of some of the behind the scenes fun details added to the moment. Thank you for starting off the session on such a fun note!\n\n246#Tackling the hard stuff|Dan, I wanted to say thank you for the time and effort you've put into the collateral updates thus far. Yes, I realize our work is not done, but I'd say we're very close to moving into the design phase for the product briefs for Conversations and Social Recognition, and as a result of our brainstorming, we have agreed upon a new approach for the WHC brochure which will make that a very valuable asset. With the launch of WHC, the way we need to talk about our solution has evolved so writing content for these new pieces is a challenge because there is so much overlap in terms of features and benefits. Of course, that's entirely by design and a good thing for our customers, but it hard not to be repetitive. I realize you are spread thin right now, but you never let that impact your attitude and positive approach nor the high quality of your work. I look forward to finalizing these important collateral pieces together. Thank you, again!\n\n247#Reverse interview team!|Thank you for being part of my interview team for the Recruiter opening! It's always interesting to wear the hat of hiring manager and sit in your seat and I greatly appreciate the time you took to prepare, interview and provide feedback for this critical role. I respect your opinion and value our recruiter/hiring manager relationship so much - thank you for stepping up and being MY interview team this time around. An interesting and very successful reversal!\n\n248#Sales Training|I wanted to send a thank you to the three of you for taking the time to prepare and deliver today's sales training session.  Being able to navigate and use the resources available is key to the success of the sales team.  Thanks for taking the time to deliver high quality collateral and helping us all learn how to access it.\n\n249#Team Oxford Comma|Thank you both so much for the content style reminders this morning in our marketing meeting. It's amazing how passionate we can get about abbreviations and sentence caps. I know it can feel like a small thing, but it has such a huge impact on our brand perception, so I appreciate you physically presenting this to make sure everyone understands the rules and why we make them. I can't wait for our next round of deep conversation around titles and how much I detest the a.m./p.m. treatment–thank you for carrying the consistency torch! (Please note that the title of this award is in title case!)\n\n250#Weaving Personal Story with Our Core Tenets|Dan, thank you for your contribution to the blog announcing the premiere of Steve's movie next week. Personal stories always perform best on the blog because they are relatable and human. You wrote a post that gives just enough history for those who don't know Steve's story, but also weaves in your own personal connection to Steve and ties in the themes of the movie to Globoforce's core tenants. I'm always looking to give our blog readers quality, compelling content that is true to Globoforce's human brand - and this post accomplished that. Thank you!\n\n251#Testimonial Teamwork|Kevin, Dan and Shweta, Thank you so much for your teamwork on the latest round of customer testimonials. You were all involved in the planning process leading up to WorkHuman. Dan and Shweta – you made time in your schedules on-site to meet with the customers, put them at ease, answer questions, and ensure everything went smoothly with the interviews. Kevin – I know you somehow managed to connect with as many customers as possible on site amid many competing priorities. Now you’ve all teamed up to review the latest round and help to prep the videos for customer review/approval. I really appreciate the teamwork, and the time you’re taking on top of all of your other work to keep this moving forward. I know the videos, and our customers, are in great hands with this team. Much appreciated!\n\n252#Swooping in to assist!|Dan, I can't thank you enough for responding, with lightening speed, to my request for healthcare references and white papers when I was at a conference last week.  I ran into a CHRO at a prospective healthcare company.  We were at a breakfast meeting and I needed some information on the fly. I took a chance and sent a quick e-mail to you.  Sure enough, you responded immediately and it was so very helpful.  It was amazing.  Thank you!\n\n253#Nashville here we go!|A huge thank you to both of you for jumping in with input and direction for the new Nashville branding. Jen, we're totally on the same brainwave lately with all the new Nashville stuff, and you've been powerhousing and pushing out email after email and banner after banner to get this thing ready to show. Dan, we asked you for some direction on where WorkHuman is going this year in terms of content and you took the time to add mood words, a new mission statement, content tracks and more to our initial deck so we could get off and running. It has been absolutely awesome to see how the two of you approach all the different aspects of this event - I can't wait to see where Nashville ends up!\n\n254#WorkHuman Customer Testimonial Videos|I want to thank you for you making time in your schedule to assist me as a content expert with the customer testimonial shoots throughout WorkHuman. There are many plans to leverage these videos assets in campaigns and they will help immensely. With all of our crazy schedules, non-stop blogging, meetings here, parties there, adjusting your schedule to make sure we got the goods from these shoots was a huge help and the final product would not have been as great without you. Thank you.\n\n255#Resources for Resources|This is a bit overdue, but thank you all for the various critical roles you all played in getting our new online Resource Center launched.  When we kicked off, the vendor told us it was generally a 8-12 week launch period.  They hadn't met THIS marketing department yet!  From integrating with existing systems to troubleshooting forms to creating, organizing, and entering content, you all took this project to heart and helped get us online in 3 weeks!  It was truly a mad dash and you all pulled out all the stops.  Great work and thank you!\n\n256#Guest Blog Gratitude|I can't put into words how inspired I am after #WorkHuman last week. So many ideas flowing both personally and professionally (yes, this is really true and not just something we just say in our marketing!) Dan - thank you for embracing my idea to write about the parenthood themes I noticed and for your guidance while at WorkHuman. It was totally organic how I just came up to you in between keynote sessions, told you my idea, and walked away from our conversation with a plan on how I was going to frame the message and tie it back to life events and the human workplace.  Sarah - you're baaaaack! Your keen eye and editing skills were the extra sauce I really needed to put the finishing touches on the post, especially in spots where I was feeling stuck. Bottom line - thank you both so much for embracing this idea and for being amazing, collaborative teammates.\n\n257#Onsite Eagle Eyes|Dan, Holly and Lauren,   I can't thank you all enough for taking the time to review the onsite email communications for our attendees at this year's WorkHuman. You were all busy with your own tasks and sessions but still found time to make sure our attendees were receiving a quality message each morning. Whether it was an Oxford comma out of place ;) or session locations/times that needed to be updated, you all did a great job with the review. I have such confidence knowing that we have this team in place to catch any mistakes that may need to rectified. You all were AMAZING and I appreciate all the support. I look forward to working with each of you on the follow up to come!\n\n258#Comms and Content Dream Team|This team was nothing short of AMAZING for WH18.  Lauren C – Flawless execution, unwavering determination, and smart work and management.  80+ speakers. You were absolutely dynamite at the event!  Dan – great leadership throughout. No matter what content was needed for our campaign, you were there!  Amanda – You had a big part in speaker selection, so many presentations, and customer testimonials. Shweta –  a key role in selecting speakers as well as proposals for keynotes. And who can forget the  perseverance in you getting Simon Sinek! There was media at the event plus customer testimonials. Lauren B – you infused a new energy into our WH copy and content. Creative, fun, lively.  Your words knit together an on-site narrative that flowed beautifully.  Sarah P –  You played a huge part in those speaker selections last year.  Who can forget there were 500+ submissions as well your idea to segment tracks by HR audience. Colleen – phenomenal internal communications leading up to the event – ensuring everyone had everything they needed.  You also gave our charities an experience they won’t ever forget! Kristen – sharing the WH experience with our employees. You also managed our WorkHuman fellows, giving them a week they will remember forever.  Aaron – so many writing hats in the lead up to and at WH – to support current and future follow-up.  Emily – so many great blog posts in the lead up to WH. And on site, you took control like you were running a newsroom!  You made it look easy.  Mike – 30+ influencers, 200 registrations (an incredible 4x increase). Also leading our social efforts, plus WH radio – with 23 interviews onsite!  The work and accomplishments of this team is incredible. It’s also the caring, and collaboration. Helping each other when needed and fillings gaps when seen.  I know we will continue to hear about more hidden heroics from this group in days ahead.\n\n259#WorkHuman.com All-Star Team|Thank you all for making WorkHuman.com a success all conference long! Over the course of 4 days we launched 5 separate versions of the site, each with up to date content showcasing the very best of WorkHuman. From our initial strategy meetings weeks ago to the launch of the 2019 Nashville announcement yesterday you have all been amazing teammates who have gone above and beyond to make sure WorkHuman.com and all of its content is a worthy extension of the WorkHuman brand. We're on to 2019!\n\n260#No rest for the weary!|Dan, on our way back from dinner tonight, I mentioned that I’d love another set of eyes on the press releases before I set them up on the Wire. You had just finished telling me that you woke up at 3:00 am this morning and had a long day. And, yet, you offered to review the press releases as soon as you got back to the hotel. I really appreciate this as this would give us a head start tomorrow. Thanks for always willing to help.\n\n261#Behind the scenes dream team|The new master slide deck is finally out after a multi-month endeavor to break down what we had, analyze what was working and what wasn't, and ultimately build something better....something much more aligned with where we're going as a company. Each of you - whether you realize it or not - played an important behind the scenes role in this process. When I first typed out this message, I couldn't send the award because I had grossly exceeded the character count limit. So, I won't get into all the specific ways in which you helped with this massive undertaking, but as we head off to WorkHuman, I did want to share my sincere gratitude for each of you. It's true when they say it takes a village to raise a child. YES, AND it also takes a village to create a new sales deck! THANK YOU EVERYONE for your help.\n\n262#Quite a Feat for Meet and Greets|Project managing meet and greets for WorkHuman is one of the hardest projects.  It is involves so many - and also requires a ton of responses from people outside the company (which is obviously impossible to fully control). Both of you guided the ship throughout and ensured that the lists were not only completed but met the goal of meet and greets in the first place (to give our customers and prospects a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet a celebrity or thought leader).  These types of experiences are great connection points to help strengthen relationships. Thank you!\n\n263#Super smooth|Team, thank you all for the great discussion about the meet and greet process for our employees. Everyone was so thoughtful about how we went about it and giving people the option to select who would be special for them was a great gift to provide. The team put employees first and I am certain they will be appreciative! Thanks for including employees in this one-in-a-WorkHuman opportunity.\n\n264#MnG Masters|I wanted to thank you both for the urgent and quick help getting a few Meet n Greets setup and changed. Your quick (almost instant) responses and help over the last few days made 4 of our prospects (all from different companies) EXTREMELY happy in regards to getting into MnG's or getting theirs changed. So thank you both for the continued and tremendous work and urgency you put in to help not only us all internally, but our prospects too. Much appreciated!\n\n265#WorkHuman Content and Comms Command|Incredible job showcasing your amazing work for WorkHuman - and educating the entire company on its value.  WorkHuman is an enormous team effort for our entire content and communications strategy and execution.  From the start of planning last year until now, it's quite clear that not a single detail has been missed and we are maximizing each and every opportunity to leverage our relationships with speakers, prospects, partners, customers, and the Austin community.  So much of it is behind the scenes.  Thank you for all fantastic, thoughtful work - but even more importantly, thank you for your positivity, determination, and collaboration.  It's a key reason why 2018 will be another incredible event!\n\n266#Always Helping|Dan - Thank you for always being available at any time to help with content requests. There's been multiple projects lately that I've stopped you and asked if you could help weigh in on the content. You dropped what you were doing to immediately come help. Thanks for always being so supportive and working as a team on projects. It's nice to know that we have such a good resource and team player working with us!\n\n267#Appreciate all of your help!|This past week we decided to create some last minute social assets for Employee Appreciation Day. Even with your busy schedules you were both super quick to help in reviewing the copy so that we could get them posted on time. Thank you SO much, we truly appreciate you!!\n\n268#Meet & Greets|Dan, you've been a huge help in organizing meet & greets for WH18. You are full of insight and experience from managing it last year with Michelle Obama and additional keynotes. With nine high-level speakers this year there are many pieces to the meet & greet puzzle. Thank you for guiding me through the process this year.\n\n269#Process Followers!|Thank you for using Workfront to submit your recent request. Especially for not walking over and asking \"Do I really need to submit this through Workfront?\"   I appreciate you following the process, especially during WorkHuman Madness!\n\n270#Web Copy in a Jiffy|Thank you all for the speedy (1 day) turnaround on re-writing the content for our new core website pages.  Throughout this project, you have all been such amazing teammates and I could recognize you on an almost daily basis for your contributions.  This is a fast-moving project, but having the support of a great team makes it all achievable.\n\n271#Calming those first program jitters!|Thanks so much to an amazing content team for your support on my first demand campaign, focused around the SHRM report. You were all so helpful through your guidance around Workfront, approvals and brainstorming and refining the content pieces. I greatly appreciate the support and patience, you are all rockstars!!!\n\n272#\"Fate cannot harm me, I have dined today\"|Thank you all for making my first dine around experience such an awesome one!  You were all great dining companions - gracious, considerate, interesting, open and funny.  Kieran, your \"whale of a tale\" is a modern day Melville classic.  Todd, sorry to have missed out during your Carnival days, but I hope to hear you play piano sometime.  Melody, your martial arts skills sound impressive!  Derek, I had no idea I was dining in the presence of descended Irish gentry.  Julie, your kung fu skills made me feel safer that you were on the walk back to the hotel with all of us.  Dan, that Who concert sounds like a once in a lifetime experience!  Sophia, snowboarders rock!  Ken, your daughter will make the Navy proud someday.  Stacey, I really hope your kickboxing class comes to the Framingham office!  And yes, I'd take a great feeling over a great fact anytime, and the fact is you all gave me a great feeling that night.  Thank you!\n\n273#Support + wisdom + humility = a true leader|Dan, I’ve only been at Globoforce little over two months and already I feel like this award is long overdue. Since my start date, I have felt nothing but support and guidance and kindness from you. In whatever task I’m given, you make sure to set me up for success. On top of this, you’re a person to emulate - your humility, your willingness to roll up your sleeves and help all who come to you, your commendable work ethic. I’ve had many managers over the years - some excellent, others not so much - but I hadn’t been at work a full two weeks before I realized you’re in a different category. You’re the kind of person who is a mentor, and I’m truly grateful and excited to be part of your team. Thank you.\n\n274#The show must go on!|Team - Thank you all for keeping our campaigns on track this week, even while we were away at Ignite. With everyone busy and away from the office, and our laptops, you were determined to launch our SHRM Report and Top Reasons to attend WH campaigns. Thank you for going above and beyond during a very hectic few days!\n\n275#Working through Ignite|Thank you Dan for making time to help us when projects came through during Ignite. (And having no fear as I scouted you out in the hallway during breaks) You are so nice to work with and flexible as our schedules don’t always allow much time upfront for content. You are very well respected for all of the great work you do. Another congrats on your SLC Award as well. Much deserved! Thank you for all of your hard work and support.\n\n276#Fierce Timeframe|Angela said it best when she wrote \"team, we have a fierce timeframe project\" coming up. It was really important to pull together this Conversations webinar with so many moving parts. You each stepped up to the plate without any hesitation.  Dan, you had other critical projects last week and you always made this a priority even at the end of the day Friday.   Lauren, you handled all the complexity of the tone and messaging with expediency and high quality work. And making slight changes to everything during breaks at Ignite.  Angela, you didn't shy away from mobilizing the team for this project and staying on top of every aspect even here at Ignite. Thank you for everything you do!!!  Diane, you have an amazing work ethic. Your job is never easy and dealing with all the nuances with the lists, the landing page, the email invite changes, etc. for this project. You were on top of it every step along the way. You are always there to work through the differences in our customer marketing projects.   I can't thank you all enough and for working on this during breaks these last two days. With a deep appreciation and gratitude.\n\n277#Strength in numbers|It's all about teamwork. To quote Helen Keller, \"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.\" Eric Bauer and I would like to thank you for taking time last week to go through the new master sales deck we've been working on for the last couple of months. It was helpful to have fresh perspective and we appreciate all the suggestions you provided to tweak the language here and there, and adjust the cadence of the slides to keep the audience engaged. As we begin to share the deck with others, it continues to evolve AND become stronger. Your input is invaluable, and will help us achieve our goal of delivering the best sales pitch ever. Thanks again!\n\n278#Agility with a smile|I came in this morning with a series of content requests from our Web design agency -- items they needed to keep the website redesign project moving forward.  You both dropped everything else you were doing (and I know how busy you must be) to spend hours putting these materials together so that we could return them as quickly as possible.  I really appreciate this commitment to the website project, and your willingness to upend your day to keep us on the fast track.  Thank you boh.\n\n279#Breaking News!|Team - I loved the energy in the marketing area this morning ...it felt like a news room full of reporters covering a breaking story.

Sprints. Moving Content Ahead.|Dan - The past few weeks have seen so many new projects, new concepts, and twists and turns to old projects - and everything in between.

All of these projects and ideas culminate in new future wins and expansion in the industry for Globoforce!\n\n281#48 hours in Austin|Thank you all so much for a well planned, productive (and fun) site visit to Austin. The combination of all of your creative, logistics, content, and marketing expertise allowed us to quickly weigh the pros and cons of each venue, visualize the experience, and determine how and to who we'd message it. We have an amazing experience planned for the Executive Forum thanks to all of you!\n\n282#Focus on Executive Customers|Thanks so much for such an engaging ideation session with the SCD team last week!  So many great ideas for driving engagement at the most senior levels of our customers.  We are lucky to have such great partners in marketing who are thinking BIG about the kind of impact we can have on HR Leaders and the industry as a whole.  We are all super excited to get our 2018 customer marketing programs in motion.  Thanks for being such great partners!\n\n283#Who wouldn't want to come work with us!?|Thank you to this great team of people who wrote the copy, designed the ad, kept us on track, gave great feedback, incorporated that feedback, and to the subjects of our photo who so graciously and quickly agreed to be included, thank you! We often hear that sales is a team sport, and you know what else is? Recruitment advertising! Creating a great ad to draw people in when they're looking at The Boston Globe's Sunday Magazine on Nov 19 is no simple feat! Thanks to everyone involved for the role you played in getting this off to print and for helping raise awareness of Globoforce as a top place to work. Well done!\n\n284#Amazing team spirit|Dan, I am so struck by how often you go out of your way with an offer to help a team member with a project, often adding to your own considerable workload. I've come to you for input, as have other new folks in marketing, and you enthusiastically engage in the project at hand with not just great suggestions but hands-on help. Your instincts are to give real support to your team mate and improve the project for the good of the business. It is quite remarkable. I want to thank you and let you know you set a great example of teamwork every day.\n\n285#'It's all happening!'|Walking out of that fantastic presentation, all I could think of one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite movies of all time, 'It's all happening!' - Almost Famous. You four put together GREAT out-of-the-box ideas that wowed Janet, Kevin and I. Ideas that we are excited to immediately put into production and get out to market! When there are limited boundaries, you all really shine. We can't wait to see it all in action.\n\n286#My Hero|Dan, If I could click on respect for teamwork, respect for customers and respect for quality - a culmination of all of these truly. I know we're getting closer to my being involved early. This was a big win for customer marketing so thank you for finding time during the video shoot with Derek to get some excellent customer-related content I can use in a compelling way. You always think about customers and put the customer lens on. You are so wonderful to work with, smart and talented and I'm thrilled to work with you! With deep gratitude!\n\n287#You epitomize \"Respect for All\"|During a recent interview process, while everyone liked a particular candidate, I wasn't convinced if the candidate had all the skills that were needed for the role. Instead of just going with the majority who voted unanimously in favor of the candidate, you listened to my feedback, invited the candidate back to meet with me and asked me to interview the candidate again and ask some really tough questions to pass muster. I was really touched by  your gesture and your commitment to hiring the best candidate for the role. You could have moved forward but you respected my input and opinion. This is what makes our team so great! Thank you, Dan.\n\n288#A-team|I wanted to give a big shout out to this team for getting together regularly so we can tackle challenges and support the whole team as a united front. I've appreciated the frank discussions and ability to share our points of view in a safe environment bent on making things better for everyone. Staying in step with what other parts of the team are facing helps me gain perspective of the bigger picture and set expectations with my own team so that we can offer better support to everyone's priorities. Our meetings make me feel like there isn't anything we can't accomplish!\n\n289#ALL THE THINGS|I just love working with you. You come to every meeting pumped up and ready to give 110%. Your approach has been so collaborative, you've taken on more and more work from WorkHuman video outlines to the new Globoforce case study–rewritten a whole bunch of ads and other small things when I needed you to. I cannot thank you enough for all the work–but more than that, it's the way you do it–always forward and with a smile! Just thank you for being you.\n\n290#WorkHuman Roadshow|Rebecca, Alice, Dan and Jenn, Thank you for all the preparation for bringing and inspiring WorkHuman for the customer success team.

Here's to the next roadshow!\n\n291#amazing video for Accenture RFI|Jess and Matt - thank you so much for taking my vision for the Executive Summary and making it into a phenomenal visual experience for our prospect!  From the quality of the video to the heartfelt message you all used your expertise to show how and why Globoforce is the right partner for Accenture.  Our company has worked this account for 5 years and we know so much about them and all of that came across in this video.  What a great way to differentiate Globoforce right from the start.  Our team will continue to run with it and make all of our hard work worth it!\n\n292#Content team to the rescue!|Thank you for your willingness to help carry all of the printed pieces in your suitcases for HR Tech! In doing this, you allowed us time to get them printed at a much better quality and saved the company what could have been thousands of dollars. I appreciate you working together to split the bundles to help save each other on extra weight! True team effort!\n\n293#Fresh and so clean clean|Team- From the very beginning everyone was a bit skeptical about refreshing our fabulous Hello-box, however the new design is so fresh and so clean! The work that went into this from the design, vendor updates, spec and pricing, meetings and reviews was endless. Every time we thought we had covered everything something else was thought of...a sign of true collaboration! So incredibly excited about all the new design and the additional offerings available to our stakeholders!!\n\n294#OOO Calendar|Thank you for using the OOO calendar so Angela and I are equipped to schedule meetings and deadlines. It is a small task that makes a big difference in managing your projects; we appreciate it!\n\n295#Meeting Coverage|Dan - Thank you for offering to cover for me today at a meeting where I was scheduled to present. I was not feeling well and you quickly offered to stand in for me so I could go home and rest. It was a very busy Monday for all of us, and I appreciate you taking this on today. You're a great teammate!\n\n296#Wile E. Coyote Cannot Catch You|Angela and Dan, thank you very much for your quick response to my request for content for the Accenture Premium Awards presentation.  You each managed you aspect of this project with the highest level of urgency given our short turn-around time and importance of this deal.  I am alway impressed by your professionalism.  Now, you've blown me away with your speed to complete the work.  Great job.\n\n297#Speedy reviews, day or night|Dan, I really appreciate your feedback on the blogs, and often on a very tight turnaround - sometimes involving nights and weekends or even just a couple of hours!  You are always there with a speedy response and thoughtful comments to improve the text. I'm always looking to be a better writer and you definitely help me to do that. Thanks!\n\n298#Holiday weekend urgent request|Eric/Dan- Thank you so much for your quick turnaround on the differentiator slide for the Frontier Communications presentation. It was an urgent request and a holiday weekend. I appreciate your dedication!\n\n299#Dedicated Detective at SHRM|Dan - Excellent work at SHRM last week playing the role of our recognition detective!  Staying ahead also means looking behind sometimes. You were able to glean some fantastic insights and competitive learnings from your work on the floor - asking the right questions in a very detailed way. These types of competitive insights are invaluable as we continue to fight the good fight to win in 2017 and beyond.\n\n300#Healthcare Content|Aaron and Dan,  Thank you for all of your help on the content for the healthcare campaign. We are ready to launch this campaign and couldn't have done it without your help. There were several different email versions that needed to be created and you made sure it was all completed and ready to go ahead of schedule. It is extremely valuable that we are able to make this campaign so targeted by focusing the messaging on individual job functions. Thank you for your expertise and attention to detail. Looking forward to working together on many more projects!\n\n301#Anything Goes|Thank you so much for all of your help with arranging meet and greets at Work Human. I came to you with some last minute changes which you were happy to help with.  THEN, I came to you with a request to add one of my clients to meet Adam Grant.  The client was already scheduled for another session but REALLY wanted to meet him.  You didn't hesitate and made it happen.  Not only did she get to meet Adam Grant, she also got to attend her original meet and greet session.  I really appreciate all you did to make this client happy.  You didn't know it at the time, but her company is a top 10 Great Places to Work winner for their industry.  You helped her see just how great Globoforce is and how we made it on to the list as well!\n\n302#The Action Behind the Action Plan|Team - Amazing teamwork on the WorkHuman action plan campaign!!! And yes, it deserves multiple exclamation points :). Dan, you worked tirelessly on the content and produced a great asset that will help our prospects take real steps to creating more human workplaces.

Thank you Thank you Thank you!\n\n304#WorkHuman Live Blog Contributors|Team, thank you so much for your dedication to the success of the WorkHuman live blog last week. In total, we covered every keynote and breakout session in 40 individual posts on workhuman.com. Each of you also displayed a respect for urgency, sending me content in the middle of the (chaotic) day and at the end of a (often very long) day. This was critical to the \"live\" nature of the blog. I could not have pulled this off without you and I know this content will continue to drive interest in WorkHuman 2018. Brian, thank you for your development work behind the scenes, making sure the blog was front and center on workhmman.com during the event and quickly updating the new content blocks with speaker quotes I sent you on the fly.\n\n305#Every minute, every request|Dan - thank you for your incredible work on WorkHuman.  Through-out this entire planning process as well  as the on-site experience, you were cool, calm and collected - and you delivered exceptional work.

And I know I learned a great deal from you over the past 5 months.  I also appreciate your grounded perspective and positive mindset.  In a crazy environment that is so important and I know your mindset helped me many times!  A tremendous thank you and I look forward to WH18!\n\n"
"306#The WorkHuman Roller Coaster|Dan - Thank you for all of your fantastic work both directing and contributing to the excellent new content published during the conference. The newsroom was certainly cranking out the highlights at lightning speed.  In addition to this, we had a potentially challenging situation come up that requirement immediate action - you jumped on this and made things happen.  During the course of conference, many different things arise but I'm thankful to have your steady leadership at every step.\n\n307#Content is King|I just wanted to take a moment after all these months of insanity to thank you for all the thoughtful, focused, collaborative moments that it has taken to promote, build and evolve everything that is WorkHuman. From every blog post, press release, social post, ad headline, and email down to the tiniest of blurbs on every piece of signage you have helped shape our voice and created a meaningful experience for everyone who interacts with us. It has been amazing to work with you all or just see the work fly by – without your fabulous words and message our team is just pushing pixels! Thank you so much for all that you do!\n\n308#Let's have a conversation|I wanted to take a minute to thank this incredible team for rallying around the new conversations landing page. We needed a quick asset to release at workhuman, and all of you jumped on it, despite full schedules and a tight timeline. I think the finished project will be perfect for what we are trying to accomplish, and we never could have done it without all of you. Thank you!\n\n309#Master of the Meet and Greets|Dan - thank you for doing such a masterful job managing the Meet and Greets for WorkHuman.  This is not an easy project.  It's a constant juggle that involves many people - to ensure we are fully leveraging these opportunities to enhance our relationships with both customers and prospects.  This experience is an important part of WorkHuman for many of these attendees.  Thank for all of your efforts and for continuing to maintain your positivity throughout.  Kevin\n\n310#WorkHuman Content Overload|Thank you for all of your hard work managing multiple pieces of content for WorkHuman and especially with the interviews for WorkHuman Radio.

Thank you!\n\n311#Regional Respect|hey Dan, thanks for going outside of your role and helping with greeting of customers and prospects at Workhuman London. I found it a unique experience to do this at such a great venue with you. Your natural charm was really welcoming at 9 a.m on a cold London morning. The content for the event was superb and has really helped with the follow up. Thanks and great to meet and spend some time with you!\n\n312#Know I know, and knowing is half the battle|Pam, Dan, & Holly -- What a great presentation you put together to get the whole marketing team informed on your post-WorkHuman ABM/Content Strategy.  You really hit the right notes giving context and background to each element of your plan, and just the right information so we all know what's in store but weren't bogged down in details. I came away feeling smarter about our strategy and more connected to your part of our team -- thanks!\n\n313#Dan the Man!|Dan - partnering with you on numerous WorkHuman projects over the last few weeks has been such a pleasure! You are focused, calm, and determined, all great qualities when it's crunch time!

I knew the topics I wanted to cover in my follow up but for the life of me couldn't encapsulate all of that into a reasonable sized email. It was Friday afternoon when we connected about this and you could've said no that you didn't have the time, but you said yes even though you truly didn't have the time. You had your daughter's dance competition all weekend but still found the time to get me a revised email at 2 pm on Saturday. Your work ethic, professionalism and sense of urgency is very much appreciated and I can't thank you enough!\n\n315#Thank you for your brain power!|Thank you for participating in the brainstorm to help us develop answers on behalf of the company for the Great Place to Work survey. The employee portion is now complete, and now we're tasked with writing about what it's like to work here and the programs and perks we offer. Thank you for talking through what you think makes Globoforce great, and for helping us think about the stories we have to tell and the photos we can share to bring our story to life. \"Teamwork makes the dream work.\" Thank you, for being part of this team!\n\n316#Dan-tastic!|Dan, thanks so much for re-arranging your work yesterday to fit in my small emergencies. There was a few fires needing attention you you graciously offered to stop and work on the job at hand. I appreciate your super attitude and fast proofing/writing. Thanks for all you do to make GF sound great!\n\n317#So many eyes|Over the past week you've been buried in proofs for notebooks and signs and more. So. Many. Proofs. We're not quite done yet, but 'almost there' feels like the time to share my appreciation for all your time, patience, not running away when you see me chasing you down.... Thank you for using the tool, adapting to it, learning on the fly. I can't wait to see everything printed and enjoyed by all attendees, and to share the group exhale with you! Thank you, teammates.\n\n318#The content master!|Dan, thank you so much for joining the west coast team call on Monday to review our content requirements and provide contextual input. During the past several months you've made a tremendous impact to the sales team, to help us locate the exact piece of collateral we need to address client pain points, awareness and customer enablement. We really appreciate your can-do attitude and support. Many thanks again Dan!!\n\n319#RFP Product Messaging Review|Dan,  I just finished making your updates and added in new messaging for the RFP DB. Thank you for working so diligently to get this content reviewed, updated and back to me. This new messaging that revolves around our thought leadership, IBM Index, WorkHuman, Innovation, etc. is what will set us apart with both our prospects and existing customers. I know reviewing all of this content can be a herculean effort, and my team appreciates you stepping up to make us better. Your work will help us get to the next level of the sales evaluation.  Thank you,  Michael\n\n320#Leading our Content to New Heights|Dan - It's unbelievable to think you've only been at Globoforce for 6.5 months. During that time, you've made a remarkable impact in bringing our content marketing to a whole new level. Since you started, you immediately jumped in and filled our content gaps - and in the process became a trusted leader and partner to both sales and marketing.  You display a level of determination and steadiness, alongside great enthusiasm and positivity, in producing a continuous feed of stellar work (from WorkHuman to sales to collateral to the web to much more!). No matter the project, you are always willing to jump in and help.  Thank you for all of your efforts.  The future is so bright for our content.  Thank you!\n\n321#Bridging the Gap|Thank you so much for putting together such a detailed brief for our new \"bridge the gap\" campaign.\n\n322#Flash Miller|Dan,  I can't thank you enough. Once we got word that First Lady Michelle Obama was speaking at WorkHuman, I had an idea to reach out to all Chief Diversity Officers in my territory. I came to you for help in creating an email that would catch their attention. You had 2 emails for me the next morning. Last night I used them and within 30 minutes of sending the email, responses started to come in. You are now my go to guy for creating attention grabbing emails.   Miguel\n\n323#WorkHuman Announcement Engine|The journey to publicly announce WorkHuman keynotes is a winding road of twists and turns. Stops and starts. Hidden cliffs and long straight drives to the end.  There are so many parts that play into a successful launch - and making everything look and sound great internally and externally and getting the wide world ready to embrace the share news, updates, and more.  Thank you to all of you of your continued fantastic work, patience, attitude, and diligence in making this year's WorkHuman line-up a sure-fire promo hit!\n\n324#Hmmm..how about....can we....|Dan, we have been going a million miles an hour the last two weeks for project MO and you have been a pleasure to work with. No matter what sales asked for from you, you put something fantastic together. Even as people changed their minds, asked for new things, or gave their opinions and edits, you did it with a phenomenal attitude and acted as a true partner. I cant thank you enough, you are a big part of everything we do!\n\n325#Tremendous Team Effort|Thank you all for your contribution to open up a new innovative opportunity for us to connect to customers focused on Diversity and Inclusion by illustrating to them how recognition is tightly connected to their D&I goals. Each of you collaborated and contributed to the Sales collateral that is field ready thanks to your imagination and determination. Lynette and Greg, I can't thank you enough for making the connection between the Belonging data from the GF/IBM EE Experience survey and inclusion. That data unlocked our ability to ask \"How are you measuring inclusion?\" to a whole new crop of prospects who I'd bet are challenged to measure it as easily as they can with strategic and social recognition. Dan and Amanda, thank you for listening to our innovative ideas and pulling the story together with compelling images and speaking notes. Even through the Saturday before I was presenting our ideas, you were both actively engaged and determined to put our best foot forward with external ready materials. Kevin, I could not have had such a complete set of materials without having your commitment, engagement and support of your team, not to mention your involvement over the weekend and morning of the presentation with up to the minute communication of D&I champions committed to WorkHuman. I sense another movement happening and I'm proud to work with each and every one of you - thank you for seeing and being committed to the vision.\n\n326#Volumes of stuff!|Dan - the amount of high quality content that you churn out is quite amazing.  I don't know how you do it, but you deliver, and deliver, and you keep delivering.  There is so much going on at GF these days, and so many roads lead back to content - and you are right there with thoughtful, strategic, high-quality, relevant stuff - all the time.  I'm sure you are looking to come up for air - but in the meantime I just wanted to let you know how valued you are.  Thanks for your on going contributions.\n\n327#Keeping Content Current|Thank you, Dan, for reviewing and rewriting large sections of globoforce.com to ensure that our messaging is current and accurate.  This was a project that was sorely needed and a gap in our messaging that I am very happy to have closed.  Great work!\n\n328#Crossing the i's and dotting the t's with a smile|Your eye for detail is impeccable! Your commitment to deliver quality content is remarkable! Your willingness to help is commendable! I can't thank you enough for always making yourself available to proof my copy. No matter how busy you are, you make it a priority to proof any content I send your way. And, you always catch stuff not visible to the naked eye:) It's so great to have you as the final line of defense!\n\n329#Crowdsourcing Award Names!|Dan - thank for your great name for one of our customer awards at WorkHuman. It was the perfect way to describe the award and I know the winners will be thrilled to win it at WorkHuman. Thanks so much for your teamwork and helping us \" crowdsource\" ideas.\n\n330#WorkHuman CHRO Outreach Campaign|Team - THANK YOU all so very much for your fabulous work on the WorkHuman CHRO outreach campaign. AMC and Anthony - amazing support creating 9 lists, Jen and Kelli - impactful designs for online and offline assets, Matt and Brian - quick turnaround on a new site and lots of requested changes, Aaron and Dan - fresh, compelling messages for this executive audience, Jill - setting up a custom CHRO registration experience, Stacey - getting the video of Eric done (and then redone), and of course Dianne for keeping us on track and on task! Great teamwork everyone!\n\n331#Mindful Meetings - Doing it Right!|I wanted to call out your participation in a wider team meeting we had yesterday.  It was such a great example of doing a meeting right here at Globoforce.  It was collaborative.  It was engaging.  It was open.  You all shared ideas - but also shared concerns about ways we could approach different opportunities - things that could make us more productive.  Questions were asked.  Solutions were brought to the table - with people building ideas off each other.  And it was also fun!  It should be the model for all the meetings we have here.  Great job!\n\n332#Hitting the Heart of the Message and Opportunity!|Dan - Awesome work in translating our new WorkHuman messaging approach into the CHRO collateral piece (and other associated communications).  You took our new opportunity to heart and the messaging came across really well.  This is going to be instrumental in the recruitment efforts - and getting HR leaders to see and know that WorkHuman is the place for senior leaders to go if they want to bring out the best in their people, their culture, and their business!  Kevin\n\n333#meeting madness|I just wanted to give you a shout out for the many meetings we've had this week-you've been my super partner. Thank you for always advocating for better process and understanding so we can really get the best out of the projects that are in place. You've been a calm and determined voice and you remind me that we're going to get there!\n\n334#Kicking off a revolution|When we needed to brainstorm some new campaign concepts for WorkHuman this week, you all jumped on board, immediately throwing out creative and fresh ideas. The resulting campaign concepts are original, timely, and impactful and I can't wait to see how they perform in market.\n\n335#Why? Why? Why?|Dan - thank you for jumping in and delivering updated web copy for the WorkHuman 2017 web site.  We needed compelling content around WHY clients and prospects should attend the event and you provided hard hitting, valuable copy that we will be able to use in many of our assets and tactics going forward. I look forward to seeing it help in our drive-to activities.  Sharing the why really completes the whole story for us!  Thank you!\n\n336#ABM at Ignite (X4)|Pam and Dan -  A huge shout out to both of you for a fantastic job with your ABM/Content presentation at Ignite.  For starters, Pam did an outstanding job giving ABM the definition and the context that was needed for everyone to understand how this new strategy will help drive conversion and impact the business.  Dan connected the dots to the content that is so critical to support this strategy.  You both demonstrated an understanding of the business, and the needs of the sales organization.  There was applause (i.e for the new Eaton case study); comments (i.e. \"I now understand what Marketing does\"); and a ton of positive feedback.  Your presentation was engaging as it delivered new ideas, new content and a new structure that is needed to hit the ground running in 2017.  I know how difficult it can be to deliver the presentation 4 times in a row, and you guys were fantastic.  Congrats on a job well done.\n\n337#Steering the Content Ship in 2017|Dan - I wanted to take a moment to thank you for all of your remarkable efforts in the past few weeks.  There has been a great deal of new content ready for sales use (and much on the way).  You've also created a strong content calendar for 2017 - which will help many collective teams plan and prepare for the year ahead.  Finally, you stepped up and helped delivered a great breakout session at Ignite - to show the organization where content is heading in the months ahead.  Thank you for your continued enthusiasm, expert guidance, and leadership.  So much goodness ahead.  Kevin\n\n338#Pivotal Peeps|Just wanted to give a shout out for some awesome go-to attitudes! It's hard to turn on a dime and with the WH.com efforts that have been in process suddenly needing to take a new direction, you all came with your \"yes and\" on and solutions at the ready. I love working with this team because everyone is so willing to do whatever is necessary to succeed–no egos and no naysayers. I know that we're putting the right people on this project and the end result is going to be amazing! THANK YOU!\n\n339#Marketing Hackathon Success|Thank you for making the first-ever Marketing Hackathon such a success! You embodied all our core values and the results were fantastic. The two-week Marketing sprint made us more agile as a team, brought out new ideas empowering every member of the team, and we found new approaches to market – ideas that could impact both our marketing approach and our go-to market for opportunities ahead. There was a buzz and vibe around the office that was felt by all your enthusiasm and accomplishment - all the way up the executive chain. Simply put, YOU ROCKED IT! Jess, Jill, and Kevin\n\n340#Stepping Up for WorkHuman!!|Dan and Aaron, Thank you both so much for putting together the Sell Sheet for WorkHuman.  This is a great tool to consolidate all the different messaging, events, updates and all the goings on of WorkHuman.  As we add things to use to drive attendance, you came to me and asked what we could use to better keep track of everything to make sure we had easy access to everything we have.  Thank you for producing this and getting to the team.  Its going to help us drive great attendance to a great event.  Thanks!\n\n341#WorkFront Pro in the making|Dan, you have only been here a short amount of time, and as I am starting to collaborate with you on more and more projects, I am noticing how efficient and timely you are when it comes to working in WorkFront. Your response time is within the hour and you always make sure to tag the correct people on the project. This is incredibly helpful to me when working on a campaign and juggling creative reviews. You are already using the proofing tool and markups correctly and this just goes to show how quickly you are adapting to working in WorkFront! Thank you so much for sticking to the tool!\n\n342#So Much Content, So Little Time|Dan, Just want to send a quick note to express my gratitude for your teamwork since coming on board not even two months ago. In particular, you've jumped right in to thoughtfully review and proofread blogs, eBooks, research reports, emails - the list goes on! You're also super responsive, often sending back reviewed content the same day I send it to you. You've quickly become an integral part of the content machine and I'm so happy you are here! Thank you!\n\n343#Product and Content Marketing for the Win|Dan, thank you for your support, input, and drive to create the internal product and content marketing survey.

I look forward to collaborating with you on future marketing projects, deciphering the data from this survey, and making an action plan based on the survey results.  Thank you and great job.\n\n344#The Brady Bunch|Kelli, Lisa, Dianne, Aaron and Dan- First of all, wow not even sure where to begin! Kelli/Lisa-  From the beginning you both really took this and ran with it!  It was a calendar coaster, then a calendar, and now a beautifully designed coaster that everyone just has to have! Dianne- Managing these changes was no small feat! You did it with such ease and kept us all organized. Aaron/Dan- The strong message and brand awareness brought into this really unique concept, was quite a challenge. Thank you so much for your dedication to perfecting and getting the final copy JUST right! I am so overwhelmed by the dedication from all of you and cannot wait to see results!!\n\n345#Making Holidays Happy!|Dan -  Thank you so much for all of your help in writing the copy for the holiday cards for 2016.  The beautiful sentiments you captured for our contacts in both the US and Europe will surely bring cheer to our customers and prospects when they receive their cards. Thank you for your help!\n\n346#Big Efforts Right Out of the Gates!|Dan - I've been greatly impressed by your efforts here at Globoforce - in a very short amount of time.  You've jumped right in with great ideas, sound strategic thinking, and a willingness to help in many areas (including gaps you saw).  To date, you've built a new messaging hierarchy for WorkHuman, started the 2017 content calendar, and so much more!  Thank you for your great enthusiasm and I look forward to the many great things to come out of content in 2017 and beyond!   Kevin\n\n347#Team spirit|Dan and Amanda,  Thank you for all your help with the CR Forum slide deck.  Amanda, you jumped on the edits right away and pulled the deck together! You have a great eye and excellent suggestions on how to make the content stand out! I really appreciate it.  Dan, thank you for your work on the title! You are always willing to lend a hand to take the content a notch higher and ensure quality control.  Lucky to have team mates like you!\n\n348#Catalyst Awards Ad|Creating an inspiring ad for Globoforce, tied to Boston's Science Club for Girls, for their Catalyst Awards program guide was a challenge you accepted! The timeline was tight, the space to fill was small, and after a couple of iterations we had the text, nailed the design and finished prior to the publication deadline. Amazing teamwork, project management and creativity on all fronts. Thank you for your help creating this ad, to which my contact said \"I LOVE this ad!\"\n\n349#Writing The Next Great Content Chapter|Dan - welcome to Globoforce!  You're a most welcome addition to the team.  You've only been here a week - but you're already making an impact, jumping in with great enthusiasm to projects.  In fact, you already contributed with great copy for an ad just a few days after you started.  Thank you for the energy and passion you've brought with you - an eagerness to learn our business, get to know your colleagues, and starting to build out the content vision.  I look forward to the months and years ahead!   Kevin\n\n"
