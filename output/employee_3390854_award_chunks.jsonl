Hari brought his practical approach to managing this much data and insured the team leveraged Chat GPT to take this very daunting task to a manageable level.  Jenn worked her white space magic and now we have 500 plays and opportunities in a manageable format to execute against.  All of this came together through Traci's passion for partnering on the reviews and seizing the opportunity to drive impact as a result of all the data shared.  Her guidance, creativity and investment in insuring the content output was able to be put in practice is nothing short of fantastic.

I gave you a kernel of an idea and in true fashion, you have upleveled it and helped to frame it in a way that demonstrates the impact it can have upon instituting these plays.  Not to mention, doing much of the analytics up to this point to support sizing the APAC project.

Let me start with the Executive Summary project - your leadership and vision to bring these to life was remarkable.  While we have done these in the past, you took a look and brought them to life in a new way, coordinating and leading partnerships.  We received amazing feedback from Executives at our largest customers (Abbott & Manulife to name just a couple), which drove more questions and more engagement which was exactly the design.  Next up, the Account Planning work you spearheaded for Activate was top notch.  Your leadership was so evident and your partnership with Lisa was amazing to watch both behind the scenes and on stage.  And last, but not least, the work you have been doing behind the scenes with both the Renewals Project and Account Planning reboot has been transformative.  You consistently live up to your title in transforming the strategy for our team.  Brava Rebecca!\n\n24#Jumping In to help with UHG|All, a big THANK YOU for jumping in to support on the UHG RFI/RFP.

We spent time building momentum around how we unlock doors with executives, gaining full adoption of the Workhuman cloud, reaching new users on the platform, increasing investment and renewing our vows with longstanding customers.  The engagement that I saw when we discussed the roles everyone plays in supporting our customers, how you partner together and the achievements that have come from those partnerships was profound.  As we often hear, it takes a village - well I'm so PROUD to be a part of this village.

I truly enjoy collaborating with you because you approach problem solving with the same eagerness and curiosity I would imagine a rubik cube champion would! That coupled with your knowledge of our internal systems, processes and your customer management experience has been invaluable as we  navigate through the thick forest and mud that is phase 1 of identifying, consolidating and operationalizing customer data that will allow SCDs to proactively identify opportunities and risks.

It sure takes a village to set a winning strategy for one of these adventures and I’m grateful to have the crème de la crème on the team! From pricing to communications and strategy to building a profile for our top executives to churning out reports and analytics (the list is endless!) each of you have showed up at your best in every meeting, every impromptu conversation and every curveball we’ve had to manage through in your diverse areas of expertise and the journey continues as we cross over another milestone at the finalist RFP at the end of this month.

Thank you each for bringing your very thorough and thoughtful action plans along with ‘visual aids’ to share over the last 2 lonnnnng dayz! We focused on what you’ve identified for the final few months of 2022 and it was incredible to hear about your progress and your dream scenarios. Im always so impressed by the brain power that exists on the team and the level of ‘yes, and..’ that happens when we come together. Special shout out to Leslie, Rebecca, Abby, and the Goat, Traci P for bringing us thoughtful process and useful air cover and unique collateral to help us focus on Team Awards, Multiple Programs, and Renewals. Lets do this ‘Season of Giving’ the way we know how!\n\n32#Visionary of All Visionaries|Rebecca, I have to say that you truly are a visionary like no other!  More times that I can count I have shared a challenge with you, and you go away and then comeback with an approach that nobody else could have dreamed up. The challenges with capacity on World Gratitude Day sparked a brilliant idea from you to create a unique experience through Community Celebrations that allows employees to come together to celebrate WGD as a company. This experience is so engaging, allows us to showcase community celebrations in a different way and delivers on the Workhuman vision.  You truly are a remarkable partner and thank you for consistently looking for the \"here's how we can make it happen\" solution!\n\n33#Creating new deliverables that secure our future!|Rebecca, you did it again! That creative mind of yours! I can't thank you enough for all of the work that you put in to creating a brand new format for our business proposal for Merck's contract renewal. Utilizing some new features in PowerPoint, you created a business case & value proposition that really came to life. I know that this gobbled up many hours of your time as we needed to pull this together before the meeting with Merck procurement. Very professional & full of valuable details that are ready for them to present their business case internally as well. With so many renewals coming up, I see this as the new standard for delivering this type of proposal. Masterful work indeed!!\n\n34#WHL Strategic Accounts Team Success|HOTLANTA! Well done to this team of fabulous people! We got to reunite with old friends, new friends, and each other! You worked tirelessly to get the right customers to attend and really engage with us and it really paid off. I was so proud watching you all connect with our customers and see how proud they were to be hosted by you! Each of the customer speaking sessions was FAB! Mike Malloy could hardly contain himself—he may want a fulltime gig! Even GE was beaming! So many customers from so many accounts—many first timers! You all worked your tails off to be sure every customer felt great about their experience and managed to unearth some new insights and opportunities! Well done to each of you and to this fantastic team. You show up for each other and for customers in the very best way…every time. Cheers!!\n\n35#Abbott Sales Program Express|Rebecca and Mark we had nary a few days to pitch a solution to Abbott Lab's new Global Head of Procurement who was shopping around for eGift Card for their Commercial and Corporate Groups. Rebecca you exhausted all avenues to make this a reality for Abbott and as it became clear this would not be a good option for them you created viable alternatives to present to Abbott. The options were precise and effective giving the Abbott group pause to reconsider their narrow ask. Mark the quick turn around on key data points to support the call and the comprehensive demo of the two multiple program options were excellent and I am grateful for your partnership on this account. We may not have sealed the deal on the spot but we did give them lots to think about and a credible shot at the prize.\n\n36#The BEST team on the Planet!|You all are a team of fierce, focused and determined humans!  I am so thankful to have a front row seat to watch you pouring your heart into all that you do to support our customers and grow the business for Workhuman.  Each of you inspires me beyond measure.

We then gathered in my city by the Bay for another few days of collaboration, ideation, and BIG idea sharing. What a fantastic few days! Thank you for your commitment to this process, for showing up with your whole selves, for being supportive and encouraging of each other, and for making me laugh so much.

We missed your presence physically but we felt your presence virtually!) Safe travels home and happy weekend! #bestteamevah\n\n38#QBR inspiration|Thank you each for the inspired prep, collaboration, and delivery of insights and ideas for the team this week.

Also special shout out to the fabulous Abby and Traci---you are an Inspiration Army! Thank you!

In that spirit, found some old photos to commemorate this recognition moment! I can't thank you both enough for jumping right to help sort some urgent updates to the P&G demo website which always seem \"easy\" in theory but never in practice, right? The old \"how can we\" speak ... add and delete Life Events awards for a particular user in a cloned website for an upcoming executive meeting. The two of you are my go-to's for so many things and it's delightful to know your high standards of communication and delivery never disappoint! You not only think through how to accommodate the request but test it yourself to ensure all is 100%. I dropped everything to help out and solve. That's true collaboration, customer success centered, and colleagues and friends for life, stuff!! THANK YOU!!! YOU ROCK!!\n\n40#And, we're off!|This team had one heck of a year and they're already out of the starting gate to take on 2022!

For many in the states this meant a very early morning and like SE’s mission of “the moment you’re up – so are we.” It was evident today, everyone on this team lives, breathes and is fully committed to supporting SE and aligning social recognition directly with SE’s people, culture and business goals! Our pillar of Relationships stood tall. You all are writing the book on 5 steps to build long-lasting customer relationships, 1. Communicate what’s possible, what’s available today, how does this tie back to your talent and business goals. 2. Tell the truth – Chris C, amazing job in setting and managing expectations around the product and capabilities. Demonstrating call after call, we hear you, we’re committed and driving towards deadlines. 3. Make Their Lives Better – bring subject matter expertise, guiding them on their journey, what’s in it for SE employees, sharing industry best practices, and making SE’s program team’s day jobs easy. 4. Allow them to experience the Workhuman brand – the agenda, back to the future video, customized demo site, and making each “moment that matters” resonate. 5. Make them feel special – Our words, actions, high level of engagement, and warmth in dialogue all points to you are special Workhuman family members. Paul, Chris C and Traci, thanks for your imagination+ determination = innovation spirit and grit, carrying the key messages, wrapping concepts with illustrations and demonstrating our brand. Steve and Jose, for all your support over the years and today. Rebecca, Melissa F, Brian M, Dan F, Geoff, Alan, Brian K and Jesse A – for setting up the demo website, making it personal, relevant and resonate and the final presentation, a masterpiece!\n\n44#Creating the winning narrative for GE!|What a team effort to pull together an impactful deck/story for Eric to deliver at the GE leadership meeting! Jen, wow can you create an engaging story and quickly I might add! We learned very last minute that the format of the meeting with GE had changed to a keynote and you jumped right in and delivered an exceptional storyline. Very special thanks to Richard & Eileen for your strategic direction in making this succinct and relevant to GE's audience. Traci, you have been so incredible throughout the execution of this opportunity. You've attended every meeting with me to plan this and your ideas helped to shape the vision for this meeting, right from the start. And although you were enjoying your time off while the change in format surfaced, you jumped right in with a helping hand, providing exceptional finishing touches to this effort. Rebecca, you are the constant in all of this, we've been working together to pull together our follow up and you were so helpful in securing an execution plan to get these leaders to WH Live, Atlanta and to keep the conversation going!  This incredible effort will lead to big changes at GE, for the better! Thank you!!\n\n45#It’s ELECTRIC (boogie-woogie-woogie)|My 7-year-old self often wondered why I was made to do the Electric Boogie (a.k.a. “the electric slide”) in first grade gym class. Why were they making me do this? Who is singing this song? Why are we dancing in a line? When will this knowledge ever be useful to me? Well now i have the answer to at least some of those questions… A huge thank you to everyone who participated in putting together the Schneider Electric renewal proposal – it was a lot of hard work, but the results were electr— (well, you get the idea!)\n\n46#Onboarding Help|Thank you Rebecca for being so helpful during my first week of onboarding! I so appreciate you assisting by no only being my buddy, but also in setting me up for success by advising where to go for the right resources and adding me to spaces in which I will find inspiration for client strategy.\n\n47#Intuit Strategy Session|WELL DONE, Ladies! Our Strategy Session with Intuit to help them envision the new generation of their Spotlight program was a great success. Rachel, Rebecca, Maggie, Melissa, and Kat, I can't thank you enough for all of your efforts and dedication to this opportunity. As you witnessed, there are a lot of layers to this account and their resistance to change. Still, you all did a fantastic job addressing their concerns and questions and helping us keep the momentum alive. I truly appreciate your leadership, collaboration, and engagement during the meeting and onward.\n\n48#Paving the way at the speed of light!|Rebecca!! Thank you so much for jumping in to help on an upcoming meeting with the exec sponsor of Merck and creating a deck to showcase all of the benefits of celebrating EBRG's with their own program! This is a newer concept for us and we truly needed someone to pull together our strategy and lay it all out in a compelling presentation. Not only did you create an amazing deliverable by devoting many hours (even in the evening away from your family) but you presented our messaging directly to the client with such passion.  That is true dedication and incredible creativity!! I am so grateful for all you bring to our team, but this was just especially awesome!!  Thank you!!\n\n49#Gratitude for your FIRE!|To this incredible team of pros, I hope you are dancing alongside me (virtually) to our theme song! You are the Fire in the band! How lucky are we all to work together and make work for millions of people centered in gratitude?! I'm grateful for each of you every day and inspired by your passion, drive, and leadership. Dance a little, sing a little, and feel celebrated---Never was a cloudy day!\n\n50#It Takes A Village. A Very Large, Large Village.|Talk about it takes a village! Rebecca, Dan, Brian K, Jesse, Brian M, Geoff, Leslie, Danielle, Rich, Amy, Kat, Maggie, Melissa, and Rachel, I can't thank you enough for your efforts and collaboration on Intuit's long awaited program refresh. This opportunity has been years in the making. Getting Intuit to agree to modernize Spotlight's foundation and employee experience was no easy feat. But it pales compared to the countless hours of work and people it took to get us ready once they said yes. Their kick-off strategy session is around the corner and I've couldn't have done it without all of you. Leslie, Amy, Danielle, and Rich, I'm so grateful for your leadership to ensure we had the best team in place to support Intuit and this important initiative. Dan, Brians', Jesse, and Geoff thank you for happily joining the team and creating a custom demo. The site is gorgeous and an essential part of our strategy.  I'm so excited to share it with Intuit's leadership team to help them envision what their optimized program can look like. Maggie, Rebecca, Rachel, Melissa, and Kat, thank you for your thought leadership, guidance, and expertise. Your partnership during our many, many internal prep meetings has been a godsend. You ladies have gone above and beyond - from collaborating on the blueprint of the go-forward strategy, mapping out a project plan, doing CIA level research on key contacts, to ensuring the client experience is tailored and memorable. No stone has been left unturned.\n\n51#Transforming the Future|This team is beyond INCREDIBLE and the TRUE DREAM TEAM!  As I think about the future of where Workhuman is going and the experiences we are working diligently to create in partnership with our customers, knowing all of you are leading the way makes me beyond proud.  We spent an incredible couple of days together leveraging our 'Empire State of Strategic Minds\" and worked with determination and passion to identify, align and set a path forward for what is next, how to get there, and take us well beyond a $1B company during our QBR session.  The level of strategic thinking, passion and determination you all demonstrated was truly inspiring.  The transformative strategy you all have outlined is what is going to move us forward in all the best ways with focus on our customers digital transformation, sustainability, agility, inclusion and equity efforts and beyond.  I can’t wait to see where the vision takes this team and the relationships you have built. Amazing work team!\n\n52#What slowdown?|Team fab. Every week I read your Strategic Insights and am blown away. It's actually a challenge to summarize the incredible work you are doing. Week after week, you are outdoing yourselves. The work that is happening today is work that we were only dreaming about a few years ago! You are truly setting a new bar weekly for us and forcing us to think bigger and bigger as an organization. Thank you for the work you are doing daily, conversation to conversation, meeting to meeting, internally and externally to make incredible things happen. And it's not just the work with customers, the collaboration and teamwork that you demonstrate every day makes me super proud. Thank you and Bravo!\n\n53#Integrating me to the SCD Team!|One month in and I have had such productive one on one conversations with each of the broader SCD team including also Traci and Becky.  Thank you to everyone for being such a productive, positive and meaningful addition to my onboarding.  There is so much to learn from all of  you and I am so thrilled to be a part of this team.  Thanks for leaning in and helping me get up to speed!\n\n54#Global Account QBRs—Synergies!|Super excited after our two day meeting (i mean, with the time change, it was days right?)! You all brought your A game and applied the WH ‘MRI’ machine (T Pesch trademark) to our 6 biggest opportunites. We have so much great trouble to get into! Thank you for your energy, professionalism, creativity, ... but mostly for your teamwork and collaboration. I love this oportunity we have to focus and drive big growth.  The impact to the business is gonna be huuuuuge. Bravo!\n\n55#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n56#Making Sparks Fly|Huge THANK YOU to all of you for an incredible Quarterly Business Meeting today!  We could have spent the entire 3 hours celebrating all of the amazing work you all are doing. You all are the visionaries leading our customers into the Future of Work and helping them to build cultures that celebrate their employees.  The work you’re doing is fundamentally inspiring employees to feel valued, included and recognized for their contributions and unique perspectives.  As we continue to drive towards our goals for the second half of the year, I am certain we will continue to make sparks fly in all the right ways.  Your dedication and passion for the work we do is unprecedented and so evident in all you deliver.  I continue to be blown away by the talent each of you bring and can’t thank you enough for everything you do to support our customers.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n57#WHLO Chat Ambassador|Thank you for stepping up to the plate and being a “chat ambassador” for Workhuman Live Online. When I reached out to this team of early session registrants to monitor and answer questions in the breakout room chat sessions, some of the amazing responses I received were: “Sure, whatever you need”; “Absolutely!”; “Happy to help”; “Of course!”; “How fun! I’d be happy to!”. These types of positive responses are a true testament to our team of amazing team of humans at Workhuman. And your willingness to help up-level the communication during these sessions made a world of difference to the events team, and for that we are grateful! WE APPRECIATE YOU!\n\n58#Power of You = Strategic Mindsets, Passion & Goals|It's the Power of YOU, Leslie and Rebecca, that's making a difference as we near the final stages of renewing our P&G partnership and get a \"Yes, absolutely it's WH for the next 15 years.\" My instincts say the two of you just participated in The World Economic Forum study on Want to achieve success? Develop a strategic mindset! Definitely, definitely you did and raised the curve! Leslie, you fit the definition to a tee: sees the big picture, constantly imagines future scenarios, and creates strategies to sustain competitive advantage. Is a visionary and able to articulately paint credible pictures and visions of possibilities and likelihoods and formulates a clear strategy and maps the aggressive steps that will lead to success!! Yes, all of it for P&G!! You have been leading with your strategic mindset since day one, building strong relationships, cultivating c-suite partnerships, advocating for Power of You, showing P&G the scale and power of the PoY, expanding investment, and sharing future possibilities. Because of all the work, the P&G finalist pitch seemed more like a \"family get together\" to check in on each other than a competitive, hostile session like years past! Rebecca, your strategic mindset, seeing ahead to future possibilities and translating them into breakthrough strategies with the P&G cloned next gen website was brilliant! It's much easier to latch onto innovative when you experience it first hand, it's relevant, it resonates and makes so much sense. That's when breakthrough happens - by the end of the meeting P&G was talking about evolving their program to the next level and saying things like \"Expanding PoY, Life Events, Creating Moments.\" THANK YOU both for always asking yourself 'What are things I can do to help myself and others achieve success? Is there a way to do this even better?\" It's your strategic mindset and breakthrough strategies that are GAME CHANGERS!!! You Rock!!\n\n59#Moonshots for P&G|Rebecca, your vision to bring to life the next generation of the Power of You at P&G is beyond measure!  You set in motion a massive research effort to bring to life key personas we had identified at P&G as our next set of voters.  You uncovered their passions, how they are personally aligned to the major initiatives at the organization and how they are leading and driving the culture.  Next, in an effort to truly help the leadership at P&G understand the further impact the PoY program can have, you imagined a cloned site demonstrating the power of the WH Cloud.  You pulled stories from LinkedIn that aligned with the key things P&G cares about – I&D, Sustainability, Doing Good for others and beyond.  You found those moments that spoke to key employee highlights – CEO awards, YOS, retirement, Weddings and set to work illuminating them in a way that only the WH Cloud could bring them life and celebrate them globally across all of P&G.   Amanda, wowza did you ever deliver in uncovering so many perfect nuggets and bringing them to life on the new POY site.  Your dedication and fortitude in creating the next generation of this program was so apparent!  While this will most certainly make an impact in our efforts for the RFP, the vision is way beyond that in creating the why for leadership.  They can now experience this as if it were their current site, play around and dream big.  This is overshooting moonshot thinking and I couldn’t be more amazed by your strategic thinking, leadership and commitment to driving an incredible customer experience!\n\n60#Q1 WH Experience Action Planning & Review|Team, a huge congratulations on our Q1 Action Planning review session this week!  Even though we lived this quarter together with regular updates individually, I was still blown away to sit back and see collectively the incredible work that each of you have delivered over the past quarter! Our new action planning methodology allows us to be focused, effective, efficient, and provide tremendous visibility across the team. It is phenomenal to see your work driving our business outcomes and as we sit back in review and future planning, I cannot help but notice how interconnected and interweaved our work is! This is testament to the intention behind each initiative, each activity and ensuring that we are investing our energy in driving our business outcomes. Some of the things that struck me as I listened to each of you is the resilience that has been demonstrated – pivoting, stopping, starting, revisiting, evolving etc.; the broad range of impact that we are having across all areas of the business - partnering in driving business outcomes by supporting and collaborating with our colleagues from across the business;  strategic thinking – the big picture moonshot thinking delivering huge impact for our customers and business alike; the innovation – pioneering new thinking and methodologies to differentiate ourselves in a very special and human centered way and the resourcefulness and self-educating to deliver with exceptional quality on our objectives. The impact on me is an immense amount of pride in our team, in each of you and in our accomplishments; excitement about what lies ahead and confidence in our ability to deliver a tremendous amount of ROI to the business by driving both our human centered and business outcomes in a very intentional and scalable way! Well done team, I am honored to work with such a creative, passionate, inspired, collaborative and determined group of people.  Thank you!  I appreciate each of you!\n\n61#Game Changer Experience Initiative|Becky, the video says it all and I know I’m not allowed to give away too many details yet! You have just wow’d me with your update on the persona project. From your initial brilliant idea and the concept you shared at the outset to what you have delivered thus far - the almost finished product - I could not have even dreamed of what it has become! I cannot wait for you to share this brilliance more widely as soon as you are ready! Exceptional job, you should be so proud of your work and your amazing idea becoming a reality. Well done Becky, let your brilliance shine!\n\n62#Dream Team Building the Future|Amanda and Rebecca, Wow – talk about the Dream Team helping to build the future at P&G – you two are leading the charge!  The thought leadership and commitment to perfection you displayed in building out the Lucid Chart for P&G is nothing short of incredible.  You made sure it was executed as thoroughly and thoughtfully as possible, but ensured it was meaningful and relevant.  Amanda, you even went the extra mile to do a video on how to navigate, update and leverage it going forward.  I am simply blown away and I can’t thank you both enough for your commitment and determination to delivering the very best.  #DREAMTEAM\n\n63#In sickness and in health|Becky, this award is long overdue for the amazing support you've provided (and always provide) to me both in my personal and professional life. I have had a very trying year with lots of ups and downs and you have been right by my side coaching, facilitating, rearranging, and giving advice. The amount of times I have had to call you crying or in crisis mode are probably too many to count at this point, but each and every time you are right there with a listening ear and huge heart. I honestly don't know if I could have made it through the last 12 months without you by my side and I cannot express in words how much that truly means to me.   In sickness you were right there to rally the troops to make sure the work kept going and our progress continued. You checked in on me, shared tips on how I could feel better and made sure I had peace of mind to rest and heal. In health you are uplifting and constantly creating moments that matter to me, just by being the wonderful human you are. You continuously show me how much you value me and my work and surprise me with things from my JOY list. A true mentor. A true friend.   On employee appreciation day, and every day for that matter, I appreciate YOU. You make a difference in my work, my career and my life. I am just so grateful for you! THANK YOU.\n\n64#THANK YOU FOR THANKING|Thank you all for your video submission for Employee Appreciation Day! While this day provides a wonderful reminder for all of us to reflect on the efforts and innovation that each of our humans bring to the table - we all know that our spirit of recognition and celebration is one that lives on all year long. There is no greater example of this in action than the recent call for video submissions from people leaders for an Employer Brand campaign. When we asked for some videos from people leaders thanking their team members, we were OVERWHELMED with video submissions - much more than we could incorporate into one or two snippet videos!  Your videos will remain live for all your team mates to see (see slack for link). Thank you all so much for taking the time to show your gratitude and enhancing our culture further. Even in this remote world you are all creating moments that matter, so thank you.\n\n65#I appreciate you!|Team - you are without a doubt the best humans to get to work with every day!  I love you; I respect you and I am so honored to get to work with you each and every day!  I hope this little video makes you smile today!  Thank you - you are AWESOME!  2021 is going to be a magnificent year for our team supporting the company moving solidly into the Intentional zone!  You are a critical piece in this realization - well done!!!  Be proud! I am of each of you!\n\n66#Visibility 2021|It's February 18! We're almost halfway through the quarter! What a whirlwind 2021 has been. Thanks to this team of inspired minds for coming together this week to review detailed individual action plans for our strategic accounts and also coming together to share our biggest opportunities with each other. We all learn and grow so much together and I LOVE IT! Special shout out to our new BFF, Yuri! Thanks so much for kicking us off, inspiring our thinking, introducing us to the best new yogi 2021, and giving us some insight and vision for the future of WHCE. We're so lucky to have you! Thanks to everyone on the team for contributing to our Periscope project and Data Insights project. We've made some real progress on ass kicking and it's 'only' February! I see you!\n\n67#Workhuman Listens|All,  It’s been such a pleasure to talk to you all over the past weeks, and to hear how much the voice of our customers matters to you! Over the coming months, we will help you create surveys to tap into the wealth of great things our users have to say about our products, how positive their experiences are… how they feel using the platform!! We have distilled the conversations we have had into a roadmap, which we will share with all of you next week. Over the past year, we, the EXM team, have seen some heartwarming testimonials from users, and I have no doubt that we are about to open the floodgates of thanks! I recall about a year ago, when we did our first proper ‘Periscope’ that the resounding response was a 72% ‘Just plain THANK YOU’  and the remaining 28% had some really encouraging and helpful feedback to offer, which we can use to make our product even better!!  All we need to do is listen!  I am excited to start working with you, and encouraged by your enthusiasm for the program.  Let’s build Workhuman listens!    Brian, EXM team\n\n68#Wednesday night Zoom around|Thank you all for such a wonderful time during the zoom around on Wednesday. It was a brilliant way to spend an hour together, and we even had a pre-joiner in our midst. I can't remember who won the facts challenge, we may have to run that back another time!   Thank you for sharing such a fantastic evening together.\n\n69#New Year Goals|Thank you all for providing your feedback on the speakers bureau as we closed out 2020. This recognition is long overdue (holiday brain) but it was extremely helpful to hear your goals for the new year to better understand how the bureau can support upcoming projects with speaking engagements. Whether you walked us through a planning deck, sent notes via email, or participated in an open dialogue - it all helped to shape our ‘21 planning efforts.\n\n70#Delivering the Magic|Rebecca and Amanda, a huge THANK YOU for making an incredible Moment that Matters for the SteerCo at Takeda!  Rebecca, from the moment I called you to tell you what I wanted to do, you had a vision and accelerated the magic.  I love how you just can make such sizzle from a small spark of an idea.  You are masterful and truly brilliant!  Amanda, holy cow, did you ever deliver.  Not only did you make this the easiest task for me, you were making connections globally to pull off an experience that is sure to make the leaders at Takeda very happy.  You hit so many roadblocks along the way and just kept jumping over them and on to the next.  You now could have a career in video editing!  Also, to know that one of the vendors we connected with is reaching out to see if they can be a merchant partner to add even better options in the area is super cool.  Incredible job to both of you.  Thank you for making the magic happen so we can deliver an incredible experience to the team at Takeda!\n\n71#Action Planning our way to 2021|Rebecca, Traci, and Kristen, thanks to each of you for coming together and creating our action plans for Strategic Accounts from a S&C, Cx, and a Marketing perspective. Getting us all singing from the same song sheet is imperative for meeting our Moonshots for 2021. Thank you for diving in especially during the craziest end of year we've ever had. I'm so looking forward to working our plan and to celebrating success. Jill and Alice, thank you for supporting this effort and for your insights!\n\n72#THANKS A \"LATTE\" ☕|The team and I would like to \"espresso\" (Promise last pun 😁) our gratitude for participating in the recent focus group(s)!   Right now, an experience renaissance is afoot – one that is galvanizing companies to push beyond a sea of sameness and find new ways to offer meaningful experiences. Your comprehensive customer insights over the past two weeks will help us TREMENDOUSLY as we move forward in developing + innovating (online learning, e-commerce site, digital matchmaking, etc.) the FY21 events program.  Again, we want to THANK YOU for your time, especially right before the holidays. The team highly values your incredible feedback!\n\n73#Ready for a New Year!|Thanks to this very focused team of experts and leaders for creating something out of the tough 'hand' 2020 dealt us. Through all we've maneuvered through, I've consistently heard nothing but determination, strength, support for each other and for others, and a fierceness to overcome that is burned in my memory forever. As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking. Spending as much time as possible making things happen leaves little time for planning so all the more impressive how thoroughly you prepared to review action plans for each of your accounts. Thanks to our badass team of magicians, Traci and Rebecca for helping me pull off one of our greatest QBRs to date. Cheers to you all and to many more years of success together! You are all the magic of Christmas!\n\n74#2020 WH Holiday Card!|Go team! We did it! Mark - thank you for taking the lead on this complex project. Complex because we had several stakeholders involved to ensure all audiences are taken care of in their own unique way. You and I worked in lock step to ensure we had all the details we needed, shared that info to keep everyone informed, and locked down dates to #gsd on time! Laura, Rachael, Rebecca - thank you for all your invaluable input to make this a success for each of your specific areas! Kevin M. - you found a great charity option with the UN Foundation this year which will build upon our relationship and makes sense given all the great work they do, similarly to Workhuman. Kevin F. - thank you for using your creative genius to add a little extra by animating both the email and zoom backgrounds! Anthony - appreciate all your testing to make sure animations work, setting up 1:1 email templates in a jif and working hard on the versions of the Marketo email with all the segmentation needed! True teamwork across the board on this one!! Happy Holidays to All!!\n\n75#Thanks for your commitment to this journey!|Huge shout out to our esteemed colleagues on the inaugural Experience Task Force team!   Thank you for all of your support, patience, persistence, passion, participation, and continued commitment to the journey we're on together.  We know that the road hasn't always been clear, and perhaps a little bumpy while we've figured out how to navigate, but we've gotten to our first set of priority ideas to tackle for the buyer journey, which is awesome progress.  And choosing ones for the end-user journey is within sight!  You are part of this team because of the perspective you bring to the table while still always having the customer at the center, and we couldn't be more grateful.  This image captures the spirit that this team has - and can't wait to see the fruits and nuts of our labor!  Thank you again for being on this journey and foraging ahead!   (And may you always appreciate our corniness along the way 😉)  Sincerely,  Meghan and Alice\n\n76#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n77#Always thinking, innovating & making us better|Becky & Kristen,   I want to say a BIG THANK YOU!!! for having the vision to see a new way of gathering insights,  AND producing a wildly successful team-building and educational session!  Having members of each of our two teams sign up for a session and gathering the key nuggets from the CustomerX Con to bring back and share with the group was a brilliant idea on multiple levels.  Clearly, no one had the time to attend 5 days worth of sessions, nevermind digest the content.  You set us up for success by allowing us to pick a session that resonated with us as individuals, you then created an AWESOME and easy to use PP template to use to keep us focused on bringing back the top learnings and inspirations, AND lastly made our 1.5-hour team exercise actually be the highlight of  my week (and I'm sure others would agree!)  While our teams work ad-hoc together on projects, when we got together, it really felt like we were one team and we had great synergy.  And the result of everyone's participation produced an efficient, effective, and FUN new way of working.  And you two were the brains behind it all!  Greatly appreciative.\n\n78#A Team Approach to Professional Development|These days we are all under the same time restraints and stresses, but that wasn’t going to stop these rockstar teams from focusing on growth and development!  It was motivating to watch everyone quickly come together to tackle a multi-day, multi-session conference – making it possible to consume hours worth of content in a fraction of the time.  Thank you for thoughtfully recapping your sessions and sharing key findings.  The takeaways and ideas were inspiring and will help expedite the growth of our customer experience and marketing efforts.  And a special shout-out to Becky for organizing the entire process and keeping us on track!\n\n79#Excellence is our Standard|There is nothing I like better than hearing a customer rave about a colleague. Today, on the 7th anniversary of being wow'd by the talent at this company, I was happy to hear one of my very favorite customer's and longtime WH Ambassador's rave about you, Allie! For Nina Reichert to compare thee to the summer day that is Rebecca Rossiter, well, you've made an impression! Nina is a tough grader and she found herself in a swoon talking about your relationship, your work, and your partnership. Rebecca, how great is it to hear that you're still Nina's 'standard'? Thank you both for making customers our #1 fans. YOU ROCK!\n\n80#Creating Creativity|Becky, it is unbelievable to me how you, not only come up with some fabulous ideas for our clients, but you are able to make it so incredible easy for us to move forward with the ideas.  Giving a donation to United Way in IA ,after the storm, for Transamerica was a great project and they were thrilled with receiving it.  The CHRO Kaleidoscope Dinner planning is not only a spectacular idea, but there is no way following up on the process of that could have been made any easier.  You think of EVERYTHING! and you make it bright and shiny.  The champagne that was sent out to the CHRO at Cisco following her participation in WHLO was brilliant and much appreciated.  You are a superwoman and deserved an enormous thank you!  So....THANK YOU!!\n\n81#A huge thanks!|Rebecca wanted to take a quick moment to say thank you (x10!!) for providing your feedback on a customer email last week. We reached out to you for your help and within minutes, you provided such thoughtful feedback and ideas on how we might make the email even more customer centric. Thank you for helping us level up our comms and ensure they're the best they can be for customers!!\n\n82#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n83#Taking Executive Summaries to the NEXT LEVEL!!|WOW! To say this team, ROCKS is an understatement! Thank you all for taking our Executive Summaries to the next level! As part of our Customer Marketing nurture campaign, it's critical to get the value of the program, why it matters, the impact it has on employees, how it aligns to business goals, outcomes and what's next in front of our most senior customer audiences this time of the year when critical program budgeting is happening.   Rebecca, my partner in crime, your guidance on vision and strategy for our Executive Summaries 2.0 and ways to innovate the template to take it to 10.0 in innovation was superb! Then you doubled-down in a very hands on way to customize the templates and pull in data for our Top 32 accounts. No easy task and without your help our deadlines would have been missed. Plus, of course, you organized it all in Sharepoint for easy reference, edits and execution by all. Michelle, your willingness to jump on a call quickly, understand the data points needed, provide some guidance, and assign the tasks to your team and setting expectations on delivery and EXCEED the timelines, was much appreciated.   Noah, Clarice, Alisa, Rachel K, Rachel R and Daniel, without you pulling all of the necessary data points, verifying the data, populating each customer template and acting with a sense of urgency, our campaign wouldn't have gone off in conjunction with World Gratitude Day! Thank you for all you did to deliver all templates, early! In the spirit of WGD and being super GRATEFUL for all of you - as the quote on this recognition moment says \"We are not a team because we work together. We are a team because we respect, trust and CARE for each other! Thank you for making me, our other colleagues and Workhuman successful by going ALL IN and supporting our customer marketing, executive relationships and investment nuture campaign efforts. YOU ROCK!!!!\n\n84#Masterful planning|We don’t often work together, but I have to say it’s been “eventful” so far! Being a part of this team who are dreaming up new ways to create classy and engaging experiences while keeping it all virtual of course! You’ve been very thoughtful ensuring you have the right program name, messaging, cadence, budget, timing, gifts, topics, and speakers. Great job thinking through all of these aspects on multiple events/series and working on things that are outside the box! People are eager to connect and take part in the topics you’re going to deliver. Way to make Workhuman a connection point for C-Level audiences. Can’t wait to hear how they go as they start rolling out!\n\n85#Hi, My name is Becky and I live Workhuman!|Becky, HUGE thank you for being brilliant, smart, and courageous... for being you!  Over the last couple weeks, you have risen to the occasion time and time again!  Your Moonshot idea for executive dinners was spot on to facilitate a curated experience and deliver \"The Workhuman Experience\" in a fun and Workhuman way!  Aligning with the Jeffersonian format, grabbing the reins from an experience perspective and pulling together an inspiring pitch with intent and positivity!  Yay!  Your PM skills are still so sharp, and I love that you thought through the whole project leaving no stone unturned!  I cannot wait to see the next phase come to fruition!  From a moments perspective we were struggling to articulate the framework in a way that would resonate with everyone across the organization using my super-creative words systematized, repeatable and one off (blah blah blah) then you came up with a simple way to leverage terminology everyone can relate to – off the shelf, made to order and bespoke/unique – and hey presto now we have it!  Thank you for your brilliance and thank you for stepping up and co-presenting with me today at the Exec meeting, sharing the framework, progress, and highlights of human moments that we have delivered!  You did an awesome job and I am beyond proud of you and so grateful to have you on our Experience team!  Hooray to you Becky!  Keep being awesome!  Thank you!  I appreciate you! …and P.S. I need more Isla pics flowing to me on a regular basis as they provide me with a human moment that matters every time I see one!\n\n86#Fire Starter|Rebecca, I could not go another second in the day without calling out your incredibly insightful presentation at our ZoomBRs yesterday. Talk about a moonshot...woah. First of all, you set a framework for delivering Moments (registered trademark) that was so simple in it's brilliance, we were absolutely gobsmacked. The team very easily snapping into the movie/vision that you were able to so eloquently articulate. And if that wasn't enough, you quickly followed by setting up a Moonshot that once brought to life will deliver for the business on so many levels...I could barely catch my breath. You have such a gift for seeing around the bend and for meeting people where they are and for delivering in a way that always ENHANCES our relationships with customers. INCREDIBLE! I'm so excited for all of our opportunities in the 2H and beyond and a lot of the excitement stems from the vision you create that is so supportive of our customer strategies. THANK YOU and BRAVA!\n\n87#Creating Moments that Matter|Team, I wanted to thank you for your help as we try to create a more human experience within the Here to Help pilot.  We have had a great response to the pilot and now we are going to bring our Customers the faces and people behind the support.  I cannot thank you enough for your ideas, creativity and support to help us pull this together. I truly feel this be blow our Customers away and bring them closure to Workhuman as a valued partner.  I cannot wait for what's to come next!\n\n88#Sales Bootcamp Theme & Swag|Alice, Meghan, Amanda, Chris, Genessa, Jillian, Laury & Rebecca - thank you very much for the support in the planning of sales bootcamp. This team has helped with theme development, great shirts and video's that have helped get us off to a great start this week! Thank you for the teamwork.\n\n89#A template is worth a thousand words (or more!)|Thank you, Becky, for orchestrating an important, beautiful vehicle to create moments for customers, future-customers and partners that LOOKS and FEELS like our product! Taking the time to produce and systematize assets like these will not only save time to create a moment in a pinch, but can also be used in so many ways to spread joy and cheer across the globe - all while reminding the recipient of the Workhuman way. I got to see these beauties in action recently and WOW, I am impressed and delighted! You are always so organized and thoughtful in your approach to any project you take on, and that is incredibly evident in these beautiful templates. Thank you for putting your Innovation/Imagination/Determination hat on to enable multiple teams to create magical moments as often as possible!\n\n90#Focused on Moonshots--Pandemic be DAMNED|Traci and Rebecca, thank you so much for your leadership on our big moonshot to elevate our executive relationships at our Strategic Accounts! In under a week, you not only delivered on creating a resource center to support the team, but you thought of every detail! From an overarching playbook, easy-to-create gorgeous agendas, content tracks, internal and external speaker ideas, to great historical examples of actual executive summits---you nailed it! If that weren't enough, you're already adding to the arsenal with a full set of 'experiential techniques and engagement ideas' to be sure we've thought through the actual experience we're going to create. I could not be prouder to work with the two of yous! You are your own cosmic universe--we're just happy to be in the orbit! Rocketship to the Moon! T3! Bravo!!\n\n91#Thank You Healthcare Images - Weekend Worriors|Thank you all for jumping in to take part in the logo and image sourcing and uploading for hospitals into the Thank You Healthcare site!  Ensuring that the experience is personal and meaningful for those who access the site is incredibly important and your help in making this happen was invaluable! I got to see first-hand your passion, collaboration and sheer energy brought to this exciting task!  You gave up time over your Easter weekend with family to dedicate energy toward this grand human cause.  Adam, Becky and Meghan, thank you for leading the cross functional team from activating help from across the company, providing detailed instructions (that even I could follow), guidance, direction, answering questions and providing top tips and learnings throughout the process, even participating as heavy hitters in the uploading and sourcing as well! When I asked you, Becky and Meg, to help partner with Adam and the technology team to make this happen you were so excited to be a part of this phenomenal project and your pride was palpable- thank you!  You guys have become the 3 amigos!  Superb effort, and excellent management, your incredible knowledge and attention to detail has been awe-inspiring! Thank you also to each of you who dedicated an hour, several hours and in some cases most of the weekend to sourcing and uploading!  We so appreciate your efforts!  Many hands make light work, my mother used to say! I do want to call out a few of you who really made an incredible dent in the project uploading and sourcing between 70 and 230 images each and in many cases hitting both uploading and sourcing!  WOW!  Brian Moore, Matt Durgin, John Wamback, Jon Bizeur, Amanda Salvas, Rich Sorrentino, Jillian Gregoriou and Dan Fiore, you guys are complete rock stars and your contributions were mammoth! This was a true team effort and to see it in action makes me so proud to be a part of our Workhuman family!  Amazing job! Let’s share some gratitude with the world now!\n\n92#CREATING A WAVE of GRATITUDE|Can you feel it? It's a soul lifting, soaking you to the bone, crashing wave of gratitude and joy that is emanating from this group of people. There are SO many ways this team of people is banding together, ideating, taking action, sharing, and LIFTING our customers (and each other) in this incredible hectic time! I just want to take a moment to say thank you for working through this time of uncertainty with your hearts on your sleeve. For reaching out to customers and giving them strength and light and the power to do good. If there was ever a team meant for the right now, it's this team. Thank you from leading from each of your seats and for creating incredible opportunities on a daily basis for our customers, for our brand, and for our business! You're ALL HEART and I'm loving it!!!\n\n93#\"Celebrating\" Life Events at Takeda|This team truly exemplified the meaning of \"Respect for Urgency\" when a very last minute request came through from Takeda.  A great partner to us at Workhuman, Alexis Kyriakou, is leaving Takeda and when his team reached out to ask if we could help showcase a Life Events experience, I immediately said YES!  This team came together so quickly to help make this experience incredible for Alexis and his team. It was the first time for me working with many of you and I have to say, what an amazing group of humans.  Everyone came to the table with positivity and a \"we can do this\" attitude from moment one.  You never even faltered when we moved the timeline up significantly. Thank you from both myself and a special request from Matt Ragheb, Program Owner at Takeda too.  We both feel beyond thankful and I got many accolades from the other contributors along the way telling us how much they appreciated us doing this on their behalf.  A special Elaine from Seinfeld dance from me in honor of all your hard work.  Woohoo!\n\n94#And Thank YOU, team!|I wanted to recognize you all for being a part of the amazing Healthcare Thank you Video we launched to our customers and social channels yesterday afternoon. This was both a great initiative to showcase our respect for our customers and all members in the healthcare industry, as well as such a great team collaboration. Each and every one of you played a crucial part in making this so successful.   I was personally excited and touched by this video since I have so many family members and close friends in the front lines, and I'm so excited to share with them to brighten their day!\n\n95#The many hats of boss-lady, therapist and friend|Becky - this recognition is long overdue, dating back to the moment you returned from maternity leave and jumping back in head-first! I want to thank you for all you do to support me at work and in life. You consistently listen, provide supportive feedback, share ideas, comfort me in my crazy, bring a positive outlook to each interaction, lift me up (and bring me back to Earth when I need it), you're flexible and are always willing to pitch in on a project.   These last few days have been especially challenging, and I want to make sure you know how much I appreciate you for the wonderful human that you are. You let me bring my whole self to work, even when there are tears, and share a great outlook that helps me shift my perspective. I also appreciate that you can always make me laugh to break up the stress! Mental health is so important, and you have been a rock for mine.  THANK YOU, from the bottom of my heart (and whole soul).\n\n96#Creating Magic|Becky, I want you to know how much I appreciate your resilience and determination.  This week has brought new challenges with family dynamics and you have persevered and been determined in continuing to create your special brand of magic!  Thank you for jumping in to help with the Healthcare video participation and being a source of positivity and support throughout the week!  Thank you also for coming up with the amazing moment for our Exec team offsite last week - it seems like a lifetime ago - you imagined a moment that was truly impactful and beautiful and it made a tremendous impact in setting the tone for living what we preach, our theme for the offsite.  Thank you!  I appreciate you!\n\n97#You Live Workhuman!|Becky, thank you so very much for all you are doing every day to live the Workhuman Experience!  Since you got back just a few short weeks ago, you have made such a positive impact!  I, and the entire team are delighted to have you back!  You have not skipped a beat and in fact you have dived right in to take on more responsibility, add more value and create moments that matter every day – do you do it in your sleep as well?  Do you dream in moments now??? HAHAHA!!! I love it!  It is no surprise to you I am sure, how much I appreciate you and I don’t only appreciate you today, on Employee Appreciation Day, but I appreciate you every single day!  I feel so fortunate to have you on my team and I am delighted you are back with us in time to take on Workhuman Live from an experience perspective!  Thank you, Becky, I love you to bits and can’t wait to see what you will do in 2020 with your Moonshot thinking!  I appreciate you!\n\n98#Shoutout to all my Saucy Aunts|Thank you all so much for bringing great energy, enthusiasm, and attention to the kickoff with Influitive! This was a true cross-functional effort with representation from CX, CS, Strategy and Consulting, Marketing, Sales Operations, and Design – an awesome demonstration of the power of collaboration. As we heard, even our Influitive consultant was impressed with how much involvement we had. You all brought unique perspectives on how we can engage with and deliver value to our customers through this community platform. I’m still riding the wave of excitement coming from our kickoff and am so excited to engage with each of you further in executing on the strategy we developed together. And not only were we productive, but we got to have some fun in there too ?. I’m so grateful to work alongside each and every one of you. Looking forward to the amazing things to come!\n\n99#Full Speed Ahead|#weworkhuman #shootthemoon #theinstitute  What a revitalizing day and a half! Thank you to this team of great big thinkers and risk takers for a deeply challenging few days of daring to reach for BIG ideas and creative paths to accomplish our mission. It was a great way to kick off our “project” for 2020. I believe this team, in this partnership, can achieve new heights. Thank you for giving yourself to this with your whole self! Cheers to the Dream State! Special shouts to Becky, Traci, and Jill for helping nail down our process and making sure we paused to drink and eat!!!\n\n100#Best Team Ever!|Team awesome,  I am so fortunate to call you amazing humans “my team”.  We are a wonderful collection of unique humans complimenting each other so well!  Thank you for all pulling together to arrange a fabulous Experience workshop Exec session on short notice!  Meghan your leadership on this one was top notch!  This is just one example of each of you displaying your team spirit, collaborative approach, out of the box thinking and extreme attention to detail!  You guys are amazing, and I love you all so much!  I am the most fortunate individual in the world that I get to work with you all each day!  Thank you for your support, passion, commitment and for not being afraid to challenge me and one another respectfully using radical candor to ensure we always find the best solutions and the win-win in any situation!  I hope you know how much I value each of you!  Thank you!\n\n101#Bay Area Women in HR Event Success|So well done kicking off what I hope will be a series of WH hosted 'Women in HR' events in our local customer hubs! We had such a great night with some incredibly talented women. Lots of great feedback on bringing this community together and lots of energy for repeating this type of event and building community amongst HR leaders. Thank you for standing this event up quickly with very few resources and knocking it out of the park! Bravo!\n\n102#Super Hero Is Your Middle Name|Who runs the world?! Girls! Just one girl. One girl specifically. And her name is Rebecca Rossiter. Getting things done is your superpower, Becky! You’re determined, tenacious, passionate, and decisive. Every initiative you join, you make better. Every project you lead you crush. Thank you so, so, so much for selflessly spearheading Eva’s fifteen-year partnership celebration. And thank you for your hard work helping to develop and launch WH’s inaugural Women in Leadership networking event in the Bay Area.  I’m excited to see the impactful connections made between our top clients by creating a space where they can come together to share ideas, learn from each other’s successes, and share opportunities! When Eileen shared that she tapped you to help plan the event, I knew it would be incredible - because I trust everything you do to be on the main stage at Coachella. Who is she? What does she run? She runs the world.\n\n103#Turning an amazing idea into a meaningful moment!|We knew we came to the right place when we reached out to the two of you for help to create a memorable moment for Merck's CHRO's first anniversary.  Since it's only been one year and our interactions with the CHRO have been scarce thus far, we were struggling with an idea to mark this important milestone with a gift that would be meaningful to him and serve as a touchpoint from the Workhuman team that we are grateful for our partnership with Merck, and for him!  Your amazing idea was to create a framed infographic style timeline with the many amazing milestone's of their Inspire program and marking the moment that Steve became part of this amazing journey of their Inspire program, just a year ago.  You collaborated with all of the internal teams, CS, S&C, creative etc., dealt with getting it proofed, printed, framed, and delivered with a hand-written note (Amanda, I'm thankful your handwriting is better then mine!!) just in time for his anniversary.  Thank you for your great idea, impeccable execution and the urgency that you put behind this meaningful moment!\n\n104#Inspired Offsite|Thanks to this group of dreamy strategic thinkers for coming together to talk about the future! It’s a big ask to set a whole day aside and spend every minute challenging yourself to see bigger and write the future. With the fantastic support and creative talents of Amanda and Melissa, we were really able to have some inspired conversations and start to imagine how we can move our business closer and closer to the Dream State. Special shout out to our personal energizer, Traci P for keeping it fun and physical! Rebecca, you are an incredible partner to our team—-thank you for your incredible work to get us organized and planning forward! Cheers!\n\n105#Best boss-lady, even better person!|Where do I begin? There are so many reasons to thank you, so I guess I will start with the incredible leadership and advice you give on a regular basis! With so much going on you still consistently make me (and Jillian) your priority every day and for every project. Most recently you have given insights on customer milestones, trusted me to take on bigger initiatives and given great direction on our plans for CX day, making sure that we are thinking about the right things and that we think them ALL the way through. You set the bar high and challenge the thought process to be sure things make sense, and that no stone is left unturned. I am always learning from you and strive to have the magnificent brain-power you showcase every day (including today!). Thank you for keeping quality top-of-mind and for making sure that we do the same. I am so grateful for you, Becky! It is an honor to work with you.\n\n106#SHAREPOINT POSSIBILITIES|Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I can not thank you three enough for sitting with me the last few days to go over some of the things you are working on with Sharepoint and how to make it a better user experience.  The things you have been able to do from a look and feel, as well as organizational perspective, was really eye opening.   Thank you for taking the time to walk me through what your goals were, then understanding mine, and then showing me the tactical of how to actually do something with it.  As we said, its just the beginning, and I thank you for all your help so far!  Cheers!\n\n107#Getting the Job Done and Done Well!|Becky, I want to call out your phenomenal ability to be action orientated as a daily practice!  You not only get things done fast, but you do it with passion, energy, excitement and great attention to detail, delivering a quality outcome!  Well done!  I can reference so many examples across both strategic projects as well as moments projects such as the Acceleration Plan, Human Insights, A Human Welcome and now Congratulations on working Human to name a few!  Becky, I can’t tell you how comforting it feels when I know that you are involved in a project.  Thank you for your can-do attitude, sense of urgency and dedication to delivering exceptional customer experiences!  Thank you!  I am grateful for you today and every day!\n\n108#Q3 Acceleration|Thanks to this team for another outstanding Acceleration Project quarterly mind meld. Every quarter we come together representing the expertise and perspective of many areas of the business. This quarter was special as we've 'accelerated' our thinking and really got the team thinking bigger and making connections and recommendations. This commitment and intense work for our top 5 customers is paying off as we have come away with a laundry list of opportunities and ideas to grow and protect the business. Thank you for your teamwork, intense listening skills, and outstanding impactful insights!!!\n\n109#The Percussion Section is on FIRE|Thanks to each of you for bringing your 'best beats' to Bootcamp! Every great band needs a percussion section that can offer confidence, a solid framework, and some sick solos. Each of you came to play in Newport! Thank you for sharing your success with our most significant customers, your confidence in our market leadership, and your learnings along the way. Not only did you share with the broader sales organization but also in our team meetings throughout the week.  It's always tough to get through our QBR session, even when we have twice the time, so this time was especially impactful as you shared your work and opportunities. Especially thankful for our teammates who are bringing the pain with some incredible marketing ideas and experience projects that should elevate our ability to play into our Mick Jagger years! Cheers!\n\n110#Coming together is the beginning!|I wanted to thank you all for your contribution and collaboration these past few months on a couple of key initiatives - WH Enterprise Certification, WH Learning Academy and WH Professional Certification. These initiatives will be a game changer for us as we look to unfold them in the next few months. You all have played such critical role in the analysis of the current state and shaping the design of the future state as part of the Project team or as part of the Center of Excellence team. It has been a great experience partnering with each of you as you bring this quote to life for me - \"Alone we can do so little ; together we can do so much\" Helen Keller. Thank you!\n\n111#Customer Video Excellence|The odyssey of customer testimonial video capture starts months before Workhuman Live. When choosing a value for this award, I could have selected all of them. But the bullish imagination and determination that went into the final deliverable is commendable. Amanda – amazing work setting the strategic goals, working closely with Becky on determining the best customers to interview in Nashville. Becky – thanks so much for your diligent ambassador work, laying the groundwork for relationship building and trust. And Kristen – thanks for your contributions onsite, providing support during the shoots. And then the challenging work picked up! James and Matt – thanks for pushing the boundaries on how we could improve the videos from previous versions. Through it all, Amanda – you stayed on course, working closely with James and Matt to deliver these – overcoming obstacles (who knew lipstick was a four-letter word) to get these to the place where we could bring them to market and into our sales reps’ hands. And it’s not just my applause you are hearing. When the CHRO of Symantec posts a thank you on LinkedIn, that is impressive. Amazing work. It was great to watch this team in action. Thank you.\n\n112#Living the values!|Today I had the pleasure of running a training design workshop with a highly talented group of humans...and they didn't let me down.  The ideas generated today were fantastic and are helping to shape the design of a new values-based workshop, incorporating the thinking in moments work, which will touch every one of our humans.  Many thanks to Alice, Jillian, Meghan, Rebecca, Amanda, Colleen, Kristen, Paul, for giving up your time today and sharing your collective brain power! It was truly impressive to see Respect for Teamwork in action!\n\n113#Sharing the love|Thank you ladies so much for your help in planning a very special surprise for Alice's 15th celebration! From putting together the PowerPoint presentation and getting the cake and making sure all the right people were involved, you pulled together a great turn out in just a few days! I know Alice would second how awesome it is to work with you all and your willingness to help in any way with smiles on your face! Thanks again!\n\n114#Not just a Microsite|As I was typing up this recognition, I received an email from their Global CHRO (Olivier) who responded to my post event email to all attendees that included the link to the microsite we had built. Karine (his SVP or Rewards and Decision Maker on our partnership) was copied. He not only expressed his thanks for a great day, he also included an open (eager) invitation to be their advisor on how they can improve their recognition culture! BRAVO Team for an amazingly executed plan leading to the exact response we were hoping for! Rebecca - thank you for being the very first to take my initial request and elevating it to the next level! You could have easily told me I'm crazy to think we could pull off such a custom request on such short notice but instead took over and rallied the teams to go all the way with a microsite and a custom cover for the iPad. Amanda - You are such a delight to work with even under pressure. We had but 3 days to get that custom cover with their logo ordered to arrive on time for us to present it to Schneider. Jay, Lauren, Anthony and Mike - thank you for expeditiously building the site, pulling in the content we wanted (which involved getting approvals too!) and for your patience and professionalism when responding to last minute requests to add personal videos too! This wasn't just a microsite. It is a powerful seed that has now formed sturdy roots that will undoubtedly grow into a strong magnanimous tree! THANK YOU to all of you who made this moment possible!!\n\n115#Strategic Experience Mapping Workshops|A big thanks to all of you for coming to the Experience Mapping Workshops ready to share ideas of how we can use WH to help achieve our company goals. It was fantastic to see how aligned everyone is! Your time and dedication will help create the best WH yet with carefully curated experiences that will inspire all attendees and customers. Great job everyone.\n\n116#Inspiring Greatness|Thank you to this incredible team of strategists for an impressive two (very) long days of concentrated best practice sharing, ideation, mind blowing progress on our dream state goals, and overall pure stamina. I was reminded again these last solid 48 hours exactly how much work you are doing and magic you are making at our most strategic customers. It is truly mind blowing what we can do as a team to impact the business. Thank you for your teamwork, your commitment to make the best of our time together, for helping to find the humor in some tough situations, and for being downright badass leaders. Each of you brought a perspective to our two day marathon that helped someone move an idea or a strategy forward. Each of you contributed your unique voice. Together, you make up the greatest team I’ve been privileged to work with. Onward to victory! Bravo!\n\n117#Thank you for the support!|Thanks Rebecca for all the help with my recent day of meetings in Framingham. You took the time in meeting with me first thing, walking me through your role and that of your team, and further helped in touring me through the office, the various depts, and how they interact with each other as I am getting oriented to the organization. Particularly helpful was connecting me with meetings in different parts of the office throughout the day, and introducing me to people along the way. Thank you very much, I appreciate it!!\n\n118#Of Humans That Rock|Rebecca this award is long overdue and it’s from all of us SCDs! How many times have you heard us say “Where have you been all my life?” That’s because you truly make a difference every day, in every interaction we have with you. You always come to the table ready to tackle anything we put in front of you. You’re thoughtful in your approach because you always have the big picture, strategic goals and business outcomes in mind. The word impossible is not in your vocabulary and you have the creative genius to will ideas to life with fierce determination. You’re such a delight to partner with and you inspire all of us with your energy and enthusiasm. Meetings with you are always highly productive because we don’t have to spend time explaining to you why something is important even though at surface level it might seem like a small insignificant act. This is because, to top it all off, you understand the power of human relationships and work to ensure that the experience is personal and meaningful. You just get it. Most recently, your Herculean effort at WorkHuman is just beyond anything we expected. You knew that it was important for us to be organized and focused on creating personal moments with the many executives that joined us this year and without prompting consolidated all the important pieces that we needed to give priority to. You tirelessly worked to ensure they felt special and dreamt up opportunities for us to do so seamlessly. I cannot even begin to tell you what an impact that has made! From all of us to you, thank you for being you!\n\n119#Ambassador Breakfast a \"Hit\"!|Hi Rebecca, I wanted to let you know how successful I thought the Ambassador breakfasts were....specifically because of your efforts.  With all the different initiatives leading up to the event you were still able to coordinate a successful program with our prospects and elect customers for breakfast on Wed and Thursday mornings.   I have heard nothing but great things as a result.  Careful, you may have just signed up for a much bigger Ambassador initiative next year!  Thanks again.\n\n120#Customers First|We have the luckiest customers in the world thanks to you three. You are all so passionate about every moment they experience at Workhuman to ensure their loyalty and ambassadorship. Amanda, it was so much fun working on this year’s customer lounge and seeing your out your own unique stamp on it. Becky, Customer Connect and the customer demos were such smart additions to this year’s show. And Alice, you really brought the message of the WC Cloud home for all customers at the Wildhorse this year. I can’t wait to start on next year and hear all of the great new ideas you are cooking up for the customers. Again, they are fortunate to have this team who has their back every step of the way.\n\n121#Home is where the heart is|Alice, Becky, & Amanda - I want to thank you for taking the time to start integrating me into the Customer Experience team during the crazy few weeks leading up to WH. Tasking me with two major projects for the event was the break I'd been waiting for! Both the Customer Look Book and building out the customer demo sites were challenging and fun. It meant the world that you were trusting me with such important projects. You provided thoughtful feedback during my completion, which allowed me to execute them and deliver quality final products I was proud of. On top of that, being able to attend and witness the phenomenal experience you planned for our customers in Nashville was overwhelming. Your attention to detail did not go unnoticed. I cannot wait to be immersed in the deeper vision for next years event. Customer experience is the home I've been looking for! The passion you ladies have is unmatched. Looking ahead, knowing you all are in my corner, I think we can reach new heights as the small and mighty team we are!\n\n122#Grateful for YOU|Have I told you lately that I love you... or that I am grateful for you? Well, I am. You are the rock solid foundation that I lean on when anything goes awry - AND when it goes right. You are the first person I look to for clarification, information, help, praise and guidance. You are always there when I need you and I am so thankful for that (+belly laughs to break up the madness). Not only are you a wealth of information, but you are also physically down in the trenches with me getting all of the \"things\" done - raffles, shipping, distribution - you name it. I am grateful to have you as my partner, mentor and more importantly, my friend. I honestly couldn't have made it through this Workhuman Live without you, Becky!\n\n123#Thanks for all you do!|Becky, the SCD team would like to extend a big thank you for all of your outstanding efforts to bring amazing events to life at Workhuman for our customers.  You were a huge help in many aspects of the customer experience and truly our lifeline when it came to planning and successfully executing the Cy Luncheon.  We came to you with our ideas and when things got really busy, you took the bull by the horns and were determined to \"get 'er done!\"  From securing space to organizing the agenda, creating the invitation, communicating with Cy's team, planning lunch, decorations, acquiring gifts for the attendees, and the list goes on.  You are a huge help to our team and we appreciate all that you do!\n\n124#Customer Connections|Rebecca - Thank you so much for all of your partnership leading up to Workhuman. The work you did building out our ambassador network was HUGE for our team in securing opportunities to capture customer stories in different ways at the event. Your approach was smart, and gave us the information we needed to be more strategic in our planning and execution. Kristen - I am so grateful to have you on the marketing team. You checked in with me regularly before the event to make sure we were on the same page, and offered your insight and support along the way. Thanks for joining me onsite for a few interviews, it was great to have another perspective! I feel very lucky to have collaborative colleagues like you!\n\n125#A Step Ahead...ALWAYS!|Becky, I cannot thank you enough for your enormous contribution to making the customer events at Workhuman a raving success!  You were directly responsible for making the Customer Connect come to life and wow what an amazing success that was!  The most successful connection of customers and future customers to date with rave reviews from both Ambassadors participating on our behalf as well as future customers - they connected, made friends and have solidified strong relationships through this format – great job!  Customer Demo was your idea starting with your \"let’s do it like crispy cream does when fresh donuts come out the lights go on - we can have the lights go on when customers are demoing their sites\"!  Well we did not incorporate the donuts and the lights, but we did have the demos, and this too was a huge success - we learned from day one having fewer attendees and drove huge attendance day two!  Great real-time adjustments to drive greater success.  Thank you!  Your creativity is fabulous, and I love all your ideas, the crazy, the insightful, the process efficiencies and the just plain “out of the box” brilliance! You took on being the main contact managing the Ambassadors to maximize their impact on-site this year and this was another success!  All the items that you were not directly involved with you supported wholeheartedly. Most of all I truly appreciated your support throughout the real-time adjustments we made in the weeks leading up to Workhuman and on-site!  Becky, being able to count on you to get on and make things happen as well as for the support you provide to me personally in addition to realizing the CX vision is a gift that I am truly grateful for.  Thank you for being a critical part of making Workhuman Live a great success for our customers!  I appreciate you!\n\n126#Our Team Rocks!|Becky and Amanda – I can not share just how grateful I am for our amazing small but mighty team!  You two have been remarkable in your sheer determination to deliver the very best experience for our customers at Workhuman Live!  You guys have risen to the challenge in spades and I have no idea what I would have done without you both partnering on every single detail!  We have divided and conquered, and I am beyond excited by what lies in wait for us in Nashville!  Thank you for being the best teammates ever!!!  I appreciate you both more than you will ever know, and I could not be happier that we are a team!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  Let’s go have some fun and move that needle!!!!\n\n127#Box? What box?|Rebecca, this recognition is overdue and our last 1:1 reminded me just how much.  Your energy and imagination in brining the customer experience to life these past few months has been amazing.  Between customer experiences at WH Live and the acceleration plans, your ideas are taking life and making the company better.  I just wanted to let you know how grateful I am that you're on our team.  Great work!\n\n128#Acceleration Kickoff Team|A big thank you and much gratitude to the entire team involved in kicking off our global internal 'review' of our top 5 customers! It took many hours of prep to do the research, thinking, and reporting for each of your areas of expertise AND then several more hours to come together as a team and review all of the great insights.  Thank you for digging in, thinking BIG, and committing yourselves to this important effort. One more review meeting to go! With every call we've made some connections, identified some opportunities, and put ourselves in a better place strategically.  Great work!\n\n129#Fast, Accurate, Inspiring Hands|For all of you lasered focused on all of the varied communications going out to our customers, THANK YOU! It's a race to Nashville and I am SO happy to have you all on our team! Lots of details and first impressions to be made and you are all making every effort to knock them out of the park.  YOU ROCK!\n\n130#Dream State|Excellent work preparing thoughtful action plans that map our work toward the dream state with all of our strategic customers. What an excellent QBR session! I challenged you all to think big and you blew me away. It’s hard to believe how much we discussed, developed, and dreamt up in just one day! It was possible because you all put the work in ahead of time. Having Rebecca and Traci join us and start to immediately aligning with our work was the icing on our Valentine cake! Well done all! Really proud to work with each of you!\n\n131#A ride out of the desert|Thanks to you both for your great partnership this week (and always) on a multitude of projects. Sometimes it feels like I need a ride out of the vast desert and the two of you always happen to be driving through with the radio on and the rose colored sunglasses ready. Means a lot to have partners who are honest, direct, and all about the action.  Thanks!\n\n132#Prep makes perfect!|Anne Marie and Rebecca - thank you both so much for your diligent planning and wrangling to get everyone on the same page for our joint Marketing/Revenue alignment meeting. I know a lot went on in the background that most of us will never see, and that this is exactly what contributes to a well-planned, productive session. I can speak for the Marketing team in saying that we left feeling that our time was productive, well-spent, and also understanding where we needed to focus and clarify. A great start! Well done!\n\n133#Historical Dig|THANK you to this team of rockstars for pulling together 12+ years of historical insights for 3 major customers for our 1% project.  We expected to have this call with only a few days notice and when I reached out for help, you guys threw yourselves at it. I know how incredibly tough this timing must have been for you given our nearly full week away, jet lag, and work piling up. Not only did you deliver but you delivered excellence.  It makes sense that you were all so deeply involved in these accounts and their success to begin with! You ROCK!\n\n134#Herding the cats|Anne Marie and Rebecca, thanks so much for your diligent efforts in helping coordinate the format, timing, logistics and quality assurance elements for the upcoming Marketing/Customer Strategy alignment session.  Your hard work and focus on detail will set us up nicely to maximize value from the day and ultimately result in #oneteam moving customers along their journey to WorkHuman.  Well done!\n\n135#Drowning in Data!|Thank you, Becky, for being so thorough in your approach to evaluating the customer survey data!  You have been digging in for days to ensure no stone was left unturned!  Thank you for your tremendous efforts and I am excited to see the results tomorrow as you enter the final stages working with Jesse and team to share the findings!  Exciting times and wonderful initial findings!  Thank you for taking control of this analysis!  Awesome and incredibly important work!\n\n136#Little MEANINGFUL Things - BIG Difference!!!|Little things, coming from THOUGHTFUL and IMAGINATIVE people, make a BIG difference! Alice and Rebecca, your work in creating the best customer experience possible and turning our customers into - our family members, our biggest champions, biggest advocates and evangelists for social recognition and performance management - is paying off in spades! Your idea to send Jennifer Sweda a personalized, thoughtful, meaningful card to Congratulate her on her new job at Progressive Insurance and let her know we were all thinking of her was a memorable moment and an act of kindness that she'll never forget. The GF/Eaton core project team signed the card and Rebecca you made this an even more inclusive experience by having the Customer Transformation committee members who knows Jennifer quite well sign too. So many heartfelt messages, notes and well wishes were sent her way in that card.  Today, she send an email saying what this meant to her - 'I got the card yesterday. Thank you!! I thought it was going to be a “Season’s Greetings” card. I can honestly say I was incredibly surprised and touched. I even got a little teary eyed. Please convey my thanks to everyone. I miss you all and will hopefully see you in Nashville. I think you are working with the Clinic now and I’ve been talking you up to UH too which are all on this side of town.' These little Memorable Moments will always stick with our Globofamily members. Creating meaningful, memorable, fun, unusual and unexpected experiences influence the way customers perceive Globoforce and how they feel about us. These little details are so easy to overlook if there isn't someone really paying attention to them. Thank you for thinking BIG, thinking outside the box, creating memorable moments for others and ultimately adding crusaders to our WorkHuman movement because they know what living a life with appreciation, gratitude and recognition feels like everyday. Thank you, thank you!!  You both ROCK!!!!\n\n137#Peanut Butter & Jelly!|Becky, I want to thank you for your partnership. We have had to forge a path through our own storm this year and I am so proud of us!  We seem to have come out the other side with bells on!  The last few weeks working together feels like the old days and with increased focus, respect, dedication and purpose!  I am so happy about that!  Thank you for being the jelly to my peanut butter sandwich!   ?  You are doing a phenomenal job driving the detailed cross functional collaboration on the journey mapping project, supporting me on the NPS project, helping move forward many aspects of WorkHuman 2019 and doing amazing work on the acceleration project!  I feel fortunate to be able to work with you and support you on these projects with sometimes great involvement and others as simply being a supportive ear encouraging you and letting you just get on with it!  You were so supportive of me throughout the strategic brainstorm planning!  When I needed to run my plans, ideas and approaches past someone, you were always there to battle test ideas and share your opinions with me!  Every morning for a period of time I would call you on the way in to run my ideas by you from the night before, each time you were so supportive and collaborative, encouraging me and showing your support!  Most of all I love the faith that you placed in me throughout the process and the attention to detail in the final days preparing the on-site experience!  Thank you Becky!  I am so excited about what we can deliver in 2019!  I appreciate you!!  We make a great pair- just like peanut butter and jelly! :-)\n\n138#Yes - there is always one...!|Thank you to the phenomenal “Transformation Chargers”! What a phenomenal and inspiring kick off team gathering we had today. I am beyond excited by all the great ideas that we generated to positively shape our customer experience as we drive to systematically deliver advocates across our customer base - impacting both those who know they are customers and those that are our future customers. The brainstorm sessions were so powerful!  Insights were sparked, we tripped over our truth, identified moments of pride, and discussed moments of elevation.  All the great contributions made were truly inspiring and potentially transformative for our customer experience!   I look forward to the impact that we are going to make as we start to deliver on these great ideas.  We definitely had some a-ha moments along the way.  Thank you all for bringing your whole self to the meeting!  Thank you for your passion, excitement, engagement and contribution and for committing to be a part of this exciting team moving forward!   I look forward to working with each of you thank you for making today great!\n\n139#Navigator|Wow - the first cross the pond journey map session completed - sheer excellent facilitation Becky, you brought the best out though direction, sharing stories & knowledge. No way we would have walked out with what we got if you had not steered early on on the addition of the new persona! Thank you, think we have a great Pilot- Navigator duo!\n\n140#Are you from the Future?|Rebecca- Time and time again, I am absolutely blown away with your ability to see the future and make plans for us all to meet you there! Another incredible example of your visionary abilities is your idea to ACCELERATE our business with our top 5 customers (to start) by bringing SMEs from all over the business together to do a deep dive on each customer's health, opportunities, and leverage points.  You not only put an incredibly detailed plan of attack together but then reached out to every corner of the business with a stake in the success of our customers and excited them about this plan.  You single handedly recruited an incredible team of people to come together and pilot a holistic internal review of our largest customers AND then, you lead multiple meetings to review their initial findings, get their feedback on process and insights, and synthesize their contributions.  While we are in early stages of this pilot, I know for a fact it is going to significantly improve the way we develop and harness our internal tools and talents to focus on the right things that lead to greater business outcomes with customers.  Nothing you do is small.  And this is just the beginning! So well done.  Thank you for bringing your creative juices to the table every day and helping us all build the future of GF! Incredible leadership.\n\n141#UX research swag|Rebecca,  I wish to thank you for helping with the UX research swag items. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction with Go Promotions. It was very useful to jump in on something that has already been done, it saves a lot of time and efforts in finding the right items and since you already have that its great. It's also consistent with everything else and from brand identity side of things and I'm super excited to be sending this out to our costumers. Thank you =]\n\n142#Guppy Tank Stars!|I just wanted to thank you all for your help, work and participation in the Guppy Tank event today.  The kids and their teachers were so appreciative and told us that down to the last Globoforce person, each interaction was so genuine and helpful and that we were great at working with the kids!  The teachers told me that this was the most important lesson of the year so far!  We even had a few kids ask us if they could stay in touch so they could work here in 10 years - maybe this is a way to build future Globostars!  Well done everyone and thank you so very much for  your time today!\n\n143#Happy Helpers!|Becky, Tracey & Rich! A big thank you to all of you for your help with the Customer Success offsite (onsite). Becky, from the moment we started planning, you always offered to help in any way you could. The night before, you came to help us set the room up, make it perfect and even write the message on the wall! You are the best! Tracey, you saw me running around and came over and asked to help. Going through the MANY, MANY boxes of charity event donations would not have gone as quickly and smoothly without your help! Thanks for taking time out of your day to help out! Rich, the morning of, you came in early to get some work done. Little did you know I was going to seek you out to see if you could help with carrying some stuff up from the cars, setting up the food tables and offering to help in any way we needed! Thank you for taking the time you set aside to get some work done to help us out! You 3 ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n144#Research Program Progress|All,  I want to thank you all for taking the time, going to meetings, giving feedback and helping with the progress of our User Research Program. Your ongoing support and feedback are helping myself and Sean to improve our presentation and this is ultimately going to help us run better research and deliver more accurate results back to the product team. All of this for the ultimate goal to improve our products. Thank you =]\n\n145#What a Wonderful Partner!|Becky, I wanted to recognize and thank you for the fantastic effort you've put into helping bridge gaps in our cross functional departments! More specifically, as of late you have been a fantastic ambassador for UX and what we are trying to achieve with user research - even sharing the valuable insights and positive comments our customers have said about our product experience. You are always trying to look at improvements, new ways to streamline processes and just make things better no matter what the cause. Above all, your positive attitude and personality really shines through and it's a pleasure to work with you no matter what the project. Thanks for all of the time you've put into collaborating with us and sharing valuable insights. Looking forward to working with you more on all these great initiatives.\n\n146#The best of the best!|I am constantly amazed at how much I learn from you every.single.day! You truly inspire me to do better and be better by setting a fantastic example, giving quality feedback and teaching me ways to enhance everything I create/put together. A perfect example is from today when I learned not one thing, but at LEAST 3 things from you in the matter of a couple of hours: optimizing a presentation, upleveling a spreadsheet with a few clicks/additions and showing me a better way to represent the data. I hope you know how much I truly appreciate you and your guidance. I am forever GRATEFUL! Thank you, Becky!\n\n147#All of the customer things!!!|Becky, thank you so much for taking time out of your VERY busy day to walk Laura and I through the customer journey and some of the background behind all of the amazing things the customer experience team does behind the scenes! You were so thorough and did a wonderful job explaining all of the details. This is going to be invaluable to help us craft a great marketing plan to meet those steep goals. Thanks for being such a great teammate!\n\n148#We are live!|Thank you both for your efforts in helping me with the post launch survey. It was important to me that we were consistent in tone and writing style with this welcome message against the NPS survey welcome message as it will set the stage for when they receive that next touch point. Lauren, you did an fantastic job doing just that when crafting the message and with such ease! Becky, your CX knowledge was valuable to me to ensure our two surveys were aligned and cohesive on the approach, tracking and reporting. It’s another customer touch point to add to our arsenal.\n\n149#Diving into the Details!|Thank you, Becky, for your diligent work diving into the details regarding the CSAT survey!  You ensured the \"close the loop\" inner circle was executed perfectly, reviewed the process for future efficiency opportunities, read every single comment, extrapolated themes and now we are building a great action plan to help close the remaining loop - internal briefings, agree actions we want to take as a business and share with customers the actions we are taking thanks to their feedback.  All this will help us purposely and thoughtfully move the needle on customer satisfaction and drive loyalty!  Thank you for your tremendous efforts throughout this project.\n\n150#GloboInnovation H1 2018 1st Place|Congratulations on your 1st place finish in this year's H1 GloboInnovation program with your entry of \"Meet users where they are!\" idea! Obviously, we loved this idea and during voting actually called it a \"Homerun!\" and said \"let's install that by the end of the day!\" It's a great integration of an essential workplace tool. Congratulations! Thank you for participating and taking the extra time out of your busy schedule to work on this.\n\n151#Mindful meetings!|I just wanted to thank you for grabbing me to chat about an upcoming meeting so we could better define people's roles on the project. In the spirit of respecting everyone's time and running leaner meetings you took it by the horns and we were able to give 4 people back an hour of their time and put the most qualified and relevant people in the room. This was one of those things we talked about in the manager's training and I'm SO glad you stopped me from just blinding walking into another meeting without looking at it from a higher level. It has already reinvigorated me about curating my meeting-life to only the ones where I can add the most value! THANK YOU!!!\n\n152#Looking through the lens of efficiency!|What an excellent job you did to prepare for our WorkHuman 2018 efficiencies review meeting!  To say I was blown away is an understatement. You had displayed all the aspects of the customer experience on sticky notes and listed all the activities within each section.  This prep allowed us to spend 2 short hrs going through each aspect to decide what we wanted to continue, make more efficient, more appropriately allocate or cease doing.  Great start in our efficiency project to make managing the customer experience at WorkHuman 2019 more streamlined and successful!  Thank you!\n\n153#Shinning stars for Eaton’s 5 yr Anniversary Video|Thank you so much for volunteering your time and hidden acting dancing and improv talents to celebrate Eaton’s 5 year anniversary team!! They LOVED the video and was super impressed by both your talented acting skills and creativity! Most of all, they appreciate what great partners we are and for always injecting our own special brand of fun with humans and heart at the center of it all! Oscar nominations for everyone!!\n\n154#Bringing Ideas To Life|This award is so overdue! Anytime I reach out to the three of you whether individually or as a group, you make any idea seem possible! The most recent one being the wonderful Video for Eaton to celebrate e-stars’s 5 year anniversary. Of course they LOVED it and were so appreciative. They were incredibly impressed by the creativity of the Globoforce team and how we produce such quality work be it in a heartfelt message or a formal business meeting. Talk about versatility!! That is one in many other (big and small) projects that we’ve collaborated on over the last few months from JetBlue, WorkHuman, Biogen and Covance just to name a few.  Traci - you have been my partner in crime since day one! I love how you are always so open and embracing of creative ways to accomplish anything we set out minds to. You always add such value to the conversation and have so many creative ideas on speed dial, whether it’s a business or people effort. Rebecca!!! You are just amazing to work with. I cannot even begin to name all the ways in which you have pulled through for me on some out of the box requests! The best part? You make me laugh till my stomach hurts even while we’re trying to figure out how to make the impossible possible! Amanda - what can I say? I’ve always been a fan. You are hyper focused and super dependable especially when the project is an extra challenging one! Thank you so very much for all that you do and for bringing your best selves to work each day!\n\n155#Customer Experience Maven|Really impressive job today during your presentation on how to simplify and make our NPS survey process more actionable and customer-focused.  Your customer experience knowledge shined and the presentation you created was thorough, visually appealing and hit on every angle.  I admire your passion for the customer and for high quality work!  #customerexperiencematters\n\n156#Meaningful Meeting|Thank you for providing valuable feedback, thoughtful insights and strategic solutions as we debriefed on the WorkHuman Executive Forum and discussed the needs for this audience and C-level involvement moving forward. Your honest input and positive outlook helped to align our thinking as we move into planning for 2019. Leadership is a key theme as we prepare for WorkHuman and is was a key quality exemplified in today's meeting!\n\n157#The best partner one could ever ask for!|Rebecca, over the last one year, we have collaborated on so many projects--speakers for WorkHuman, Baker's Dozen, Gartner Peer Insights, customers for speaking engagements and customer press releases to name a few. Each time, I am blown away by your commitment and passion to keep things moving forward. If something gets stuck, you are quick to offer up another approach. If something needs a follow-up, you are on top of it. Its thanks to you and your willingness to help that we have been able to bring so many customer stories to light. You are an absolutely amazing partner to our team!\n\n158#All orange all the time|I am still digging back to the surface of real work after WorkHuman, but also still riding the high! I wanted to take a moment and thank you all properly for the amazing lift that was this year's customer experience. I loved our weekly meetings, brainstorming countless ideas (and we'll use everything we DIDN'T do for next year!), and just crafting something beautiful and meaningful for our #1 humans–the customers! Becky, you were a dream to work with on every last detail and site visit, Amanda, you were my go-to for last minute details and triple checking all our work so we could put our best foot forward, and Alice, your guidance on the experience and the massive changes we made to it this year made sure that their events were spectacular. I loved watching it all come together, on rooftops and in ballrooms and I can't wait to figure out how to make it even better next year. THANK YOU!\n\n159#Bringing WHRI Wizardry to Senior Exec Customers!|In the first initiative of its kind in our industry, you helped the WorkHuman Analytics & Research Institute to bring together a session between leading human capital academics and our top HR executive customers.  Elevating the level of conversations we have with our customers is a company-wide goal.  Getting those executive level conversations  and influence points isn't easy.  And - a two hour long event that included Adam Grant and Shawn Achor was no easy feat to pull off during a WorkHuman that included so many tantalizing choices for those executives.  Thank you all for the parts you played - many of them last-minute!  From Kevin helping to open the door with Adam and Ethan, to Lynette and Rebecca being customer recruiting powerhouses, to Stacey and Pam helping with meeting logistics and making sure the group was taken care of, to Matt pushing a last-minute reminder in the WH app so we didn't lose any of these C-level HR execs, to Greg and Chris for working the room with me and making sure customers felt welcome and that we captured next steps with them.  I've heard tons of great feedback from customers on this session and I know this is the beginning of a successful multi-year initiative for Globoforce!  THANK YOU!!\n\n160#Customers First!!!!!!|Becky, no one has any idea just how many thousands of details you have owned to make our customer experience at WorkHuman come together so seamlessly. You have provided your vision, creativity insight and perspective across the entire experience throughout the planning and execution phases to deliver an incredible success!  You are my dream partner in crime and I am so grateful to be able to count on your incredible attention to detail and unwavering support in realizing the vision we created. I love the fact that I can agree a plan with you and trust without doubt that you will own it and deliver against that plan without fail!  You raise things to me when needed and make decisions when needed that totally align to our agreed principles of operation!  We have such fun working together- even when things get stressful, you always remain cool calm and collected as we work through the ‘opportunity” of the moment! Thank you Becky for being a massive part of the successful customer experience at WorkHuman- I am so excited to see this great experience translate into driving our business goals during the remainder of 2018 and beyond!  Thank you - you are very appreciated!!!\n\n161#WH Customer Experience|Alice and Rebecca, as we hit the last few days before WorkHuman 2018, I want to recognize the amazing work you have done over the past six months to create a thoughtful, inspiring customer experience at WorkHuman that also delivers on our business goals.  Every little detail about the teams, ambassadors, executives, shark tank, awards, customer lounge, briefing documents etc. etc. etc. has been delivered with deep thought and a high bar for excellence.  Your collective ability to remember every little detail and to consider the entire customer experience has been inspiring and I have full confidence that this will be our best WorkHuman yet.  I realize that there is a whole team of people contributing to the cause but your dedication in carrying the flag for Customer Success and being part of all planning since day one has made all the difference.  On behalf of our whole team and the customers themselves...THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!\n\n162#NBCU Dream Team!|Thank you Alice, Amanda & Rebecca for your dedication to NBCU's WorkHuman group experience!  There have been a lot of moving parts, twist and turns, internal & customer meetings to attend, process changes, lists to maintain etc.  With so many other priorities this time of year, I appreciate ALL that you have done to support me.  It's been a team effort and I have enjoyed working with all of you!\n\n163#Superstars!|Thank you both for your superstar partnership in Shark Tank planning & production. You are truly wonderful to work with - decisive, creative, and pragmatic, staying true to our strategic objectives with this session, making sure we're delivering a top quality experience for customers and also making this fun. We've had to rise to new challenges with the growth of our audience, and you've introduced ideas, solutions, and thoughtful insights all the way along. You've made every aspect of this better. You are both amazing colleagues!\n\n164#Meet & Greets|Rebecca and Tom, thank you both for all your work going into the WorkHuman meet & greets. We are fortune to have several speakers participating this year but that amounts to more work when it comes to compiling customer and prospect lists. As much as we try to streamline the process a portion of it will always remain manual and you two have been the driving force behind it.\n\n165#My Rock of Gibraltar|Becky – what would I do without you!  I just want to call out how incredible you are!!!  We - and by we, I mean Globoforce, Customer Success, our customers and me – are so fortunate to have you working in Customer Experience!  A few words that pop into my mind when I think of you… Graceful, proactive, thoughtful, creative, innovative, thorough, trusted, patient, kind, diligent, appropriately persistent, intuitive, customer-centric, focused, attention to detail and simply amazing!  Over the last several weeks you have taken charge and run with so many key initiatives to deliver upon exactly what was needed for the customer experience at WorkHuman according to the timelines agreed with Sparks, Creative, Product and content without missing a beat!  I thank my lucky stars that I get to partner with you on all things WorkHuman and Customer Experience as I feel we are 100% aligned!  I trust you 100% and never have to follow up to make sure that you have delivered upon what we have discussed and agreed – instead you proactively tell me what you have actioned, the follow ups that are required and where you need my support, direction or guidance.  Thank you for being the best partner ever!  I have said it before and I will say it again… this role is your perfect fit!  I am excited about what we have created for WorkHuman 2018 and also about what we can achieve in 2018!!!  Thank you, Becky - I appreciate you!\n\n166#It's all about the customers|Becky, it's been great working with you this year on making the customer experience at WH great. You had a great vision and it's been so much fun working together to make it all a reality. I can't wait to kick off WH with the Customer Cocktail Party!\n\n167#Testimonial Train|Alice and Rebecca, Thank you SO much for your partnership on the next round of testimonials. This is no small task - we need to take into consideration the key topics we want to capture, the stories our customers have to share, the dozens of other asks for our customers at WorkHuman, program design, registrations, quality of speakers, etc. Then it's thinking through outreach and ensuring everyone is in the loop. It is invaluable to have your insight along the way. Thank you for taking the time amid all of the other work leading up to WorkHuman. Much appreciated!\n\n168#Amerisource User testing|Thanks, team for your involvement in the recent Amerisource usability test for EC3!  While this project originated with UX, I was so happy to be apart of it and glean so much from the first client call I joined.  I appreciate everyone's effort in embracing the initiative and refining the process to make the most of this opportunity to get feedback on our new ecomm experience direct from our clients!  #teamworkdreamwork\n\n169#Decor Dream Team!|Ladies, thank you for your enthusiasm (Laury), energy, decor expertise (Sara-looking at you), height (Becky :) ), and for making our GloboCafé look so wonderful for Valentine's Day. Great teamwork!\n\n170#56 Day Countdown|Flying home from Austin, I could not help but think that the next time I was on this flight, I would be returning from WH18. I also feel so thankful to work with people who are so dedicated to making this a fantastic event.  We got so much accomplished in our short 24 hours. Everyone showed up with their goals and priorities for the visit and set out to make sure they were accomplished. You have all been so great to work with during the planning of WH18 and we are now a giant step further and heading into the home stretch.\n\n171#No Mountain Too High!|Thank you Becky for your incredible determination and imagination delivering exceptional innovation!  Firstly, driving the video testimonials for all our 2017 WorkHuman award winners to be creatively crafted and filmed at Ignite meaning that you were at the hotel at 7am on a Sunday morning to get everything set up through to 5pm helping each team member through their part - it was a very long day and you did it with a great big smile and a bucket load of energy!  Secondly, jumping in for me at the last minute and covering off all the customer panel open items for Ignite meant that I felt 100% confident nothing was left undone - thank you for your support during that period - professionally and personally!  Finally, you are doing a stellar job across so many project areas that we are juggling concerning Customer Experience!  2018 is going to be an amazing year for us and I am so grateful that you are my Customer Experience partner in crime!  :-)  Thank you!\n\n172#BP Energize! Army|It takes a small army to land and launch a client. So, fall in and take your praise. I want you all to know that the BP team said that this was one of their favorite projects in all their time with BP. They have been live for 3 days and communicated just today that this was a model launch. This is all thanks to your contributions, big and small. From contract to launch, we did it in a bit over 4 months. Incredible team work everyone. It is always a bit bumpy during a launch, not matter how well we plan something always pops up and we always figure it out. Something I learned about the GF team, we always figure it out, even if it is ½ a second before the launch. Thank you for everything you did to make this launch a success. You each had an important role and it shows in the immediate success of this launch. Well done team!! I appreciate you!\n\n173#Last minute wizardry|Rebecca, thank you for picking up the ball and providing magical continuity when unforeseen circumstances arose this week.  You ensured our customers felt appreciated at Ignite and worked feverishly to track down key items last minute for our team offsite on Wednesday.  And it was always with a smile and a laugh.  We're so lucky to have you on our team.  Well done!\n\n174#WH Contest Wizards!|Amanda and Becky, thank you so much for putting together the WH contest. As a coordinator, it is a great way for me to be able to participate in drumming up interest in the event and generally being involved. Beyond that though, it is clear how much work and consideration you put into this contest - from the rules, to the teams, to the tie breakers, and to the reporting. I truly appreciate your Imagination and Determination on this project. Great job, ladies!\n\n175#Making Magic|Shouting it out to you, Rebecca, for making magic happen for our customers on a regular basis.  Time and time again, I have seen your creative genius at work.  You have stepped into the role of a lifetime and our customers are benefitting from it every day.  Most recently, you took it upon yourself to create a custom celebration for Nina R at Intuit for her 10 year anniversary.  It would have been easy to simply reach out to everyone internally and ask for a quick note or photo.  Instead, you delivered a compilation video that celebrates Nina and her very personal relationships with GF and it will honestly blow Nina away.  Our work is so personal and it absolutely should be.  Thank you for stepping up to the plate every day and creating memories that will resonate for years to come!\n\n176#Nailed it!  Again and again!!!|Becky, I wanted to take a moment to call out all of your exceptional work within the Customer Experience realm!

Together we are achieving great progress every single day, driving our Customer Experience initiatives forward! I am so proud to watch you flourish and grow within your role!  You jump at every single chance to own an area, proactively take on projects and research and strive each day to be the best that you can be in this role!  I love that about you!  Don't ever stop sharing your opinions and crazy innovative ideas!!!  That is how we move the needle!  Even though not every idea can turn into a reality each one expands our thinking and tests our boundaries!  That is a critical piece in how we are able to progress swiftly and confirm the right path for us on each occasion!  As we head into the break I wanted to be sure you know just how much I love working with you and how proud I am of all your accomplishments!  Enjoy the time with your family and rest up!  Thank you, Becky, and I look forward to a kick-ass 2018!!!!\n\n177#Customer Experience|Alice and Becky, well done on the work thus far measuring our customer experience and putting together an action plan to make this a sustainable data-oriented process.  It gives us a great sense of where we stand and where our opportunities for growth exist.  You attacked this challenge with enthusiasm and determination and we are off to a great start.  Well done!\n\n178#Maestro behind the scenes for JetBlue for Good!|Rebecca thanks for working hard and very strategically coordinating behind the scenes to make this happen! You helped with conversations with the JetBlue team and diligently worked through the details that comes with participating in something like this. You're always so thoughtful and even managed to solve last minute changes to ensure all went smoothly. You made sure I was prepared down to where I should stay in order to be close to the event.

You are always there for me no matter the situation and I am sincerely SO thankful for you.  I boast about you regularly to my friends and family! You are always helping out whenever needed - making sure all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed. Most recently when I had a family (and cat) emergency, you took the initiative to make sure everything was in order and ready to go. I cannot begin to account for all of the times you have made a situation better in the workplace because there are SO MANY.  I could never thank you enough for being such a great leader, mentor and all around wonderful person to me, personally and professionally.

Susie - It has been wonderful getting your knowledge and input on this webinar. You have so much experience in this area and I am excited to continue to collaborate with you. Alice and Rebecca - Thank you as always for being my teammates on the webinar and for always being there when we have questions or need approvals on marketing materials! Finally, Amanda, you are my forever webinar partner and I don't know what I would do without you! Between SharePoint frustrations to potential sound quality issues and, of course, content in between, you never waiver and are calm, cool, and collected. This truly was a webinar dream team and I am so happy to have worked with all of you on a successful event!\n\n184#Doing Your Life's Best Work!|Becky – I wanted to call out the great work that you are doing across the board in your new role!  This role fits you like a glove!  You are in your perfect right spot!!!  Thank you so much for your tremendous energy and passion for perfection and your determination to deliver the best possible customer experience!

There were about 200 of their crewleaders present including their Executives and members of the prestigious Founders group. We managed to get some great live feedback that we can use to highlight areas of opportunity in support of their goals for the evolution of LiFT. There was a tremendous amount of work and creativity that went into this to create some really memorable moments. Becky, Dan and Amanda: Thank you for your hard work and dedication to create a Timelines experience to celebrate their 5 years of LiFTing! We presented the custom iPad that was preloaded with the Timelines experience to Mike and his team and they were incredibly moved and impressed as evident in that picture of happy smiling faces! Mark - you have been a great partner taking over from Jodi and ensuring we manage the many moving pieces carefully with a focus on the relationship management, ongoing strategy and long term goals.

I'm really excited to collaborate with you on these new initiatives. Thank you =]\n\n190#Getting the customer survey out the door|Rebecca and Anthony, thanks for all your help last week to get the recognition survey out the door in a timely manner. We were just back from WorkHuman but you quickly pulled the list of customers  together, vetted the list, created an email template, tested it and sent it out quickly! The results from this survey are looked at by many prospects when going through an RFP process so thanks for executing it quickly!\n\n191#GloboInnovation H1 2017 2nd Place|Congratulations on placing 2nd in the H1 2017 GloboInnovation program with your \"Company wide awards\" idea. This is obviously a massive pain point and the presentation was well done. You're preaching to the choir on this and the work done to develop a solution was impressive. One judge, we won't say who, did say \"I think they'd miss that spreadsheet.\" Thank you for participating and taking the extra time out of your busy schedule to work on this\n\n192#Happy Customers, Happy Life|When I think of WorkHuman... I think of you! I wanted to take the time to recognize what wonderful partners you have been to me on this journey.

We make an amazing team!\n\n193#Partner in Crime|Rebecca, thanks for being my partner in crime during the Customer Awards ceremony.  It may seem like a simple task to others but I know that greeting, congratulating and directing the customers while everyone in the room is staring you is not as easy as it looks.

We couldn't have scheduled testimonials without your help.\n\n198#Take 1000|Thank you for your patience during my day long video shoot. It took all day and 3 people. Team work at it's best.

Thanks to you all we are able to show our true colors and represent Globoforce in the best way possible!\n\n202#Intuit maestro|Becky,  I have to thank you for all your help with Intuit.

It's so clear that you've invested your blood, sweat and tears into the Intuit relationship and that you've helped the program become the success that is today.  You've openly passed along an amazing amount of insight with how the program team thinks and have always shown a focus in delivering a quality experience with this program.

Your historical perspective has been a great help in navigating the Spotlight waters and helping to continue to set their program up for success.  Thank you!\n\n203#Partnering on Customer Stories|Rebecca - thanks for your support as we bring customer stories to life. Customer stories take many forms — long-form case studies, slideware, videos, quotes, anecdotes — so there needs to be a thoughtful, streamlined process for bringing these to market. You've done a great job providing the marketing team with updated metrics while helping with the approval process. Referenceable accounts are marketing's greatest asset and a key driver of new business. Thanks for your partnership.\n\n204#Work Human Queen!|Becky, I just got off of my call with Minto, and when I brought up Work Human, Meghan was telling me how amazing you are.

She said you were \"fantastic\" \"helpful\" and \"the nicest person\" (which I have to say I completely agree with).

You have been such an amazing partner on this account and I can't thank you enough for all of your hard work!!!!\n\n211#Linking Up|It's not easy to transition a 'demanding' customer to a 'new' customer success manager but you are making it look like a walk in the park.  Thanks for bringing our new Irish program manager up to speed in such smooth style!  You're getting her access to the right training and resources and setting her up for success.

Good teamwork to get this resolved quickly and effectively!\n\n213#Bravo!|SO many congrats and thanks to you for all the creative work and cat herding that went in to refreshing and relaunching the Bravo! site at Varian Medical.

Thank you for all of the details, all of the late nights and weekends, and for smiling through it all.  Bravo!\n\n214#Awesome Partner|Rebecca it has been quite a while, but now that we have finally closed this first stage project with Gilead, I want to thank you and let the Globoforce world know the huge part you played in this win!  The final stand up presentation on sight was just you and me, but I can say without hesitation, and since it was only us no one can refute it :-), that your presence that day was a major factor and had a great impact on their evaluation committee determining they could only trust their YOS program to Globoforce. Your professionalism, your poise, your absolute and complete mastery of the topic, helped us shine.  In fact, when I was leaving their building after a subsequent follow up meeting, their project lead confided that the confidence you inspired in their entire team and the professionalism shown was unmatched by any of our competitors.  So thank you again for helping inspire confidence and helping us win, our newest client!\n\n215#Every Day is a Victory!|It's not every day you receive an email from a client with a request to post their video of thanks to our own Globostars. (darn secure video upload keeping me from loading) Sadaf said she wanted to show her thanks with something more powerful than a quick email. 'Despite any challenges we face, we come out victorious.' This is to thank you for going the extra mile and building such a strong relationship with FireEye. In the toughest of times, those relationships are what make the difference and that is exactly what helped us through the past few weeks. I couldn't agree with Sadaf more on the value of the help and support you  have given in some pretty precarious situations. No one is better than you at keeping the Spark! alive!\n\n216#11pm WorkHuman helper|Thanks Rebecca for offering to help me get speaker notes printed as a backup before the respective tracks took off.  I ran into you around the Atlanta room and you offered to get the notes ready for me in the morning since your customer duties gave you an hour back.  I appreciated the teamwork since I had an early morning and would have had to miss the kickoff to get it done once FedEx opened.  It's great to know you can depend on others; you didn't have to offer, but you did - you handled it and delivered to me well on time so my track session could go off without a hitch. Thank you!\n\n217#Rebuilding Customer Confidence|Thanks to you we are starting to regain the positive customer capital that was lost with Nina and her team in Intuit due to the downstream impacts associated with the outage.  Although this has been a very trying time for all concerned and tested us to the full, it is satisfying to see the team pull together to come up with the plan to help the customer.  We have had many calls and interactions over the past few weeks and through it all have managed to keep that spirit of teamwork and understanding that is central to our company's cultural identity. Thank you for your help and support and for taking calls on the east coast before you have had a morning coffee!\n\n218#Sparking even on Sundays|Thank you SO much for your commitment and selflessness to the major program changes and supporting communication launches at FireEye.  Our customer is in the midst of some major organizational changes and our ability to support those critical pieces that align Spark! with their objectives has been significant for them.  Both of you have been working at all hours of the night and weekends to support the effort and be overly responsive in order to relieve any fears the customer may have regarding changes.  I cannot thank you enough for being such amazing partners.  T3 ROCKS!\n\n219#Team Effort|Thank you so much for jumping in to help make sure that our WH Ambassadors are visible  during WH! You are all super busy and yet managed to come together and deliver a perfect solution in no time at all!  Thank you!\n\n220#Spotlight 2.0 Happens!!!! Thank You|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Customers!!!! You did it!!! You deserve to have the brightest Spotlight shining on you today.  After years of planning and finally getting the green light, Intuit launches peer to peer awards with monetary value as well as other new program features today!  This is due to your dedication, commitment, leadership, will-do, can-do attitude, the daily calls and death-do-us-part we're going to make this happen skills.  I truly appreciated your commitment and persistence in solving the outstanding issues in order to make this happen.  Intuit was tough at times but you always kept their employees in mind, wanting only the best recognition experience possible and pushed through!  On behalf of all employees who now can recognize anyone in the company with monetary awards ... Thank you!!! thank you!!!\n\n221#Bravo!

During our account review they sang your praises and Brad even mentioned you should be receiving the Trendsetter award at WorkHuman too because of the great collaboration.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n226#Consistently Outstanding|Rebecca, once again I was blown away today by our call with a customer. I hung up and thought \"Rebecca is simply amazing \"!  You consistently understand how to very clearly listen to the customers concerns/requests and ferret out the heart of the matter in a very supportive and thoughtful way. Then you do an amazing job of articulating proposed solutions that are in line with the integrity of the recognition strategy. This skill is something that takes mastery and I believe you have mastered it beautifully! I love delighting customers and truly partnering to solve business problems and I love getting to do it with you!! Cheers!\n\n227#Great Customer Feedback!|Well done Rebecca! Yesterday I had a meeting with LinkedIn in California and they sang your praises for about a full 5 minutes! They said you were a fantastic account manager and gave them an incredible level of service. They insisted that I recognize you! Thats exactly the kind of customer respect that only comes from long hours of dedicated service. Your attitude makes the difference and they couldn't be happier with the attention they receive - and why wouldn't they!! Fabulous job Rebecca, Well done and Thank You!\n\n228#Sewing the Seeds of Success @ Sony|Rebecca - Our first joint interaction at Sony Pictures in LA required you to think on your feet, have a mastery of the subject matter, and combine the two sides of the Customer Success story like the combining of two pieces of fabric!  Your ability to understand the customers current situation with their various desires for addressing change in the future and how Globoforce will be their all along their journey was stiched together and made it easy for the clients to understand.  This was our first sales pitch together and you did a great job on behalf of the customer service team and I look forward to the next pitch with you!  Well done.\n\n229#Cognizant R&R Launch Teamwork|I want to give a huge thank you to all of you for your continued support over the past year plus on the Cognizant implementation. It has been a very long road with many ups and downs, starts and stops, but together as a team we did it!! I feel like it is the end of a long running soap. What an interesting journey with lots of great lessons and lots of great teamwork. Thanks again!! You guys are awesome!!\n\n230#Above and Beyond|When I asked for you to pull together initial launch stats for LinkedIn to share with our executives, you went above and beyond on the details you provided. You provided the high level program design and launch details to level set and then pulled in stats on LI’s program team/executives including their congrats numbers. Even more, you gathered specific LI company materials around appreciation and engagement. You thought outside the box on what might be meaningful to share and weave into future conversations with LI executives themselves. Great job on your forward thinking!\n\n231#LinkedIn Feedback!|The first words out of Brad's mouth when I joined your call today was \"Becky is an outstanding partner\" and \"Christina said this was an A implementation\" that they are seeing much success from. Their success is thanks to all your tireless support and leading them towards a fantastic accomplishment for their company. I love hearing client feedback on your great work!\n\n232#Bravo! LinkedIn Launch Inspirer!|In recognition of living our value of Innovation = Imagination   Determination!  Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! scream and shout it .. read all about it!  Rebecca is a Rock Star for so many reasons ...  let's all cheer, here's why!   At the last minute without hesitation you raised your hand and said \"I'll help, I'll take the lead with LinkedIn and leap in as the Launch Manager and allow my colleague to take care of a family hardship situation.\"  And off you went, from Design Lab to working with the core project team week on week to ensure all of the decisions LinkedIn was making aligned with a program that would truly lead to building a culture of recognition and appreciation.  Of course, with all great things comes challenges.  This was the first client whereby half of the program team worked for other companies who had a currency-based recognition program and couldn't get their heads around points.  This topic came up numerous times and even with 3 days to go before launch YOU were able to continue the strong messaging around why points and win them over.  Each and every week you guided them, lead them through decision making, kept them focused on task at hand, recommended others join the project team all to ensure the program design, launch and necessary internal processes were built, tested and validated before launch.  This was one of the toughest launches in company history but usually the toughest challenges produce the greatest rewards.  On behalf of all LinkedIn employees who can now recognize each other for their contributions, achievements and successes - THANK YOU for keeping up the fight, believing so deeply in the Power of Thanks and making us all better people along the way!  You Inspire Us All!  Bravo! Bravo! All the best, Traci\n\n233#WorkHuman Teamwork!|Thank you Becky for working with me representing the Customer Success team for all things WorkHuman!  You have been such an amazing help to me during the last 8 weeks as we have created the Customer Experience for WorkHuman! From the initial recruitment efforts, input on the many customer videos, gathering customer assets and information from the team, communication out to the team to on-site registration, printing of additional name tags and badges and the last minute, real -time race to the finish line table and seating assignment changes!  You have assisted with great professionalism, a big smile and phenomenal attention to detail!  It is sooooo great to have been able to  count on you from start to finish!  We are so fortunate to have you as part of the team and I am so grateful for your incredible efforts to make the customer experience a success at WorkHuman!  Thank you!!!\n\n234#Great Customer Feedback from Intuit!|Thank you Becky for always delivering excellence to your customers!  I love to hear our valued customers, partners and friends share their joy of working with us!  Nina at Intuit shared in a recent note to me \"Rebecca does such an amazing job for us\".  A great piece of feedback for sure! You have shown such imagination, determination, innovation and respect in your work with Intuit and you have been a key contributor in driving the success of Spotlight since taking over their account!  Excellent job and thank you!\n\n235#Bringing the Human to WorkHuman|Rebecca, what a journey we have had together over the past 5 months on WorkHuman!  Remember when it was just you and me trying to figure out how to rally the troops and create a great customer experience when many of our CS leaders were on leave?  (And by that, I mean...remember when it was only you?!!)  You have been a superb ambassador for Customer Success and your ideas around recognizing the team, the WH contest, finding ways to minimize the disruption with for CS team members and your unique customer experience suggestions have made a very real and material impact on the success of WorkHuman 2015.  Your dedication to your colleagues and consideration of their circumstances and feelings ensured that we \"kept the humanity\" during a time when we had a huge amount of work to do and less people to do it.  We couldn't have done it without you.  Thank you for your dedication, passion, positivity and commitment to excellence!  Well done!\n\n236#Night Warrior - LinkedIn APAC HRBPs Webinar|In recognition of living our value of Respect for Customers!  Rebecca, you're the glue that keeps the whole LinkedIn Bravo! program together.  Each and every day you add tremendous value and guidance to Brad at LinkedIn so that in the near future every employee will know what it feels like to be personally recognized for their above & beyond contributions, achievements and successes! Your on-going coaching and mentoring of Brad paid off tonight big time!  Yep at 10pm ET, we officially kicked-off the first HRBPs regional webinars with the APCA region.  It was evident by the questions and interactions those HRBPs are fully engaged and excited about launching Bravo!  You did an amazing job with the demo to bring it all home for them.  Well done with extra energy and excitement in the weeee hours.  The hard-stop they mentioned seemed to disappear once you took over the reigns and started the demo!  All of your hard work and dedication is coming to fruition and I could hear the excitement in the HRBPs voices for the program!  Thanks for all that you do to make Globoforce, your colleagues and our clients GREAT!!!!  Rebecca Rocks!!!\n\n237#Spotlight on YOU!!!!|In recognition of living our value of innovation = imagination   determination!  A huge SPOTLIGHT on Eileen and Rebecca for all of their hard work, efforts and unbelievable passion for ensuring Intuit had an amazing 10 year anniversary celebration!  From the months and months of planning, every detail:  the right memorable gift, right executive dinner location, menu, wording in the invite to the on-site celebration event with employees- what should that look and feel like.  Who's on point for the food, decorations, theme etc.  All of those details reviewed, modified and changed until they were perfected and delivered flawlessly!  It's such a JOY to work with both of you.  Your imagination, determination and dedication is unbelievable.  You get Sherry Whitely (CHRO), Mason, Eva and Nina to be inspired, want to do more, continue to be trailblazers and lead the way.  Thanks for bring it - each and every day!  Video speaks louder than words, so let me share with everyone your AWESOMENESS in ACTION ...\n\n238#Spotlight's 10 Year Anniversary|Wow.  Somehow that word falls short of an appropriate descriptor for the amazing experience that was Intuit's 10 year anniversary of Spotlight.  Thank you for all the imagination and execution that went into creating an exceptional experience for the entire Intuit team.  Not many had the chance to see all the work over the past 6 months that went into planning (and rescheduling, and planning and rescheduling) this great event.  But you stuck with it and the end result was spectacular.  The daytime experience in the employee center was quite the spectacle with hundreds of employees, what felt like a million Spotlight 10 stickers, laughter, selfies, cupcakes (of course) and a surprise CEO visit.  (Making Traci's dream come true!) The timeline  you conceived and brought to life via the iPads was supported by many others but it was your commitment and dedication that saw it through to completion and earned so much well-deserved delight and praise from the CHRO and entire Intuit Spotlight team.  Even the little details like the branded M&Ms were key pieces that made the customer experience amazing.  Key executives, including the CHRO, mentioned that this was the best experience with a vendor....EVER!  Well done on imagining and innovating another Globoforce first that we will have to find a way to recreate for other customers.  Thanks for blazing the trail and executing at such a high level.  Great work!\n\n239#Getting Close|I want to thank you guys for all of the hard work and patience you've put into the Cognizant implementation. It is hard to believe we are so close to launching phase one. I appreciate all your time and support. Getting on calls week after week for months helping guide them through this process, taking more than a few punches each for the team. It has been quite a journey. Thanks again.\n\n240#SSO TeamBuddies :)|I just want to say a million thanks for you coming to me with your own experiences on UAT for SSO Mobile. Without your own cheat sheet and client stories of what to look out for, I wouldn't be able to raise my coffee cup today and say thanks, because WNS Global, India just signed off on their SSO testing with flying colours. Thanks again!\n\n241#Working the process|Just wanted to thank you for our meeting. I so appreciate how organized and helpful you are. Your commitment to making WorkHuman a great experience for our customers and rallying your team in this last stretch toward the event is inspiring. I know that we are going to make it a spectacular experience! Thanks for jumping in and moving it along!\n\n242#Amazing Customer Focus!|Thank you for all of your hard work on making this account review phenomenal! You rocked it!\n\n243#Intuit Custom Timeline|A big shout out to the fabulous team that has created, developed, tested, and perfected the 10 Year Anniversary Timeline for delivery to our colleagues at Intuit.  I know it's taken a lot of time, creativity, technical expertise, and vision to create this experience.  Can't thank you all enough for putting your hearts into this project.  I think it's going to be hugely meaningful to our partners at Intuit.  Cheers to you!\n\n244#Client Implementation Reports|I'd like to say thank you for updating the spreadsheet every week. You've taken on board any changes which have occurred with the spreadsheet. It involved a torturous campaign on Sharepoint, but I feel that moving it to Box has worked a lot better for us. Also thanks for attending the Thursday morning meetings. These meetings are vital for myself, Stephen and UX team - and is great for keeping track of all dates.\n\n245#WorkHuman Customer Success Champion!|Rebecca, It has been fantastic to have you on the WorkHuman team as the Customer Success champion. You've brought creative, impactful ideas to the table, represented our client's needs, and ensured that we've covered all the bases for the Customer Success team. You've been a great partner to the marketing team and we truly appreciate it. Looking forward to the continued partnership over the next several months!\n\n"
"246#Successful Success Squad leadership|Rebecca- This is to recognize you for all of the work that you put in for 2014 for the Success Squad.  We accomplished a lot, and you were an instrumental leader on the team. As we both know, this is an add on volunteer committee where the work is usually done outside of regular business hours, and I don't think people know how much time and work it really takes.  Thank you for all of the work you put into the celebratory team space, lunch and learns, events and general organization for the committee. Now that you have stepped down from the team (hopefully temporarily!), I wanted to make sure you know how much your efforts have been appreciated.  Thank you!\n\n247#Linking all the pieces for LinkedIn|Thank you so much for taking the lead on these pre-contract meetings with LinkedIn!

This process has meant you've needed to work with multiple departments and gather disparate bits of data and all on a tight deadline. During this entire project, you've been gracious, humorous, and attentive. It's been inspiring watching you handle pulling together this huge milestone. And I really appreciate your unflagging good attitude and respect for working with others in order to achieve the best result for the customer, especially as it pertains to you needing to coordinate between departments.\n\n251#Get Er Done!|Thank you for going the extra mile today and helping to deliver the CSM/client information. This lack of information has been a problem for a long time but no one had come up with a proper solution.\n\n252#Usability Testing|Thanks for being such a great partner in delivering a very successful round of usability testing at Intuit. You were new to the account and to usability testing, but no-one would have known that from how effectively and professionally you assisted the IT team in preparing the test environment, running the sessions and recording all the valuable feedback over the two days so thoroughly and efficiently. No request for help before or during the tests was a problem, you were so central to things running smoothly and to helping the team execute a record-breaking number of tests over the two days. Thank You for all your help!\n\n253#Star CSM|Rebecca I want to thank you for your continued help with Cognizant. Your professionalism and attention to detail are very much appreciated.

PS, let’s frame Becky's masterpiece!  :-)\n\n257#Take Charge|Thank you for your take charge approach with the Sensata transition.

You are doing a wonderful job helping them to their success and they wanted to say \"Thank You!\"  A technical glitch forced me to adjust the message slightly so I put together the attached video to help you capture the moment.  Well done and enjoy!\n\n264#Great Team!|Thank you Corporate Customer Success Manger Team for all of your help during my first 4 weeks at Globoforce.  I am so excited to join this team and look forward to working with you and getting to know you all better in the near future.\n\n265#1st Client Launched Using New Corp Client Process|Congrats Rebecca on not only launching FireEye with ease, but also being the first to do it through the new Corporate Client Process. As part of tracking issues, we have used a new instance of Bugzilla. This worked great for FireEye, leading us to use less emails and Skype, and keeping all changes, testing and issues on one area. I hope you felt it went as well as I thought, and so i hope you enjoy this deserved award. And I'll try to make sure they have vouchers for Gogarty's in Temple Bar on our Redeem page so you can use them next time you're over. ;)\n\n266#Making my life easier!|Becky!
