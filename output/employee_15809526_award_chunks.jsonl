So a big thank you to you all and I cannot wait to continue working with you in 2024.\n\n60#$$$|As the year draws to a close, I want to express thanks on behalf of the entire Global Category Management team for the endless insights, guidance and collaboration we've shared throughout 2023.

The card was stuck at the onboarding stage for a total of 643 days, but we managed to overcome numerous challenges that we faced with the supplier. The teams worked diligently to find solutions to meet our client's needs. I want to express my gratitude for the incredible contribution made by everyone involved. Thank you!\n\n62#thank you|Catriona, I would really like to thank you for jumping on a call with me yesterday to go through the TP before I posted it. This helped me in having the correct journals booked.\n\n63#NO(r)WAY = YES  WAY!|a HUGE thank you to all of you who were involved getting Sparco Norway over the line. There were many ups and downs to making this happen, but if it wasn't for all of you and your determination to give the customer the best experience, this would have never happened. so THANK YOU one last time :)\n\n64#Spark from Fidelity!|Catriona, this Spark comes directly from our partners at Fidelity! Julie from Fidelity said that she very much appreciated you taking a meeting with them to follow-up on some time-sensitive tax questions while you were on vacation, and also mentioned that she finds you \"lovely to work with\"! Here's a quote from her: \"Catriona, I am eternally grateful for your time and truly appreciate your partnership here. Please share those with whom you enjoy your holiday my sincerest apologies for interrupting and gratitude for their accommodation of this request as well.\" Personally, I also want to thank you for taking this meeting, as it allowed us to unblock multiple workstreams of the project!\n\n65#Thank you|I just want to thank you Catriona for your expertise and time you have invested in guiding me through implementing Enhanced Reporting for our Irish payroll. Your guidance on strategy for the implementation was so helpful. You know all the right questions to ask and are so generous with your time and knowledge. I am so grateful to be lucky enough to get to work with you on these type of projects.\n\n66#Sales Tax GS Code Validation|Catriona & Stephen - the close collaboration and continuous decision-making put into selecting, evaluating, and reviewing the Sovos GS Codes is greatly appreciated. As codes were selected, Stephen would evaluate them manually in Sovos and you both would review and compare with the test results produced by the APIs. With so many competing priorities throughout the business, your support and time throughout this validation process was invaluable. This brings us one step closer to the Sovos UAT signoff and releasing the Cert Manager and GTD Service to production - a pivotal step for the overall project. Thank you for your support.\n\n67#Big Buy Ireland Expansion Determination|I just wanted to say a huge thank you for helping get the big buy Ireland expansion over the line. I know it wasn't easy with the intrastat returns piece coming up, but working together we were able to find a solution and make it happen. Once again I really appreciate all your hard work and patience as we worked through this expansion!\n\n68#Tax & Invoicing Superstars!|Catriona and Jennie, thank you both so much for taking the time to join a call with Fidelity this week to go over some of their tax and invoicing questions! They had a lot of specific concerns, and are certainly knowledgeable about various financial statutes and challenges globally, so the questions they asked were WAY above my head! I appreciated the care you took in answering as simply as possible, and I could tell that Julie was much more confident about her internal path forward at the end of our discussion. Way to show real respect for our customers!\n\n69#James closes National Grid for $17,390,000|I have the privilege of working alongside James every day, and his success is no surprise. His work ethic, his hunger and can-do attitude, his dedication to getting better, his ability to build trust and credibility, his team approach and his capability of challenging in the most charming way are just some of the ways I see James shine.   James, I hope I say this enough to you – I think you are brilliant, and I feel privileged to work with you.   A stellar team is behind an outcome like this and there are many people to thank.   Michael Robb took the lead on crafting a powerful response to their monster  RFP and pulled in all the various SMEs for their expertise – Orlagh  dealt with NGs complex Infosec requirements, along with Mindi and Amanda who solved some  challenging YOS requirements,  Chuck took  the lead on our fee proposal and Catriona on some thought-provoking tax questions!   During our finalist presentation, NG shared that we were a ray of light after a day of other vendor presentations - Lynette, Weichen & Rich were outstanding, and they were helped by Lisa and Brian who created a powerful demo site.   The contracting process started in June and was led by Julia. She did an amazing job and once she had more important matters to focus on (a baby)  Hillary and Christie jumped in – they had the unusual situation of only ever being allowed to talk to Procurement, but regardless, the amount of effort they invested was incredible and they always found a solution. NG also insisted on us using their paperwork to which they were adverse to changing in any way  which made for some challenging conversations and a huge thanks to Tom L, Tom V, Nick and Chris for their  guidance, and the many meetings we all had to enable today to happen.   It takes a lot of effort from so many people to win a client of this magnitude, THANK YOU all!!   James – we are thrilled for you.\n\n70#Taxing Times|Before I finish up I wanted to wish you all the best. Catriona since we started on the same day in Workhuman you have succeeded in building out a tax team and got the recognition with your recent promotion The Workhuman Tax team have made such strides and for that take a bow, lots of interesting work ahead.  All I can say is best of luck in your future endeavors !  Jenny\n\n71#Thank you for all you do!|In the spirit of World Gratitude Day I wanted to reach out and say thank you for all your support for the past 2 years. We've done so much together just this year, having sat through hours of workshops understanding all the requirements for sales tax, and then supporting the understanding if the solution proposed is going to be acceptable and now going through final stages of development and testing. It's been a rollercoaster but a fun one because you made it so. Thank you for everything!\n\n72#AlphaTax / IRL tax compliance|Catriona, Tremendous work on setting up Alpha Tax to allow the Company to file its Ireland tax returns on an annual basis without the need of a third-party accounting firm to file on our behalf.  Your attention to detail to ensure the system works not only in this first year but in subsequent years sets us up for tremendous efficiencies going forward (and saving the money we otherwise would have to pay to EY is a big bonus)!\n\n73#Statutory accounts|Catriona thanks for all your help with the statutory accounts. Gone are the days when I used to have to spend an inordinate amount of time preparing tax notes. You have taken this on and brought it to a whole new level with detailed workbooks now in place to support all disclosures. You were also so timely in responding to audit queries, some of which you had to react swiftly to as responses were needed \"yesterday\".. The statutory accounts are a significant undertaking and your contribution was key to ensuring we met our deadlines.\n\n74#Finding the FNAC|Just wanted to thank all of you for the great work that was put into getting one of our latest new gift card providers over the line. Nat, it's taken so much of your time chasing back & forth but your determination and language skills ensured we were face to face with the right contacts when it mattered. Ali & Catriona, thank you both so much for your patience in explaining in detail to the supplier the requirements that were essential for us to successfully partner. And thank you also to Francesca & Natasha for supporting the many queries that came from this. Great teamwork all round!\n\n75#SALES TAX EXPERTS|A big thank you for all your work in 2023 on the Sales Tax provision.

I want to recognise the hard work each of contributed to, firstly getting this process up and running, and secondly delivering accurate numbers within quarter end close deadlines. Thank you for your enthusiasm, positive attitude and teamwork to get where we are today. Well done!\n\n76#2022 Audit|A huge thank you to everybody for all the hard work associated with the 2022 EY financial audit. This is one of the key deliverables of the finance team and after a long couple of months, we are finally seeing coming towards a conclusion. This year saw a number of other competing projects – Corporation tax audit, testing for the upcoming Epicor upgrade, the unplanned work associated with banking operations to name a few…..but even with these competing priorities, you all demonstrated great focus and tenacity to ensure audit tasks were closed out as efficiently and timely as possible. There was a significant amount of information requested from listings to reconciliations to sample selections and then queries and more requests! While this seemed never ending at times, you all continued to deliver. It is great achievement to be at this stage of the audit and we can now start to put it behind us. Great work and well done all!\n\n77#Process Impact Workshops|Thank you for your time, your active participation and sharing your knowledge and valuable insight.

We aligned on ownership and immediate next steps to continue progressing this initiative.  I wanted to say thank you for everything you do!\n\n78#For all your help building Experiences!|Team - A sincere thank you to this broad cross-functional group that has banded together over the past 6 months to get us to the point where we're ready to launch Experiences for our customers.  It has been quite the journey from the \"we're going to build this\" stage to where we are today.  I can honestly say that it took every single one of you to get us where we are today.  From the small roles when we were in a pinch to the big roles of PMing the day-to-day (Susan + Linda!), every task and responsibility was vital to getting us to this point.  There was a lot of learning, ups and downs, and changes in course, but through it all this group stayed steadfast in the pursuit to build a great additional way for our users to redeem their points for something meaningful.  This has been the most impressive collaboration across so many teams that I've seen at my time at Workhuman - and that was only possible because of the fantastic humans involved.  I know that this disrupted many roadmaps and strategic plans, but through all of it you all gave your full attention to the work at hand and lended all of your collective experience to navigate a windy road and ultimately build a great solution.  Thank you for the hard work, dedication, and perseverance through the past 6 months - I can't wait to see it live and in action soon!  I'm eternally grateful for this group and look forward to continue building the future of Experiences as we get rolling.  THANK YOU!\n\n79#Tax Guru|Catriona - this recognition is long overdue (I didn't want to jinx it before we know for sure we can put this issue to rest :)  I can not thank you enough for that herculean task you've accomplished to support Juniper with their India tax request. Back in September, you jumped to help and I am so grateful for EVERYTHING you did for them.  From dozens of joint calls and numerous emails, you provided all the necessary information and then some.  I admire your attention to detail, the meticulous care you showed to Juniper and your fellow humans, and your wealth of knowledge when it comes to taxes. Just a couple of weeks ago we finally executed the amendment and provided all the documents they needed so Juniper can finally pay the rest of their Indian invoices - all because of your support.

Certainly you 2 have broken the mold of the 'traditional Tax experts' as I had a lot of fun talking about tax ?????  How is that even possible - I am still wondering about that.  I think this is the beginning of a new and great collaboration that is going to deliver significant benefits to all of us (internal and external) that are involved in the Onboarding process.  So massive thanks for your commitment to the cause.\n\n126#Prize distribution|Thank you, Doug, Catriona, Liz, Kerri, and Jillian for your help in understanding the prize rules for our Workhuman Innovation program, related to two contractors who were on the first place winning team. A few emails, and a very productive phone call, which was so informative and helpful in being able to resolve the choices these winners had, and resolve delivery of their prizes! Thanks so much to each of you for your help working through this and educating me along the way.\n\n127#Truly Amazing Teamwork!!!|After working for something for such a long period of time, it's fun to look back and think of all the little steps along the way that got you to the finish line.  We recently were able to bring Seagate into the Workhuman Family, and it wouldn't have been possible without this amazing group of individuals helping make it a reality.  Thank you all for your support throughout this incredible journey, which includes - prep for meetings, meetings, custom demo's, marketing campaigns, a micro-site, more meetings, more demos, value creation sessions, Workhuman Live Speakers, RFP preparation and submission, a trip to Denver, references, finalist presentations, follow up meetings, security reviews, pricing discussions, negotiations, and I'm sure a few more that I can't even remember.  It takes a herculean effort to bring in a new customer on board, and you are all truly appreciated...thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\n\n128#L'Occitane SPV or not??!|Catriona, a little late but thank you for joining the L'Occitane meeting, making sure that VAT is being applied correctly. Your knowledge on Vat rules and regulations is amazing and I feel like I already learned a lot just listening to you for those few minutes.

Thank you so much from the Internal Vendor Expansion team\n\n131#Super Support|Thank you so much for your help in getting M&S digital over the line in Q4. Catriona & Natasha, I really appreciate your help in taking the time out to jump on calls to assist the supplier with the many invoice queries they had.

Have a great Christmas and I look forward to what 2022 will bring.\n\n133#What a Marvel-ous Team!!!|There's always that time when you are preparing for THE meeting that's going to matter, and it's essential to have a team that you know will deliver for that specific future customer.  When I look at the image in this award, that's how it felt walking/zooming into our presentation.  Marc and Hari - you've been with me throughout this journey, and your support going into this meeting was great as usual.  Always providing thought provoking ideas to help me fine-tune the finished product, and taking the time to make sure we were dialed in for a 7:30am delivery on a Monday morning.  Meisha-ann and Naomi, wow...just wow!!!  Every time we work together, I'm simply grateful for each of you for both the expertise and confidence you display to those that are considering Workhuman as a partner.  Nuvs, you have become a specialist of sorts with many superpowers.  Having your insights and connection to different elements of our product, as well as what our future has it store allows for us to answer each question they throw our way.  Chris and Catriona, this one was unique as there were so many people from the finance team that were slated to be part of this discussion.  It was the right time to bring you into the conversation, and when called upon you delivered the kind of message they needed to hear.  I hope to be able to deliver some good news soon, and can't thank you enough for helping put us in the position to win over Seagate's hearts and minds, and soon become part of the Workhuman family.  You are all truly appreciated!!!\n\n134#VAT clarifications|Thank you all for organising today's call and giving us some insight into the main VAT points to consider when sharing the invoice requirements with our suppliers.  Thanks for creating and sharing the invoice template with the different options and requirements which will be extremely useful for our onboarding process.  Enjoy your award.\n\n135#Tax-manian Devil|Catriona, I just wanted to recognise all your advice on some recent VAT queries. We are starting to see a rise in these and it's great to have someone with your knowledge to bounce these off. You happily have lended your time for a recent vendor call which was really helpful on both sides. Your expertise has been a great value add to Finance. Thank you.\n\n136#Tax roll forward|Graham and Catriona thanks for working together to complete the tax roll forward on work day 2. This is way ahead of our normal timeline and really shows what can be achieved with effective planning, frontloading and collaboration. Catriona you proactively updated the schedule for July and August ahead of close in order to limit the workload at quarter end. Graham you prioritized the revaluations for tax accounts as a work day 2 item, so Catriona could get ahead and close out the roll forward. This is a nice win and another step in the right direction to reducing our close timelines.\n\n137#Statutory Accounts – Done!|Fantastic work in closing out the 2020 Statutory Accounts. This is another major milestone to have accomplished. A huge amount of time and work was involved over the last number of months in getting this over the line from preparing workpapers and roll-forwards, calculating statutory adjustments, preparing reconciliations back to the US GAAP financials, addressing audit requests and queries and finally going through three separate EY partner reviews. This would not have been achieved without great teamwork, determination, focus and attention to quality. Well done everybody in completing this and ensuring all our deadlines were met.\n\n138#Collaboration at its best!|Catriona, I wanted to take the time to recognize how incredibly generous you have been with your time to join calls, answer questions and provide insight into the MANY queries that have arisen of late regarding our approach to onboarding merchandise partners in India and China. It's a learning curve for us all for sure and it feels like we are approaching a stage where the road ahead is becoming more clear! Thank you, your help is greatly appreciated!\n\n139#Big Week|Catriona, this was a critical week for compliance with many deliverables. Thanks in no small part to your expertise and guidance we met all our deadlines. Your input to the completion of form 46G was greatly appreciated. We now have a template that will save us considerable time going forward with future returns. With the growth in WH there are many added taxation complexities. It gives us all great reassurance with you at the helm supporting and directing us to ensure we are compliant with all tax returns.\n\n140#Tax Expert and Contract Closer !|Catriona, thank you so much for the tax advice you provided in closing our most recent deal! Having just joined Workhuman you weren't hesitant to jump right in and I appreciate that so much.  You jumped onto a client call, heard their concerns, evaluated their language, reached out to our SME tax partners to research a new tax issue, and speedily redlined, commented and revised all while working with me and sales to coordinate with the client and their needs.  It was such a pleasure working with you and your positive, thoughtful, can-do attitude (and a bonus- getting to know you better in the process!) I look forward to working with you more on these and can't thank you enough for your dedication in closing this deal so swiftly!!\n\n141#collaboration, communication and determination|Catriona, i wanted to take a moment to recognize you for the quality of your collaboration, communication and determination. we have been engaging quite a bit over the past month and it has been a pleasure to work with you and see the energy you bring. i have no doubt we are moving an a good direction and bit by bit we will have a complete understanding of WHT, The potential impact in wider regions and how we mitigate impacts were possible going forward. Thank you.\n\n142#Welcome onboard!|Hi Catriona, you just arrived in the Company and you have made already such a big difference for the AP team.

Over the past few weeks, the Architecture team has involved this team in over 120 hours of meetings as we looked to understand the pain points with the current process.    Everyone across the Finance, Operations, GBGS , Fin Dev and DBA teams was incredibly helpful and supportive over the last few weeks,  taking time out of your schedules during an intensive period to answer our questions.   Given the complexity of the process,  we required multiple sessions with members of this group to wrap our heads around this process, with this team demonstrating remarkable patience and enthusiasm to articulate the challenges faced.   We have emerged from the process with the utmost respect for the exemplary work this group does and a commitment to help address these challenges .   Thank you all again for your time and dedication.\n\n144#Made Your Mark!|Thanks so much for all your help and guidance recently, Catriona. You have only been with us a couple of months but made a huge impact already. Your ability to impart knowledge so clearly in such a niche area is a credit to you and I am really looking forward to working with you & learning more.... and of course meeting you in person one day!\n\n145#Adding value left, right and centre|Catriona, you have truly hit the ground running and are adding value to everything you touch showing us the importance of having you on our team.

You have been of immense support with tax notes for statutory accounts and with preliminary corporation tax. It gives so much peace of mind knowing that we now have an in-house go to tax specialist. You have a wonderful attitude and are always there to give advice when needed. It really has been an education working with you to date.\n\n148#To claim or not to claim|Hi Catriona - only in the door but already blowing us away with your knowledge. This award is to thank you for the work you done on resolving if a particular cost was claimable for tax purposes, you even got on a call with legal to follow thru. In doing so we can be sure our CT is as clean as possible. Thanks and enjoy!\n\n149#UK Stats-Tax|Catriona, thank you so much for reviewing and adding on clear calculations in UK Stats word doc and excel workings in the Tax workings to backup the adjustments made and also for adding on an explanation to each.
