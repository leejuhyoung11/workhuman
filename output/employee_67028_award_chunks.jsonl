"0#Overdue Thank you|Hi Conor, I just wanted to take a moment to say Thank you so much for your support lately with my Bank issues. I know how busy you must be, but you still took the time to sort out the BOI app and my user account for me, enabling me to make payments without delay. This is very much appreciated.\n\n1#Strategy Planning Superstars|Thank you all for the incredible effort and collaboration you brought to the accelerated enterprise capability maturity and planning work this year. The Finance team’s attention to detail, thoughtful engagement, and willingness to lean into this new approach made a huge difference. You took the time to deeply understand the framework, challenge where needed, and deliver high-quality inputs that made consolidation seamless and the final Finance view truly strong. I really appreciate your partnership and commitment throughout. Thank you!\n\n2#Thank You for Your Incredible Help This Quarter!|I just wanted to take a moment to recognize all the amazing support you’ve given me especially during this QE. You’ve all been incredible, jumping in to help with everything from reclasses and Opex, COGS,  questions to credit card queries, employee expenses, urgent payments, last minute approvals, you name it! You’ve taken the time to walk me through processes, double-check details, and make sure things ran smoothly, even when you had plenty on your own plates. Thanks so much for all your effort, teamwork, and kindness. It’s a real pleasure working with you all! Enjoy!\n\n3#Lead & Lift|Conor, I want to take a moment to recognise the incredible support and guidance you’ve given me over the past few months. With so many moving parts in AP, projects, expansions, BAU, efficiencies, you’ve been there at every step, offering advice, support, and genuinely looking out for our best interests. I truly appreciate your leadership. Thank you.\n\n4#Excellence in Action|As we wrap up Q3, I want to take a moment to celebrate a group of outstanding humans who have created incredible momentum across the business. This quarter you've shown what it means to have Respect for Quality - working across teams, delivering high-quality work, all while staying focused on what matters most: our mission to make work human. Your commitment to Inspire the HR Industry has shone through in the many accomplishments across the organization. As we head into the final quarter of the year, I’m filled with optimism about what we’ll continue to achieve together. Thank you for your hard work, your passion, and your commitment!\n\n5#Sharepoint storage collaboration|Conor, A few months ago, we began discussing SharePoint storage usage across the Finance team sites. You took the initiative to analyze the situation and consult with your teams, and about four weeks ago, you returned with a set of rigorous retention requirements and strict storage limits. Based on your recommendations, I implemented the following policies: Reduced version history from the default 50 versions to 10. Configured retention to keep only items from the past 90 days. Once these policies were in place, it took some time for older versions to age out. Now that the aging process has completed, the results have been remarkable: Storage usage dropped from over 7 TB to just over 1 TB. The previously largest site is now the 6th largest. These outcomes far exceeded my expectations. Thank you for your diligence and collaboration throughout this process. Your clear and decisive requirements made a significant impact.\n\n6#Celebrating Our Teamwork  – ITGC Review 2025|As we wrap up the ITGC Review 2025, I want to sincerely thank each of you for your outstanding support throughout this process. Your guidance, the timely sharing of supporting documents, clarification of processes, and confirmation of our understanding and observations were all crucial to the success of this review. Your collaboration and commitment have been truly appreciated. I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity to continue working together and look forward to our future collaboration with great optimism.\n\n7#Thank You|Thanks Conor for completing the Digital Cert renewal for India. I know renewing this cert is not for the faint hearted, especially when it involves a number of external stakeholders in the process, plus different times zones etc.. The good news is you won't need to do it for 2 years :) Thanks again for your help on this. Much appreciated.  Enjoy the award.\n\n8#Minimum Commitment quality support|I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for your support with the Minimum Commitments. Your valuable feedback and insights have been instrumental in helping us keep track and manage customers effectively. I truly appreciate your collaboration and effort, and I look forward to continuing to work together.\n\n9#Workiva End User Engagement!|A huge thanks to all our business process control owners and preparers for your engagement with the internal control testing and assurance programme through Workiva! We have come a long way from go-live; from learning how to navigate the tool, providing useful feedback on improvements/dashboard, to now fully engaging in the tool and allowing us to systemise our end to end control management & assurance program. This wouldn't be possible without your continued engagement in responding to quarterly assessments, process doc updates, evidence requests and issue remediation tasks! Looking forward to building on this for H2! Thank you!\n\n10#2024 Audit Signed!|Last week, we received the signed audit report for the 2024 year-end financials—a major milestone for the finance team. I want to sincerely thank each of you for your contributions in achieving this. Supporting the year-end audit is no small feat. It involves a tremendous amount of work—from preparing initial listings, schedules, and balance sheet reconciliations to handling countless sample requests and addressing follow-up queries. At times, the requests felt endless! Throughout the process, your commitment to both quality and timeliness was clear. EY were very complementary on the collaboration between the two teams, which is a reflection of your professionalism and dedication. It’s a great achievement to have this completed and behind us for another year. Thank you all once again for your hard work. Excellent job and well done!\n\n11#Op Excellence, AI mustaches and twins for the win|Team! It was so great to spend some with all of you over the past week to start ironing out some parameters around what it means to be \"most excellent\" operationally across a handful of lanes. I thought our discussions were productive, action oriented, honest, and thought provoking. I enjoyed talking about short term, low cost options we could charge against, while balancing a longer term view of what excellent can look like, and what would need to happen to get there. It was also a treat to meet Mark's less Irish sounding twin... he seems cool, but I still think I like the real Mark better. Lastly, a special shout out for Hillary for raising her hand as captain and harnessing her ppt skills ;-)\n\n12#Master Data Aligned!|Dear Team, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to all the stakeholders involved in the Master Data project, particularly in aligning cost centers, departments, functions, and supervisory organizations. It’s hard to believe that for so many years, the business struggled to align these critical components across Workday, Epicor, Concur, and Spark.  Your hard work, collaboration, and unwavering dedication have been instrumental in achieving this significant milestone. Each of you has played a vital role in aligning our systems, and this foundational piece stands as a testament to your collective efforts.  Today, we have successfully aligned all systems—Workday, Epicor, Concur, and Spark—along with measures built within Workday to maintain the integrity of the structure. Additionally, a RACI is now in place, ensuring clear roles and responsibilities across the board.  This is a crucial foundation that will pave the way for future projects, such as the Workday-Payroll integration and security restructuring. None of this would have been possible without your leadership, commitment, and collaborative spirit. Thank you!\n\n13#Just a moment|I’d like to take a moment to express my belated gratitude for your hard work during this busy period, particularly while handling numerous audit requests alongside the transition to the new banking transfer system. Thanks to your help, advice, and dedication, we’ve been able to deliver exceptional service to our Irish, EU, and worldwide suppliers without any delays. This is a true reflection of our collaboration and professionalism. Please find a minute to celebrate this achievement on our Work Appreciation Day!\n\n14#Risk control on the up, thanks to you!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your exceptional efforts and dedication in managing our business internal controls throughout 2024. Your commitment to excellence and proactive approach have been instrumental in fostering and growing our internal control culture.  In particular, I would like to extend a special thank you to our Control Owners for taking ownership of their controls and providing invaluable input into improving our business internal controls. Your insights and contributions have significantly enhanced our processes and helped mitigate risks effectively.  We have come a long way, but there is still some work to be done. I am confident that with your continued dedication and support, we will get there together.  I also want to acknowledge the vital part our Control Preparers play in this process. Your diligence and hard work in ensuring the smooth implementation and ongoing success of our controls are truly appreciated.  Once again, thank you for going above and beyond in 2024. I look forward to continuing to work alongside you in 2025 and achieving even greater success together. Our risk control efforts are stronger than ever, thanks to you!\n\n15#Great leadership!|Thank you Conor for the wonderful leadership you have shown over the past year. You have guided us on how to build out and deliver on our goals, provide a great balance of challenge and autonomy, always supportive and empowering us to do our best!

I look forward to working with you all in 2025\n\n20#Dream Team|I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to each of you for the incredible support and encouragement you’ve shown me since I stepped into my new role this year. Every one of you has played a key role in my journey so far, whether by guiding me on people and processes or sharing valuable advice along the way.

Thanks a lot, Shmulik\n\n22#Revenue Audit CLOSED!|All, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the massive contribution provided to help bring this revenue audit to a conclusion. It has taken nearly three years of correspondence and negotiations with the revenue to reach an agreement. Revenue audits involve a significant amount of people’s time and continues dedication, which can have a significant impact on people’s day-to-day jobs.

Thanks to all of you I feel like i'm much better informed and instructed in how the good ship, The SS Workhuman moves forward. I've had the privileged opportunity of moving roles quite a few times in the past, and whilst you always hear 'Put some time in with me', 'anything I can do to help', the people in this organization, do not just say, but they live by that value.  I'm incredibly grateful for all of your support, input, time & guidance, and I look forward to the time when I can return the favor, and begin to be the source of answers for some of your own questions as we turbocharge this freighter together!\n\n25#Appreciate your session on Pricing and Billing|Dear Conor,  Thank you for the excellent session on Pricing and Billing at Workhuman.

The situation was undoubtedly demanding, yet the collective effort to swiftly address and mitigate the issue was remarkable. The ability to come together, assess the potential impact, explore viable solutions, and implement a fix ensured that our quarter-end close could proceed as planned. The level of communication maintained throughout was exemplary, and so important in navigating these hurdles. On the AR team, the shift from our scheduled routine to an improvised approach was handled flawlessly –  the minimal customer inquiries regarding the delayed invoices speaks volumes about the effectiveness of how the issue was handled. On the FA & Tax front, the unwavering flexibility and teamwork were instrumental in steering us through the Close, culminating in a successful quarter-end process.

Thank you again; I truly appreciate your support and willingness to help.\n\n28#Quicksight Reporting Success|I want to say a big thank you to each person who contributed to the publication of the first Quicksight Revenue Reports to Production. This is a massive milestone for both the Fin Dev and Finance teams and took a tremendous amount of teamwork to get here. The journey began in 2022 when the Daily Batch Revenue Recognition Project kicked off, upgrading from a previous monthly run. The was released in June 2023 and laid the building blocks for the production of Quicksight Revenue Reports, with daily data population. From there Fin Dev and Finance worked together to explore opportunities for various reporting requirements across Revenue and Awards. We have had countless workshops, meetings, messages, emails exchanges and much more to share ideas, requirements around source data, content, definitions, calculations, format, structure, visuals, improvements, the list is endless. I’m delighted that we have now released the first two reports to Production, with a number more in development. The benefits of the automation of these reports include time saving efficiencies, quality control, removal of risk of manual error and the ability for daily refresh. The building blocks in the development of the domain and core models also opens the door for endless opportunity and efficiencies in further report development. Thank you for your ideas, collaboration, out of the box thinking, teamwork and all-round enthusiasm in this space. Well done to all involved!\n\n29#2023 Audit - Done!!!!|A huge thank you to everyone for all your work during the 2023 year-end financial audit. The completion of the annual audit is one of the key milestones for the finance team. A target was set of having the audit completed in record time this year – yesterday this target was achieved with the receipt of EY’s signed audit report which sets a record for earliest completion of the audit and issuance of the financial statements – a fantastic achievement! Each one of you delivered in order to reach this milestone – providing listings & reconciliations, preparing schedules, accounting memos, detailed explanations, attending meetings, jumping on calls, pulling samples, addressing queries…….the list goes on. While going through an audit can be frustrating and seem never ending at times, you all demonstrated remarkable commitment, teamwork and urgency in ensuring that all of EY’s requests and follow up queries were closed out efficiently and timely. It’s great that we can now start Q2 with the audit behind us. Great work all and well done!\n\n30#Investing in our new talent.|An award i have been meaning to put through for some time and that a big thank you for the time invested in finding the right talent during the hiring process for the open role within the AR collections team at year end. i know a lot of work was done to comb through the market review candidates and set up interviews. there is then the time invested in conducting the interviews during what was a super busy period of the year as we approached the end of year. Thank you for your collaboration from providing feedback on the candidates and being a soundboard for me as i created the rec and put thought into the required personnel to fill the roll, it was great that we were all on the same page and ultimately in agreement on the chosen candidate. getting it all tied up prior to the Xmas break to have our new hire start in the new year was super impressive and important as we had further time consuming activities taking place in Q1 that required focus.\n\n31#Bringing 2024 Strategy Alive!|I would like to thank each of you for your enthusiasm to participate, creating and delivering engaging content to bring elements of the global strategy board alive.

There's been numerous projects we've worked on where your collaboration has been fundamental in helping us achieve our goals. From introducing Experiences earlier into the year, shifting the monthly batch RevRec to daily, and then of course the US Sales Tax project. These and other projects have required plenty of input and UAT from yourselves which is a big ask when you have to make time outside of your main duties. It's also been an interesting year for production issues, not always of our making of course but you have been very patient and helpful as we worked on resolving them. Thanks again from FinDev!\n\n34#Statutory Accounts|Conor thanks for all your help with the statutory accounts. You made yourself available to attend weekly calls where as always you added so much value. You were so sensitive to the time sensitivity of getting these approved at the August board, that you used your influence to ensure all third party dependencies were delivered. You also took on some of the more technical disclosures that would have been a stretch for me to close out. The statutory accounts are a significant undertaking and we couldn't have got over the line without your support, expertise and guidance.\n\n35#Know your customer|Conor, thanks for all your help with KYC queries from RBS. You went out of your way to go on calls with the bank and provide all the information they required. You also provided regular updates on progress.

Lynette, well done on guiding Sanofi's strategy and change management for their new global program and the relationship building you have done along the way with the core and wider teams at Sanofi.

Huge congrats and thank you to you all again for your contributions to this client launch.\n\n38#Big Ask = Big Response|A staff DSAR is never a simple ask when they have access to so many systems and we deal with so much of their personal data. When you get 7 in the same timeframe it is one big lift. Thanks to each of you in the business areas who dug into your files and your email to assist with this request. Thank you to the HX teams who had to dig into their own files as well as those of former colleagues and for multiple people - I know it was a mammoth task. A bit thank you to Simona and Liam who supported this effort from infosec side, reviewing every piece of data on all requests and removing the data of other users! I know there were times when we didn't think we would get through this but we did!! Thank you all.\n\n39#Super stakeholders|Steve, both Conors, Tara, Kevin and Martin.   Thank you all for being such super stakeholders to work with over the past decade. Your help has been invaluable explaining accounting policies and helping mapping them into algorithms and processes that the FinDev team can implement. You've frequently engaged with me in straw-man discussions to explore layers of requirements and evaluate different approaches - while kept room for fun.  It has been a great pleasure to work with you for the past decade - and I'll miss the tech challenges in my retirement. I wish you all every success in building a B€10 company, with smoothly automated financial processes leading to an easy life!\n\n40#2022 Audit|A huge thank you to everybody for all the hard work associated with the 2022 EY financial audit. This is one of the key deliverables of the finance team and after a long couple of months, we are finally seeing coming towards a conclusion. This year saw a number of other competing projects – Corporation tax audit, testing for the upcoming Epicor upgrade, the unplanned work associated with banking operations to name a few…..but even with these competing priorities, you all demonstrated great focus and tenacity to ensure audit tasks were closed out as efficiently and timely as possible. There was a significant amount of information requested from listings to reconciliations to sample selections and then queries and more requests! While this seemed never ending at times, you all continued to deliver. It is great achievement to be at this stage of the audit and we can now start to put it behind us. Great work and well done all!\n\n41#End Of Qtr. Ops & Finance Collaborators!|All, thank you for your time, inputs, and support on the regular end of quarter meetings as Q1’ 23 came to a very successful close. Q1 2023 proved to be yet another record-breaking quarter for the business! With billings increasing by $20M +, and redemptions increasing by $15M + Year over Year for Quarter 1. The regular end of quarter meetings provides an excellent platform for the teams to communicate how the business is preforming vs forecast, highlight any potential risks and enable continued communication and collaboration across the teams ensuring that we are all aligned in our common goal - successfully delivering an exceptional employee experience globally, while also meeting the business goals and successfully hitting our many KPI's targets. As we are all well aware this type of success does not happen by itself or when teams are working in isolation, it really does take a village to continue to successfully deliver at this scale. Thanks again for your support and collaboration, Enjoy!\n\n42#Support|I just wanted to call out the stellar support you have all provided and continue to provide while we navigate through the new process of making payments. We have had quick turnarounds, templates, and payments created on the fly, all of which you've given urgency to do and, in turn, have enabled us to get payments out as quickly as possible. Your support and advice during this time are so appreciated. Thank you!\n\n43#End of Year Meetings Ops & Finance Collaborators!|All, thank you for your time, inputs and support on the regular end of year meetings as 2022 came to a very successful close.

The regular end of quarter/year meetings provide an excellent platform for the teams to communicate how the business is preforming vs forecast, highlight any potential risks and enable continued communication and collaboration across the teams ensuring that we are all aligned in our common goal - successfully delivering an exceptional employee experience globally, while also meeting the business goals and successfully hitting our many KPI's targets. As we are all well aware this type of success does not happen by itself or when teams are working in isolation, It really does take a village to continue to successfully deliver at the scale we now find ourselves at! Thanks again for your support and collaboration, looking forward to working closely together throughout 2023 to see how many more records will be broken!  Enjoy!\n\n44#Process & Controls Finance Milestone!|Well done everyone for all your work over the past number of months in identifying our key controls, learning how to record evidence and most recently in working through the validation testing with Yvonne to ensure that we're operating the controls effectively. Starting something new is never easy but you have all been a instrumental in making sure that we're managing risk for WH and in helping us move toward a controls based audit for 2023. Looking forward to continuing the controls journey with you all into next year! Have a wonderful Christmas!!\n\n45#Cash Stars!|Hi team,  I just wanted to take a moment to recognize you all for your work on the CashStar order forms. This award, to me, is the definition of Respect for Teamwork. Not only do we have representatives from 3 different teams involved, but everyone played a role in getting this issue solved. I'll admit, as the E-comm rep, I probably did a minimal amount of work. Jason & Lynn, I'm glad that you brought this to my attention.  Conor, thank you for the helpful suggestion. Hillary & Emily, thank you for clarifying everything about why we set this up and for then for creating a new order form. Finally, thank you Jason & Kevin for reviewing. Go, team!  Side note: My award images get lost on a lot of people. Who you are looking at is the Cash Money Records roster. Instrumental in defining Southern Rap.\n\n46#Support|Conor, I would like to thank you for all the support you have given me on the Insurance claim for damage to the 4th floor.

Rollout/training/LIVE!!!!|Team,  What momentum!! Over the last several weeks, you came together and completed the rollout of the Concur Expense Program in EMEA to align with US. This aligns with new Global Travel and Expense Policy we established a few weeks ago as well. The roll out included specific training to key groups – EAs, people leader, and all employees! I am so proud of the collaboration within teams to upgrade, configure, deploy and communicate the rollout. This completes the Concur project launch - one that will be key for Workhuman to scale well beyond our 1,000+ employee count! Thank you all!!!\n\n49#Finance Capability Mapping|All - I just want to say a massive thank you for providing your time to map out & score Workhuman's Finance capabilities. I know a commitment of time, but one that will pay off.    This exercise  really did help articulate what the Finance team do in Workhuman today, what we need to do in the future, and a heat map of our maturity   All of this will help in driving prioritisation and key investment decisions for next year and beyond\n\n50#Simply Thank You|Hi Team, this is to say a big Thank You to each one of you for the support recently. From looking after my work to the text messages and calls and for showing up in person last week. It's all so appreciated and means more than you know.

Given that the ask came from leftfield,  I've been very impressed with how the team has taken this work and hit the ground running! This initiative will go a long way to strengthening our partnership with IBM who are a very important customer for WorkHuman. We're not there yet and Dec 16th isn't a million miles away! However, with this team of great engineers in Findev Revenue and the supporting cast working on the solution, I'm very confident we will get this over the line!\n\n52#Warm welcome|Thank you both so much for giving Lauren such a warm welcome to Workhuman! She's recently hit her 90 day milestone, and is thrilled to be a part of the WH team. Appreciate everything you do to keep her engaged and feeling like a valued member of the crew :)\n\n53#It takes a team!|All of you contributed in your own way to help celebrate Shane's 20 year anniversary with the company. I wanted to thank all of you for your contributions in making this a very special occasion that I hope Shane will remember for some time. Lynette I am sure Shane will fill you in on all those stories!! Thanks again I appreciate the extra effort everyone made.\n\n54#Thank you for your guidance.|Conor, thanks a lot for your help, guidance and support with the insurance aspect of the water damage to the 4th floor. This was super helpful and certainly put me at ease that we are pursuing this in the right way.  Much appreciated.\n\n55#Finance Transformation Workshops|Thank you all for you contribution to our Finance Transformation Workshops. It was a super busy 3 day schedule where we walked through all things Data, Forecasting & Budgeting and Solution Revenue. We have a comprehensive list of next steps and have a clear go-forward position. Thank you all for your energy and commitment to moving this forward. P.S. Huge thanks for the ice cream and ice-cream cake ... AMAZING!\n\n56#Great support|Conor thanks for your support on multiple fronts lately. You jumped in at short notice to close out admin requirements on Stripe. This enabled us to complete setup and testing for WH Live Dublin registrations. You also helped me get file gateway configured with BOI so we can now process payroll payments across SEPA jurisdictions. I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to move these forward.\n\n57#Audit Complete!|A huge thank you to everybody involved with the 2021 EY Dublin Audit. EY signed off on our 2021 US GAAP financials last Friday – this is a fantastic milestone to have reached and is the culmination of the massive effort and work put in by all. A huge amount of information was requested - detailed listings, reconciliations, sample selections, accounting memos, process documentation, explanations and then more queries and more samples! You all jumped in and delivered all information in a timely manner demonstrating great urgency throughout. Any follow up queries that subsequently came were also promptly addressed. When sample selections crossed multiple finance teams, fantastic teamwork was demonstrated ensuring everything was delivered comprehensively. We are now in a great position with the year end audit firmly behind us. Thanks again to you all for your co-operation and dedication in reaching this milestone – great work all!\n\n58#Finance Team|Just wanted to take a moment to thank my partners in Finance for the warm welcome and for taking the time to meet with me during my first couple of weeks at Workhuman. It was very helpful to understand your roles and teams more as I settle in to my new role and begin building relationships across the organization.\n\n59#Go Team Red!|Thanks to each of you for participating as part of Team Red Handed in Wynwood this week. It was fantastic to team up to tackle these challenges together. We may not have topped the scoreboard, but we beat the heat and got to the finish line first!\n\n60#Executive Presence|Conor, i want to thank you for jumping in last minute and offering to step in on behalf of Jim at such short notice. and you have quite a drive to do that too. Having you there as an executive presence on the day was invaluable and im sure our old and new humans were happy to see you there to open up the Ignite offsite. thanks again, your calm and reassuring prescence was greatly appreciated and i hope you got to enjoy the experience too.\n\n61#Thanks for the support|All of you played different roles but I greatly appreciate all the support you gave...be it vetting the location and advising on the set up, supporting the needs on the day or stepping into the breach in leading the day...at short notice! Thank you all I believe it was a great success and you all contributed and I was sorry to miss it! Next time.\n\n62#Thank you for the support|Conor, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for all the support you have given to me since I joined Workhuman. This award is well overdue :) Since I have joined Workhuman you have given me the opportunity and freedom to work on various tasks/projects and allowed me to put my own stamp on things, which is fantastic and I am greatly appreciative of that. You operate an 'open door policy' whereby I can come to you if I have any questions or need advice/guidance and you are very generous with your time. You have so much knowledge of the business and how it operates at various level (from finance to commercial to operational) which helps me greatly when determining how best to approach a project or task to ensure my methodology aligns across the various functions (e.g. from a tax, finance, commercial and operational perspective). On a personal note, since joining remotely you and the rest of the Finance Team have made me feel very welcomed and part of a team. You have helped build a Finance Team which are friendly, helpful and strive for quality and a great reflection of what Workhuman is all about. I really enjoy working here and thanks for giving me the opportunity.\n\n63#Thank you|Conor, I wanted to take a moment to recognize you for all that you have done this year, particularly the past 6 months. With some team changes happening you made sure that we not only remained connected but established more frequent and meaningful meetings in our calendar. from these i have had the benefit of your time, guidance & Feedback, This has enabled us to move on things quicker than before and keeps us aligned with future goals. Also to have the space to provide what i hope are more meaningful updates to you has been a welcome move weather it be day to day, task/project or personal related. i look forward to the year ahead. Thank you.\n\n64#2021 Gratitude|I just want to show my appreciation for all your help, support and guidance through what has been a year of change and growth, its much appreciated. Giving up so much time for collaboration, analysis, new processes, month end changes - your advice, know-how and time has been invaluable. Thanks and enjoy the award, Sean\n\n65#2021|I just wanted to say thanks for the support this year. This has seemed like the busiest year since I joined and we have had a lot on across the Finance Team. This team is at the heart of all we do in Finance and without each of you the cogs wouldn't keep on turning (pun intended). Even down to the day to day things, like payments or FX, your support is second to none. I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas with your family and look forward to working with you all in 2022.\n\n66#Flexibility on the Fly|Conor and Jim, I appreciate both of you for traveling to Dublin for two days to meet with me in order to solidify our 2022 planning initiatives. I had five days planned in Dublin to spend with you and your teams. But Covid had other plans....so we condensed everything into two days, taking necessary safety precautions, and were able to solidify important plans we need to scale Workhuman in 2022. You both traveled and ensured we were able to cover important topics so we would not fall behind. Thank you for your commitment and teamwork! On to 2022!\n\n67#Sales Orders.....|Thank you both for all of your help, support and guidance with our open sales orders project. Conor this is something you have asked for/suggested for some time now and with the help of Kevin and yourself we worked on creating it over the last 4-6 weeks of Q3. The three of us had numerous calls to make sure we had it right and had everything included. This involved going through all of the billing checklists and trackers for Q3 and adding them to the file and then adding in the invoice numbers to show which was/wasn't billed. This will completely change how we close out Non award activity billing at the end of every month/quarter and will be an integral part of shortening our close also. Without you both this wouldn't have been possible, thank you both and enjoy!\n\n68#Close in 15!!!!!!!!!!!!!|Less than three months ago, I asked a cross-functional team to take on a massive challenge to reduce our quarterly financial by more than 33% within five months. An analogy for this would be like changing the tires of a race car as it rounded the track. In just three months, not only are we well on track to achieve this lofty goal, but we have already created efficiencies and have a terrific plan to tackle the most challenging automation aspect of the plan - well ahead of schedule. I could not be more proud of how this group came together as a team with a passionate focus on achieving this goal and sustaining its impact going forward. I appreciate all of you and thank you. I am grateful to be part of your team, and I cannot wait to celebrate again when we declare victory again....Thank you!\n\n69#Q3 Close and presentations|Hi Conor(s),  Cheers for all your help, especially over the past week in relation to the new fee schedule presentation. You both took the time to go thru and prepare the slides with me and point out a couple of oversights on my behalf which enabled me to create an easy to follow new PP in an easy to digest format for the wider finance team. The little tips and additional pointers were great use to me and will create a great foundation going forward.  Thanks\n\n70#Statutory Accounts – Done!|Fantastic work in closing out the 2020 Statutory Accounts. This is another major milestone to have accomplished. A huge amount of time and work was involved over the last number of months in getting this over the line from preparing workpapers and roll-forwards, calculating statutory adjustments, preparing reconciliations back to the US GAAP financials, addressing audit requests and queries and finally going through three separate EY partner reviews. This would not have been achieved without great teamwork, determination, focus and attention to quality. Well done everybody in completing this and ensuring all our deadlines were met.\n\n71#Another EOQ completed!|Thank you to you all for your attendance and contribution at our EOQ meetings for the last 2 weeks. Our business continues to grow every year, but these meetings somehow get easier and easier! This is a testament to the hard work and preparation that everyone puts in. Special shout out to the folks looking after the floats for really going above and beyond this EOQ too! See you all in 3 months ;)\n\n72#Closing Time|I would like to say a big thank you this group for all your time and effort towards the analysis of the financial close process.   Over the past few weeks, the Architecture team has involved this team in over 120 hours of meetings as we looked to understand the pain points with the current process.    Everyone across the Finance, Operations, GBGS , Fin Dev and DBA teams was incredibly helpful and supportive over the last few weeks,  taking time out of your schedules during an intensive period to answer our questions.   Given the complexity of the process,  we required multiple sessions with members of this group to wrap our heads around this process, with this team demonstrating remarkable patience and enthusiasm to articulate the challenges faced.   We have emerged from the process with the utmost respect for the exemplary work this group does and a commitment to help address these challenges .   Thank you all again for your time and dedication.\n\n73#Help Settling In!!|Team - my sincere thanks to each and every one of you for the wonderful way in which you welcomed me in to the Workhuman family.  Your transparency and support over the course of my first 6 weeks here has been inspirational.  Thank you for helping  me to settle in, settle down and kick my Workhuman journey off in such a fab way!!\n\n74#Allstate's in Good Hands|Thank you for your support in creating an amazing response to Allstate's RFP. It was all hands on deck for this one to ensure we showed Allstate what makes Workhuman such a great strategic partner. This was a big step as we continue through the process with them, and your guidance through some tricky questions helped pave the way for us into the next phase of the discussions. Thank you!\n\n75#It has been a pleasure|Steve and Conor, a massive thank you for all of your support over recent months. In March, we began our search for a tax manager, and to build out a brand new systems team within finance consisting of three new hires. It has been a real pleasure working with you both on all of these roles, your guidance, support, quick responses, and always making time to speak with candidates in a very timely manner ensured we provided amazing hiring experiences for all of our new team members, and ensured we had successful recruitment campaigns. Thank you for everything\n\n76#FUNDING AMAZON|Thanks so much for the last few weeks jumping onto the bank and uploading and approving the extremely large payments we have had for Amazon. With AP limited to a certain approval amounts on SVB we were unable to make the payments. You both had to stand in and get these payments onto the bank and approved in record timing ! Thank you we really appreciate this as it meant a smooth running end to end for our Amazon purchases\n\n77#2020 Audit|A massive thank you to all involved in the 2020 EY Dublin Audit. For a second year running, we have collectively closed this audit while working remotely, which is a fantastic achievement. You have each contributed to this through providing everything from reconciliations to substantive samples, analytics, further sample testing, further explanations,  process docs, memos, accounting policies and general support and guidance to EY. The audit ran smoother than ever with timelines on track throughout and each of you embracing the new EY portal as our main point of tracking and communication. This puts us in a great position with confidence in the quality and accuracy of our Year End Financials, and the processes and controls surrounding them. Thank you for your co-operation, determination and enthusiasm throughout, a fantastic team effort!\n\n78#India & China merch solutions A-team|Thanks to you all for the incredible energy given to our India / China steering committee, over the past 6 months.  This group has turned up to each meeting with bags of innovative thinking, strategic mindsets & lots of determination as we've tried to problem solve ways of working in somewhat equivocal market spaces.  Seeing ahead to future possibilities and translating them into breakthrough strategies seems easier now we're out the other side but it was taken a lot of patience, time, thinking outside the box, team spirit and being open to bouncing around ideas, which may have seemed radical upon initial view but led to great brainstorming and outcomes.  As we now evolve this process to the next stage, appreciate the journey travelled so far with you all - thank you.\n\n79#Visionary for a simpler automated billing future|From Martin:   Conor, I want to express my appreciation for the way that you supported the analysis and solution-design for Bill-on-Redemption, not just for Accenture but for redemption fees in general. Our team is often under pressure to deliver quickly and to do only what is necessary, but you challenged us to go beyond that and to imagine a unified fee solution, and then you gave direction, encouragement and time for that vision to formulate and evolve into a solution. You also got ahead of the Accenture shockwave to allow us to prepare and to calmly work through the complexities without the familiar time-constraints and pressure to size work with lots of uncertainty.  You demonstrated great leadership and you lead by example in accepting the possibility that Accenture might sign contracts, and the redemption fees are now a core part of our business, not just for one or two clients, and you took responsibility for that in making time for us all to prepare. I believe we have all seen the benefit of your foresight and leadership in the comprehensive, thought-out, low-risk solution that we have prepared, and it is also reflected in the calm confidence and pride across the whole team in approaching this work. I thank you for your vision, your collaborative approach, your patience and for having faith in the team.  Sincerely, Martin I echo all of that, and also appreciate your willingness not to be bound by the precedents created by earlier piecemeal manual approaches.   Pete\n\n80#Ops & Finance End of Quarter Meetings|Thanks everyone for attending and contributing during the end of quarter meeting's. With so many variables in the business this forum enables the right decisions to be made at the right time, to ensure smooth end of quarter management while continuing to deliver an exceptional experience to our clients employees!...Another Record Breaking Quarter delivered!!  Thanks again for your support and collaboration. Roll on Q2!!\n\n81#Enterprise Architect Recruitment|Thank you all for your time and commitment to helping us organise and conduct interviews with candidates for an Enterprise Architecture role.   Your feedback throughout the process was invaluable in identifying the best candidate and the positive impressions made helped the candidate realise the excellent culture we have in Workhuman.    Our new hire will be starting in June, so thanks again everyone as I couldn't have done this without you!\n\n82#Great GPTW partnership|Jim, Conor and Ger - A huge thank you for the great partnership to help deliver the GPTW feedback sessions to our people. We really appreciate your collaboration and support to get the right communications ready for our people leaders and employees which was so important to share before 10th March! We know it was another ask while you are really busy but you were happy to jump in and co-facilitate the sessions. Having a representation of the Dublin Executive team as part of the sessions was very powerful and your messages reinforced the positivity, commitment and passion we all share for our wonderful culture. Another great way to create a positive experience for our people. What a year and what results! It was a pleasure to co-deliver with you and we thank you for the partnership! From Christine, Dermot, Caoimhe, Clare and Rosana\n\n83#Team SPARK !|Team SPARK - your involvement in this project has been so extremely important as we reimagine our brand, our product, our strategy, our design, and of course our recognition program. Our spark represents our company and our culture and our people - and you have enriched it to come to life for everyone, everyday. Go Team SPARK!! Enjoy!!g\n\n84#Great Collaboration!|I want to say a huge 'Thank You'  on behalf of GBSG to all of you who were involved with helping us map out the current process for onboarding new Gift Card suppliers. This is such an important process for Workhuman and it spans so many different departments. You all gave so freely of your time and despite this being a busy time for all involved, you were still available to meet at short notice. We are really grateful for your continuing support! Thank you all...\n\n85#A big thank you|Guys, the last 2 weeks have been unbelievably hard for me. I'm so glad that I work with people that kept checking in on me. Ronan, I appreciate all the advice you gave me from when you went through the same thing. Christine, I appreciate the little chats that we had cause I have been being more detached from the world and it really helped me out! And Conor, I appreciate the support you have given me and how you helped the team get through year-end without me, I appreciate the understanding and the little check ins that we have had. You are all amazing and I just want you to know that it meant more to me than you probably realised.\n\n86#Q4 support|Guys,  Cheers for all the support especially in Q4 with the multiple little general tips to help developing files and reports. This has been a huge help in many aspects of my work being able to take these little things and applying these to reconciliations and presentations. The focus on the audience has never been a focus from my point of view but now with the guidance provided I have incorporated this into presentations etc. and this has in-turn (from my point of view) improved the quality and concise nature when for example presenting.  Thanks, Jake\n\n87#Huge Thank You!!!|Hola Conor, this is massive over due THANK YOU for all the support in Twenty-Twenty. You have been there when needed to progress work and personal side.  Welcome to 2021 :)\n\n88#Ops & Finance End Of Quarter Daily's!|All, Just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for their input in the daily end of quarter meeting's during 2020. This daily meeting provides an excellent platform for communicating and sharing insights across the teams from... award and redemption volumes trends,  shifting demand patterns, moves to online and merchandise product, forecast tracking, additional funding requests, team awards and associated planning required, inventory targets, shipping restrictions and potential bottlenecks, backlog management,  Amazon and other float accounts funding requirements, customer re-launches, Billings to redemptions Ratios, new client launches...the list goes on!!  This forum enables the right decisions to be made at the right time, to ensure smooth end of quarter management while continuing to deliver an exceptional experience to our clients employees! Thanks again to everyone for your support throughout the year, wishing you and your family a safe and Happy Christmas ..Roll on 2021!\n\n89#Support and guidance through a challenging year|Conor, a long and overdue thank you for all your support throughout 2020. Firstly, on the personal side, you have been very supportive and understanding with this one-off(hopefully) year that we have had, and always keen to make sure we are getting on ok with the trials and tribulations of COVID . On the work side, we have been making steady progress with all things FP&A and it has been super to have you there to test out our new assumptions and forecasts. Much appreciated!\n\n90#Supporting the Epicor AWS Migration|I wanted to thank each of you for supporting the migration of Epicor to AWS. It takes many folks to clear the way for a project like this, and this really was a cross-functional feast! Whether it was part of our Executive Steering Group, hands on support for the go-live weekend , or supporting key members of the team, you all played an important part in supporting the team to a successful go-live this past weekend.  Thank you for your continued support and commitment to our wonderful cross-functional team,  its very much appreciated.\n\n91#Testing Testing Testing|Hi   I just wanted to say thank you so much for all the time and effort you have shared with the Epicor AWS Migration. Thank you for testing, logging in and verifications done on different environment. Also huge thank you for those employees who logged in over the weekend.  Enjoy\n\n92#Link to the Weekly Activity Report|Conor,  thank you for your quick response last week in sending a sales team member the link to the weekly activity report ! Each quarter I send out the commission statements to the team, and they always  come back with challenging questions about the billings.  The hard part for me is that I can’t provide them with the level of detail they need in order to prove out the numbers for themselves.  By you providing the link helps to solve the problem (for the most part anyway)!  These reports have been a hot topic with the outside sales team lately and your willingness to provide it to him so quickly is appreciated!  Thanks for stepping in and lending a hand! I appreciate it very much!\n\n93#It's TV Time!|Team - I wanted to celebrate your great teamwork, innovation, and sense of urgency to get our TV contracts over the goal line yesterday. This is an exciting new \"first\" foray into test two new media channels for us: Tradition TV and Streaming \"OTT\" (ya you know me). Thank you for your speed, openness, and willingness to work quickly with each other and network partners to hit our deadlines in advance of our first TV commercial tomorrow. With gratitude, -C\n\n94#Amazing teamwork!|Thanks Martin for taking the lead on this and helping out a specific client case for Schneider-Electric on the returning of gift cards from Indonesia. To say it was complex would be putting it mildly but with your expert analytical skills they were put to the test, but you were not alone on this, you had a great team behind you, namely Conor and Tara advised about Rev Rec and clarified the process to minimize accounting entries, Sarah provided details about the returned cards, identifiable redemption order and the stock adjustments, Roberto refunded the identifiable redemption orders and cancelled the credit notes (and was very helpful with good information throughout!!) and finally Elaine created the credit note and checked with the Financial Accountants about the GL coding to use... So I just want to say thankyou to all of you for your great teamwork.\n\n95#Welcome to Workday!|Conor, Jonathan and Mark, thank you for leading from the front by joining our first learning session for managers in the Workday roll out. It was great to have you there, and with one eye on adoption in everything we do right now, it was great for others to see you there too. The team really appreciate your support and wanted to thank you :)\n\n96#the faster the better|Conor, this award is a bit overdue, I would really like to thank you for creating and showing me a report in Fastclose for the M/E crosswalk, which has helped me to have the crosswalk done in the blink of an eye, really appreciate the time you have spent to create this report and take me through all the steps.\n\n97#Dig out|Conor thanks for all your help with fixing the digital cert issues I had with ROS. We had an important compliance deadline to meet and you went out of your way to ensure the return was filed and my access issues were resolved. I really appreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to help me.\n\n98#Audit committee meeting a success!|Thank you for all the efforts over the last month(s) to get through all the work to gest us to the cusp of issuing our 2019 financial statements.  The audit committee was very pleased with the progress and results.  It has been a team effort to accomplish this and we will all need to celebrate (virtually for now) when the final audit sign off comes shortly!\n\n99#Customer insights|Thank you for joining SLT today Conor and sharing the analyst's view of the world. When I reached out, there was no hesitation, even though it would be 5pm on a Friday. The team found it very enlightening, and based on all the questions they asked, they were very engaged. It was helpful to go through the information hearing your point of view...what you look for, what are signals to call out, why you look at those. For many, it was new information, and it gave great insight into the health of our business.  When you popped on the screen in the suit and tie, it was the ice cream on top of the cake. Game, set and match! Thanks Conor!\n\n100#Monthly Reporting|Well done on another great monthly report Conor! I have to say, it's been wonderful to see these evolve over the years. It used to be a dump of data, but these days we are getting a little of the Conor personality between the numbers. It's getting more like a fireside chat with an analyst! I love it. Thank you!\n\n101#Board slide prep|Thank you for pulling together all the board slides in a timely manner with all the other priorities going on.  In the middle of the switch to the new revenue recogntion standard it is a challenge to report under both the old and new accounting policies while keeping the auditors happy (if that is even possible) and busy so we can get through the final stages of the audit.\n\n102#Strategic guidance at its best...|Team, on behalf of the Here to Help Team I wanted to thank you for your strategic partnership during the initial phases of scoping, outlining and ultimately standing up a pilot we now refer to as Operation Here to Help.  Each of you brought unique perspectives, questions, challenges and guidance to ensure we have a robust plan in place with qualitative metrics to measure success during this first phase and beyond.  We are excited to cautiously move forward knowing that we have a great Team supporting us throughout the journey.  Thank you so much for your time, attention and thoughts as we navigate through this \"gate\" and many more to come!\n\n103#Leading The Way...|A big thank you Conor for your strong leadership in the last few months, particularly given the turbulent times we are now working through. To begin you have allowed for the flexibility that myself and each team member need personally, and while doing so making sure we are all supported and connected in these times. You have led us through our busiest time of year, what with closing out both the year end audit, and (for my team) the 606 project. In particular for 606, you guided us as team through a 2 year long project that has now crossed the finish line. Your vast knowledge of the US GAAP process was a key contribution to making sure the model operated correctly, you constantly challenged us in terms of the whys and potential gaps, supported us with clear guidance, and kept us in check for timelines and milestones throughout. You allowed the space for us to step away from other areas, which was key to ensuring we had the capacity to make sure this was executed to plan. I for one look forward to when we can toast these achievements back in Dublin some day. Thanks again for all your support in these times.\n\n104#Closer together than ever before|This might sound crazy, but, somehow I feel that Although Covid-19 has put distance between us, we seem to be working closer together. We have had 3 meetings a week for 6 weeks now, where, there is no real agenda. Instead, we utilise this time to hear what is going on with each of our teams, HR and executive level. Every decision we make, we make it as a team, this means we are aligned quicker. Each task we complete, we share templates, have discussions, figure out how to put our best foot forward and seem to stay ahead of the game. I have benefited so much from our meetings and wanted t take the time to thank for all for the contributions.\n\n105#Finally across the finish line|Guys, I want to thank each one of you for your contributions in the recruitment process for the AR collector role we have had open since October. We have seen over 120 CV's had about 25 first-round interviews and maybe 5 or 6, 3-hour interview slots. We brought it down to 2 candidates both with strengths in different areas and finally, we have selected a candidate that we believe will be not only a culture fit but also really enhance our stakeholder relationships along with everything else. Your continuous feedback helped us to get across the line. I appreciate the time that you all put into this as I know it can impact your daily tasks. Thanks all!\n\n106#Audit Over|A huge thank you to everyone involved in the 2019 Dublin audit. This is a key annual deliverable of the finance team, a 5 week process that is one of the busiest and most demanding times of year for us all. Each one of your has contributed to this, in collating schedules, reconcilations, support documentation, analysis, detailed explanations, walkthroughs, memos, attending meetings and calls, answering queries and much more. Whatever EY asked, Finance answered. In particular this year, we had the added challenge of corona virus disruption, and performing a number of these weeks remotely. The face to face in the office with EY was removed and replaced with emails, skype calls and catch ups. As a team, each of you rose to the challenge showing perseverance and determination, providing all necessary requests, as per original timelines, with no delays. This is quiet an achievement as is a balancing act in itself to manage this, all the while keeping day to day activities running smoothly. And doing so in these challenging times, shows that as a team, when we all work together, we achieve success. Well done to you all. May we celebrate in person some time together in the future!\n\n107#thank you|Conor, thank you so much for your time earlier in setting up the keycode on my phone.\n\n108#Chief negotiator|Conor, well done on negotiating improved licence pricing for our new financial reporting tool. It was an education to be on the call and see how you worked with the vendor to secure a very good deal. You approached the vendor with a clear strategy and positioned it as a win win for both sides. The overall outcome is a cost saving to the business and we now also have the licences in place to support scale in the Finance Team.\n\n109#Guidance on Financial priorities|Steve and Conor, thank you for all your help framing the company's financial priorities and how to present them at the Fin Dev roadmap review with the Product Steering Committee. Your advice was invaluable in keeping the discussion \"out of the weeds\" and hence up at the appropriate level. Louise, thank you for providing so many supporting statistics to help make the case for change.\n\n110#PCI Compliant|Keeping the organisation certified as PCI compliant involves a lot of moving parts ... from meeting with auditors, to providing evidence to auditors, to signing attestations and registering those attestations with our provider. All done now for another year and I thank you all for your input which you each provided in a true spirit of collaboration!\n\n111#Keepin' it Legal during the dine around|Thanks to all of you for being great company at Legal Seafood's!  I really enjoyed getting to know each of you a bit better, as well as hearing some great stories about your unique lives and Workhuman's past.  From stories about marathons in far-off lands, adventures in New York city, the sights and sounds of India, the wild hills of Pennsylvania, safaris in South Africa - this is a well-traveled bunch!  You are all amazing humans - thank you!\n\n112#Thank you for all your support in 2019!|Frank & Conor, I believe this award is well overdue! I want to thank you both for all your support and taking the time to attend the many float meetings and continuously giving me constructive feedback to help me grow in my role. It’s been an exciting year and a massive learning curve for me and I definitely wouldn’t be where I am now if it wasn’t for all your support over the past year. So thank you again, it’s a great honour working with you and learning from you! Happy new year!\n\n113#28 this quarter!|28 humans. That's how many people assisted in one way or another with the Q4 year-end, last meeting of the decade and for each and every one of you, I am grateful! It's pretty incredible to think about the village that comes together to make this meeting happen. From confirming our speakers, creating slides, providing content, answering my many questions, testing and testing and testing (yes, 3x) the technology to provide a great experience for all, to ringing the gong - each of you receiving this award was integral to the overall success of the meeting.\n\n114#Raffle MC Extraordinaire|Conor, thanks so much for taking on the task of MC'ing the Christmas Raffle this week. You made it a fun experience for everyone and the feedback has been fantastic (next year I promise to take you through the prizes with more than 5 seconds to go!).\n\n115#Interim Audit Success|A well deserved shout out to all the Finance Team who got involved in this year’s interim audit. Overall we have received very positive feedback from EY Dublin, with no issues or concerns identified. The dedication and workload management demonstrated by all of you has been outstanding, along with a meticulous attention to detail in the quality of data provided. We are now positioned to hit the ground running for year end, a massive well done to you all!\n\n116#Perseverance|Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did....  I think this applies very strongly to the world of ASC606. A big thank you for your hard work and dedication on this project to date, which has been immense. In the last few weeks we have made significant progress in terms of controls, automating reports, system walkthroughs, validating figures, and the end result, quantifying restates.

We can certainly now see the light at the end of the tunnel, well done team!\n\n117#New hire breakfast!|Guys, I just wanted to take the time to express my gratitude to you all for consistently going out of your way to attend the new hire breakfast which we have introduced recently.

It also means I am moving further away from my manual spreadsheets, which can only be described as a welcome relief to my eyesight! For that, a sincere thank you!\n\n119#Recruitment Support|Hi Conor Thank you for all your help and support with the recruitment process for the recent finance hire.

Thanks to this phenomenal cross-functional team for all of the time, thoughtfulness, and dedication put into the evaluation of supplier integration partners and for the hard work to get us to this point.

In this time, each one of you has contributed in providing reports and reconciliations (& answering questions), invoice testing (& answering questions), variance analysis (& answering questions), process documentation (& answering questions), preparation of memos (& answering questions) and much, much more. In all, there has been a hell of a lot of questions, to which we can now safely say, all have a valid answer! This has all been done with a view to giving the external auditors comfort over our 2018 Financials. Massive congratulations and thank you all for your hard work and dedication in both getting us to this position, and ensuring the audit has run on time, successfully and without much disruption to day to day activities.

It really isn’t nice getting bad news when you are away but you were all there giving support!\n\n127#Customer Entertainment|It is such a sincere pleasure to work with such great colleagues.  Each of you was instrumental in helping us care for the approximately 500 cowbell-ringing customers who attended WH19.  From hosting tables and driving conversations on the first night at the Crazy Horse to executive dinners at Husk and hosting tables again at Innovations and Libations.  And it wasn't just sitting at those tables.  Each of you engaged in many, many discussions with a passion and energy befitting the Workhuman movement.  Many customers remarked to me how cared for they felt and how much they enjoy engaging with our exec team.  I'm grateful to be part of your team.  Thank you!\n\n128#Taking the time|Hi Conor,\n\nThank you taking the time to meet with me today to talk to me about what your team do and also explaining more about how the company operates from a financial perspective. I found it really useful and you explained everything in a really easy to understand way that was really interesting.

The hard work and collaboration was exceptional and the many hours spent working through our busiest time of the year supporting our growth whilst also preparing for year end was evident for all to see.  On top of our end of year busy period you hit the ground running in January by rolling forward schedules, revising estimates, running through reconciliations, pulling data from other sources, running reports, checking and reviewing and rechecking culminating in our best quarter end review.  This allowed us to review the fruits of our labor in a concise and informative 60 slide pack!  As we continue to grow it is comforting to see the various improvements that we have made over the past 12 months and I look forward to seeing us successfully execute in 2019 ..... well done!\n\n130#New Rent Accounting|Hi Guys, I would like to thank you for your help in being able to close out the details on our new expanded space in Dublin before we closed out our Yr End accounts. Without your help (and attention to detail) we would have had either none or incorrect figures booked. Thanks and enjoy, Graham\n\n131#Thank you|Hey Guys this is an overdue award, I just wanted to thank you for all the support and guidance in our weekly float reviews throughout 2018. I really appreciate you all taking the time out each week to meet with myself and review how floats are.  It's great to have this support as a group and individually to be able to meet and review all of the accounts each week, these weekly reviews have brought a great deal of support when planning and getting payments out the door. Float accounts are such a key part in AP & we have a lot of volume going through some of these accounts but with your continuous support , suggestions and planning allows us to get through the busy periods more efficiently . We ended this year in a very good position on all float accounts breaking all records when it comes to payments. We got through year end with all Float accounts reconciled. It's been the busiest year yet for floats , with continuous growth we added 5 new float accounts and together we successfully got them all set up and running smoothly. We seen Merchandise grow and double in volume, we had new clients added to debit cards and with all this going on we still met every week to review and catch up. I really appreciate the time you all took to give your support on floats. It's amazing to see how much it has grown in 2018, I'm excited to see how well everything goes in 2019. Thanks again everyone\n\n132#How do you do it?|Conor, I want to thank you for the support you gave me over 2018. Tbh I’m not sure how you do it... How can you make time for all the finance projects that we had in 2018? You were sure to make the time for each project in the finance team as they were all important. You gave guidance on all areas and if anything was forgotten you were sure to pick up on it! Over Christmas be sure to sit back and relax as I’m sure if will be good to switch off for a few days and not think about AR or AP! I also want to thank you for taking the time to coach me in areas I had to develop.. Here’s to the transition of good to great for 2019! Thank you and enjoy!\n\n133#Bank facility|Conor thanks for all your help getting the increased facility in place with BOI. This takes away a real stress point in the monthly payroll process. I really appreciate you working closely with legal and our account manager to get this over the line. It is great to see continued improvements in efficiencies in the Finance team.\n\n134#Phone-nomenal respect!|Thanks you for the lightning fast turnaround on our phone request - Our critical oncall phone has taken a battering over the years and was on its last legs - I reached out for an upgrade and you had one on my desk in a number of days - much appreciated Conor.\n\n135#Truly a great partner for CS|Conor, thank you once again for your great partnership.  We have been tackling a number of projects this year which has meant rapid turnarounds required on numerous requests.  You never fail to respond when we need your help,  you ask the right questions which help focus our \"ask\" and you always weigh in with consideration and the best interests of both the business and our customers combined. Thank you for your collaboration not just today, but throughout this whole year to date.\n\n136#Revenue recognition to the max|I thought a great job done by this entire team focused on the new revenue recognition standard meetings held this week.  There was fantastic discussion and working together to determine the best theoretical approach while understanding that we need to operationalize an approach that will work on a monthly basis.  The prep work done by the team showed through in the meeting with RSM.  I look forward to working together to get to final answers with E&Y and then embarking on the implementation journey!\n\n137#August Company Meeting|Eric, Conor, Vineet, and Maggie - Thank you for sharing your updates at the August company meeting.

Your efforts and ingenuity to find a way to file today is greatly appreciated!\n\n141#Personal data for invoicing|Conor, I would like to recognise you for the hard work that you also put into PD for clients and of course the liquid files.

Thank you and enjoy!\n\n142#Another audit in the record books|Great team effort to get through the 2017 audited financials with E&Y.  Even with some last minute audit requests and changes the team rallied to finalize the financial statement issuance in order to comply with our bank covenants.  Now onto new revenue recognition standards - yeah!\n\n143#Amazing GDPR Team!|Thank you to each and every one of you for your work on this project!  In true Globoforce style, you rolled up your sleeves, kept us on task, made yourselves available in an extremely responsive way, asked questions and got us to today.  Happy GDPR Day!\n\n144#GDPR Cross Functional Puzzle Masters|Each one of you managed a significant piece of the GDPR puzzle to get your teams ready for May 25--no small feat. We are now ready to forget people upon request, properly secure and encrypt personal data wherever it appears, and be fully transparent with our users about how, when and why we make use of their data. Along the way, we’ve developed new approaches to generating invoices, incorporated new technology to keep our data secure, cleaned up old processes we’ve been meaning to tackle for years, and better defined the rules of the road for going forward. It’s through your extraordinary efforts that we are able to say with confidence that we are prepared for GDPR. Thank you for your ongoing participation in our weekly check-ins and side meetings, your proactive look at how we can best address the requirements, and the active follow up throughout these past several months. Kudos to all of you for ensuring Globoforce reached this milestone!!\n\n145#WorkHuman Wednesday hosts!|Thank you all for recently hosting one of our WorkHuman Wednesday sessions. It's helpful to start the session out with a bit of an introduction before we press the play button, and to  have our leaders at these viewings to encourage others to attend and hear the important messages that were shared at WorkHuman. Thank you for stepping up and volunteering to host!\n\n146#Short cuts in Explorer|Hi Conor - I would like to thank you for showing me how to set up the quick links in explorer for accessing files from sharepoint. By having this it will save me time in how I am able to save and attach non MS documents ie PO's. Thanks for your help and enjoy, Graham\n\n147#Support any time any place!|Well Conor, it has been an interesting Q1 and one I’m sure neither of us will forget! It started of with year end, then straight into integration of the MD app (billing tool) and straight into the wonderful preparation changes that was released in March for GDPR prep! On top of all this it was the normal day to day for AR. And I know you are not just over seeing AR and you have other tasks to oversee and complete, but somehow you managed to give as much time to support me as needed! Q1 was a challenging quarter for me with being down staff, weather warnings etc and sometimes, I let it get to me but regardless you were there to show me there was light at the end of the tunnel! Conor, without you supporting me I’m not sure if I would have succeeded or if I would have been found rocking in a corner somewhere! Thank you for all you do!\n\n148#End Of Quarter Daily's!|Thank you all for your valued input during the daily end of quarter meetings. The meeting is a key part of managing expectations across the various functions in the Finance and Operations Departments, ensuring that both departments are aligned and continue to deliver successful end of quarter close out. Enjoy!\n\n149#Orientation Pro's!|Hi All, I just want to recognise the on-going support you have all shown for ensuring our new hires have the best first day experience here at Globoforce! We are over 6 months in and feedback has been fantastic to date and that's down to the sessions that each of you deliver. A lot goes in to to ensure we are delivering that wow first day and I appreciate your input at every session! Keep up the great work!!\n\n150#Allied Irish Bank Goes LIVE...& We Appreciate YOU!|Allied Irish Bank (AIB) is second largest bank in Ireland and they launched their global program to 10,000 employees (9,500 in Ireland alone!!) today - Monday 26 March.  This has been an amazing achievement not just for Globoforce but for AIB as well. The amount of bureaucracy that AIB had to go through to get approval was not an easy one. First, Globoforce had to build a site for them to use as a pilot and test it and get approval from the Irish Government, then there were the technical challenges of working with the banks many security restrictions but we as true partners we got through it and only after all this was achieved were they able to launch their program to all their employees. Last week at a VIP gala dinner at their headquarters this story was echoed to their guests from both their CEO, Bernard Byrne and CHRO, Triona Ferriter when they officially revealed that Appreciate! will be launching officially and that they are all very excited to start this amazing journey with Globoforce. This amazing journey could not have been done without the unique team spirit that comes with all of you working together to bring us to today! Everyone that I have interacted with at AIB have been so impressed at how efficient and how Globoforce is always over delivering in all areas, be it from a communication, technical or product point of view!  Thats some praise!!! Well done for helping us create a bigger footprint into Ireland!!!\n\n151#Tax configuration Workshop|Hello All,  I really want to thank you for your active participation during our workshop on Tax configuration. Everyone came with great ideas and it was very interesting to witness the impact of the configuration from one invoice to the reporting, and hence up to the tax declaration forms. As the workshop progressed we could see how everyone's work was interconnected, and that there were many aspects to take into consideration.  This workshop also generated more awareness in the team on how crucial it is to define precisely our requirements, taking into account that one person's change requirements, could affect another person's work. So it was very important to bring the light on the need to have a holistic approach to the project.  The positive energy and the engagement of everyone in this project is really great, and motivating! I also received great feedback and look forward to working with you on planning and implementation :)  So thank you all for your participation! Best regards, Nathalie\n\n152#BOI Pass|Conor, just want to say thanks for resetting my BOI password last week. I know the reset was a bit of an arduous task as the bank is in the process of rolling out keycode as a security measure. I know you had to make many calls in order to get me back up and running. Thanks to your prompt assistance and persistence, I had no downtime. Thanks for all your help, much appreciated. Enjoy!!\n\n153#TAG & Keycode|Conor, thanks for all your help with TAG and BOI Keycode setup and rollout. TAG in particular will greatly help streamline processes and improve efficiencies for the AP and FA team.  More time for value added tasks is the net result. Despite your busy schedule you took time to prioritise this work. Your support is really appreciated.\n\n154#New Update format|Conor, well done on they new format for weekly finance updates. Sometimes some small improvements create new clarity that brings everything into focus. The new Finance update was one of those - clear and self explanatory - and it will build throughout the year. Great work, thanks for investing the time and skill! Well done.\n\n155#On the ball|Antoinette and Conor, Just to say thanks to you both about my payroll query. It's great to know that things like this don;t go unnoticed well spotted Antoinette! This saves me time and money in the long run. Conor appreciate the reassurance and approachability you provided regarding the same matter. Thanks guys\n\n156#ASC606 Kickoff|Great job prepping for the meeting with RSM even with everything else going on.  This was a very efficient meeting.\n\n157#Quick turnaround|Despite being away and in a different timezone you acted immediately when I reached out to you regarding an issue with our On Call phone. Thanks again for sorting this so promptly!\n\n158#Great teamwork!|Hi All,  just wanted to say thank you for your help with the GE invoicing issues for January. Establishing the various changes and timings of changes and then where the changes needed to be made, and finally getting the invoices in to a position to be posted to the customers satisfaction.  Your assistance was much appreciated on this complex, especially knowing how \"picky\" this client can be.  Thanks  Gav\n\n159#Amazing support|Guys, I want to thank both of you for stepping in and closing the period with me being unexpectedly out of office. It’s not an easy task and especially not easy when you have had little training with the process but you both stepped up and completed the work. Thanks for the support and I’ll see you on my return!\n\n160#Thank you for taking the time|Thank you for carving time out of your busy schedules to meet with us last week. You shared info about your teams, your priorities and how we could partner together. It is so helpful to learn about what you and your teams since we don't get an opportunity to interact on a regular basis. Hopefully, these learnings will open up the doors for collaboration on many projects.\n\n161#RFP = Ridiculously Fabulous Performance!|Team what a fabulous way to close out January! Thanks to each and everyone of you for the unwavering partnership, steadfast support and the pure grit provided during this critical time. Just in time to close out the month, we finally got Biogen to sign a 3 year contract instead of going to RFP! This journey is challenging enough when it follows the normal process streams. Throw in trying to change someone’s mind and you’re going to need an army of the best minds in the business behind you. That’s what I had and I am incredibly grateful and proud to have your talent and expertise every step of the way. On the human side, many thanks for not giving up on me and for dealing with my incessant questions, curveballs, calls, texts, voicemails, Skype messages and the relentless scouts sent to your offices hah! It’s a game changer to know that no matter how many times I heard “no” or “we can’t”, this team will band together and leave no stone unturned to find the reasons why we CAN and WILL. Congratulations everyone and let’s keep bringing them back right here where they belong!!\n\n162#Board slide prep|Thank you for all the hard work and long hours to turnaround the board slides in record time after the year end close.  Your attention to details and variance explanations are very helpful in prepping for the board meeting next week.\n\n163#Integrated Invoicing is live!|Thanks to vision, ambition and guidance across many releases by Arann, Greg, Louise and Martin McG, supported by the FIN and OPSDEV teams, we now have an integrated solution for invoicing. When the MD App summarizes a required invoice, all the total values are sent to Epicor which returns the allocated Invoice number and any VAT due, so that the MD App invoicing solution can generate a final invoice needing no manual edits. Gone are the days of data entry on Epicor of total values for HUNDREDS of invoices twice a month. In the last days, we even eliminated the manual edits to add VAT.  Merck took the honours on Mon 22nd as the first integrated invoice generated.  Thank you to the visionaries, architects and implementers of this giant leap forward for our AR team.\n\n164#Available all the time|Conor, I just want to thank you for your support today at a drop of a hat. I am going through development changes and really wanted to ensure that I had understood the right way to complete a task. You kindly jumped on the phone and walked through it with me. Thank you for your support it’s greatly appreciated.\n\n165#Financials, margin and more!|Thanks, Conor for your time in two sessions to review the business, financials, and the data model behind our revenue and margin profile.  Given our complex and nuanced business, this was extremely helpful to get additional insight into what other drivers can impact margin in a significant way.  I look forward to working with you!  Thanks again!\n\n166#Christmas Calls|Hi Gents , apologies for the delay but I wanted to thank you for the support given to AP over the Christmas holidays. I know you both had some time off but I still had to reach out and make contact via text or calls to get some advice and approvals for ensuring our payments kept flowing to allow a smooth year end process for returning to work on the 02nd. Thank you for this support with AP and also the float area. Your continued support within the team is much appreciated. Enjoy\n\n167#2017 another vintage year|Conor, thanks for all your support and guidance in 2017. You have spearheaded the Finance team through multiple challenges and ensured that once again the team delivered on all fronts. Your knowledge and expertise are invaluable in leading the team and supporting the wider business as the company continues on its strong growth path. Its onwards and upwards as we look forward to another busy and successful year in 2018.\n\n168#Priorities!|Conor, I would like to thank you for taking the time to create the priority listing with me. I find that this is a really great tool for me as I am juggling requests and meetings quiet a lot at the minute, which sometimes can lead to forgetfulness (even with the notebook with scribbles all over it). For me this listing keeps me on track and really helps me focus on the 'What is really important' element and not just who's shouting the loudest. Thank you :-)\n\n169#Payroll change communication|Thank you for your help making sure the messaging was clear regarding the Dublin monthly payroll change for 2018. I appreciate your partnership in getting the message right and out on time!\n\n170#Employee Induction|Conor Really appreciate you stepping in a short notice to support my slot yesterday, feedback was very positive. Thanks\n\n171#New Orientation Day!|Hi All - we kicked off our first new orientation day yesterday and wow, what an amazing experience all our new people had!

Here's to many more great orientation days ahead!\n\n172#A team|Guys what a panel...do I need to say anymore! The survey results have come back and everyone thought the format was great and loved the insight into the company vision, competitors, strategy and overall progress update against this years business plan. I know it does not just happen!! so on behalf of the 200 Humans that were in attendance - thank you for making it a great day.\n\n173#Guidance when needed!|Conor, thank you so much for responding to Syngenta's requests on invoicing, VAT and sales tax. The team was really appreciative of your quick response and offering to join a call if required to share the information needed.  You addressed all their queries and gave them the level of comfort needed to proceed, thank you!\n\n174#2016 Audited Financials|Great job in completing the 2016 audited financials with E&Y.  It took everyone working together to bring this to finalization.  I appreciate the team going the extra mile, working with E&Y counterparts in both Dublin and Boston to get through all the detail testing and multiple open item lists.  Everyone rallying to get through open items to have a successful audit committee meeting was crucial.  Now on to statutory accounts, revenue recognition new standard and 2017 planning!\n\n175#Always focused|Conor, I would like to take time to thank you for your support with the project we have on going for a collections system. You joined us for a 3 day workshop and always gave valuable advice and feedback where needed! Regardless of the request you will always help out your team!

Bernadette.\n\n177#\"How do you like your burger?\"|Thanks for your enthusiastic participation in reviewing how we can configure invoices for clients. We got a great team dynamic going where we weighed up the inherent complexities, the attempted simplifications, the desirable constraints versus the pragmatism of dealing with clients who don't fit within norms. Together we arrived at a UX that should be easy to use (given the complexity!), and a data model and approach to make it happen. It's like we started with a menu of burger and/or chips, and ended up being able to cope with \"double cheese and no pickle on mine\". Great co-operation and probing all the weak points in the successive proposals.  Thank you!\n\n178#W-8BEN-E|Conor, I wanted to thank you for getting the new version of the W8 completed. It took numerous emails and chasing to get the new GIIN number but you persevered and we were finally able to get it sent out to the customers who had been hounding us for it. Thanks again!\n\n179#Recruitment|I would like to thank you both for your time and also your guidance while we were recruiting for our 2 open roles on my team. I know I'm not easy to please and it can take time to find the right candidates but it's always worthwhile. I'm glad that you's are always their for the feedback when I'm indecisive! Thank you and enjoy.\n\n180#Revenue Accountant|Conor, thanks for your valuable input to the recruitment process for the Senior Revenue Accountant.

Thanks to your value added contribution we now have a very strong recruit who will help drive Revenue Accounting forward.\n\n181#GloboInnovation help|Thank you very much for taking the time to answer all the questions I had when preparing for my GloboInnovation presentation. Your detailed explanation regarding breakage was extremely helpful. Great Teamwork !\n\n182#Where's the tool box??|Conor, you really went above and beyond your job role this weekend when sorting out the shelves in the storage room! It was a tough job (that involved a screwdriver and a bit of weight lifting) but you kept at it! Gave me a laugh on Monday morning anyways :-) at least we know that you can be the handy man for finance :-p enjoy!\n\n183#Great teamwork enables invoicing selected batches|Thanks to Conor and Martin for outlining the requirements, and to Louise and Gavin for demonstrating the EI Tool precedent used for Intuit, and to Julie for mocking up a better UI for the MD App, and to Greg for design advice, and to the Abacus team for implementation: The MD App can now invoice for selected batches on demand. This is another important step in phasing out the EI Tool, which wasn't able to properly invoice batches that span invoicing entities. Thanks also to the team for tackling the issues that will continue to arise until the EI Tool is finally decommissioned.\n\n184#The gift of knowledge|Conor, I appreciated you taking the time to explain all the areas that could be impact on the introduction of new clients. You went in to a lot of detail which allowed me to relate this back to my own area. This in turn will empower me to make important decisions to prevent any relevant areas with AP from falling down. Thanks' for sharing.\n\n185#Ulster Bank to NULster Bank|Hi Conor, i would like to thank you for helping get our Ulster Bank finally closed. You were the only person they would speak to and it took many calls and many people being transferred to but we got there in the end thanks to you. So enjoy, Graham\n\n186#XL Connect|Conor, thanks for getting a consultant in to walk us through XL connect. This has been on our radar for quite a while and it was great to finally have an expert on site. It was a very informative session and gave us a good overview of best practice in designing reports. The knowledge gained will be very useful in determining if XL connect is to be our reporting tool of choice.\n\n187#Following Through..|Conor: Thank you very much for all of your help in facilitating completion on the final stages of the Irish lease process. You were extremely helpful  in ensuring that the requisite stamp duty was wired in a timely manner and even more so, when we ran into issues with our stamp duty certificate and the landlord's solicitors, you took the matter into your own hands and had the issue corrected seamlessly. Your responsiveness and respect for teamwork are very much appreciated.\n\n188#Great progress on invoicing in R2017.1|Well done to the Abacus team for another significant step forward in automating invoicing. We released the technology to customize MIS Report columns via client meta data. More than that, we migrated every possible client off EI Tool and they'll start on automatic invoices from March. Special thanks to Jennie for cleansing data, and to James for the very thorough testing of hundreds of permutations. And all this achieved while fielding all end-of-year financial questions. Thank you all!\n\n189#Working the audit!|Hi  I just wanted to say a big thanks for stepping up and meeting the PCI Auditor on Wednesday at such short notice.

There certainly was many starts and stops with the audit team on both sides of the Atlantic over the months since the audit began but together you were able to answer all the open items and finalize the financial statements for some critical customer deliverables.  Now on to the statutory accounts in FRS102 and 2016 audit planning!.\n\n202#Automated invoicing spreads and gets more robust|Well done Abacus team on making invoicing more robust and complete in R2016.4. The growing number of clients with YOS Packs can now have their invoicing automated. We also fixed many weaknesses and eliminated a significant concern of the AR team: that we might bill an award twice if a client's Invoice IDs became out of sync. Through your attention to detail, we have made more progress on the roll-out of robust, automated invoicing to our client base. Thank you!\n\n203#Abacus team|Thanks all for being such great team mates on the Abacus scrum team. Over the years we have had many lively discussions on whether a button should be blue, or have rounded corners or should be a link; on the life-cycle of a GCN or ZVA; and also some very important discussions about what IT solutions we need to develop for the Finance department to help ensure it fulfills its strategic needs. Together we built the US-GAAP Revenue Recognition model and reports, which now provides mission-critical reports to the Exec team on a weekly basis.  We created the Finance Master Data application, developing it in a very user-centric approach, and putting in place an application that will support the finance team’s needs to configure key customer data for fees and invoicing, and for the running of revenue reports. And the new automated Biller we developed is now churning out invoices in seconds!  I now hand the scrum master duties into the very capable hands of Nadine.  Keep up the great work!\n\n204#Thanks|Thanks for getting my Revenue access set up.\n\n205#Another great working session|I wanted to thank you for dedicating half of your day in order to have an open conversation around opportunities and areas for improvement between Customer Success and Accounts.

Thank you!\n\n208#R2016.2 brings automatic invoicing to more clients|Congratulations, AR and Abacus team on another multiple birth! In March we automated invoicing for UHG.

I am learning all the time from all our little conversations (again especially with the GE YOS account) and having all this 'knowledge' has made it easier for me to clearly answer their problems without causing confusion at both ends! Thanks again for supporting Client Services and making the job that little bit easier!! Enjoy!\n\n282#|Great job on the new monthly sales report.  The rollup of sales data into useful summary  information will be extremely helpful in forecasting the business as we continue to grow!\n\n283#|Hi Team    Thank yo uall for your excellent efforts regarding the billing & recionciliation project.  GE were delighted with the results and Mike Correia at GE had these kind words to say:      \"The GF team has hit all 3 of their milestone/deliverables right on target ... an outstanding job. Aside from any items that arise during testing, this ends GF's part of the project.  Please accept our sincere thanks for your outstanding efforts.\"    Well done team - a great job by all!  Keep up the excellent work!    Alice :-)\n\n284#|Great job reducing days sales outstanding to under 60 days and collecting some old receivables.
