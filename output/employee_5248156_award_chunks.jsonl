"0#Forum got it's Paris look!|A unique space provided a unique opportunity to showcase the Workhuman brand not only in digital and print, but in light and video effects.  Thank you for all you did to help bring our look and feel to life at our first Forum in Paris!  From the entrance to the convention center to the opening moment to the exclusive feel of the content delivery, you hit all the marks! It was so great to see your talents on display!\n\n1#It's in the details|After hearing a lot of real-time reactions and feedback at Unleash I wanted to give this team a shout out for the thoughtfulness that went into the conceptual ideation behind the booth theme and the ties made to Forum. Every detail was intentional, and I heard from multiple attendees that they really resonated with our Elevate theme and messaging, loved the booth's connection to France, and wanted to learn more about Workhuman. I know there was a lot of research, brainstorming, and coordination that went into bringing the theme to life, it was noticed by many and so appreciated!\n\n2#Soaring high in Paris!|I'm getting a bit tired of congratulating you all for (yet again) setting a new bar, but when you all helped pull off what was our largest and most impactful 3rd party event activation EVER, it has to be done!  This team absolutely crushed it last week, delivering two amazing back-to-back events with our first ever Workhuman Forum in Paris and then straight into UnleashWorld, where we dominated attendee mindshare. From the months of planning and design, to pre-event registration drives, meeting scheduling, and hospitality planning, to the flawless on-the-ground execution, it was an extraordinary end result.  The quality of engagement you all drove across an action-packed 3 days and nights doesn't just happen by chance. Every detail was sweated over. Every activity was well prepped and rehearsed. And the plan was orchestrated and delivered to perfection.  I couldn't be more proud of the effort put forth by you all and seeing the results of that effort take form. A sincere THANKS to all who contributed, with special thanks to our extraordinary Events team, who just set that new bar in how to show up big and deliver an extraordinary experience.\n\n3#Into the Prosaria-Verse|The Prosaria-Verse. A digital culture frontier. A demo experience where prospects envision themselves and their teams as the heroes of a story of recognition through the career journeys of Priya Gupta and the people of Prosaria. Leveraging learnings from the most effective custom demos, we set out to create a Sales Demo experience where memorable and authentic storytelling ties directly to Workhuman value and competitive differentiation.  Darcy, your world-building talent would put even the mighty Matt Mercer to shame. This visionary framework laid the groundwork, shaping Prosaria’s unique history and personas and leaving us all spellbound when we first laid eyes on what you had accomplished. It was the perfect inspiration and launching point for Matt and Kevin to craft the first set of recognition, award stories, and a reimagined YOS with a perfect blend of humor and human connection.  Nuvs, you set the stage by giving the team an actual demo, then advised the team on how a presentation works and where we should focus our effort to be as efficient as possible. Jen and Maureen, you both bring so much brand storytelling expertise to the table, as well as an eye towards extracting as much value from this new Prosaria-Verse as possible in future event experiences and marketing materials.   Barin, Erin, and Maggie, you keep us all on target with an eye towards Workhuman’s core messaging themes, future enablement, and of course the urgency to get this in the hands of our Sales Team ASAP!   And finally, Brian Kennedy, who as we speak, is the wizard behind the curtain implementing the MVP batch of stories into the demo.   This MVP release is just a taste of what’s to come. We’ve only dipped our toes into the vast potential of the Prosaria-verse, but it’s a journey I’m beyond excited to take with you all.\n\n4#Our ideas go big (41x17 ft)|The Davos billboard creative is solidified, and now in the hands of fate. This collective of bright brand minds was instrumental in helping mold the message we’re putting in front of thousands at the World Economic Forum. In order to arrive on like 15 words, we had to consider all the words (gasp), and I’m grateful Jill assembled this A-list crew to help get us there. Getting exposure to your unique POVs was hugely insightful for me, learnings I'll carry beyond this project.  Thanks again for the brain buffet.\n\n5#Power Partners|I can’t thank the three of you enough. Your insight, patience, and partnership through the Davos billboard process were everything a great teammate should be. From brainstorms to 11th-hour asks, you kept the shared goal front and center and didn’t miss a beat. The process wasn’t perfect, but your grace and collaboration meant a lot. Thank you for being such kind, thoughtful, and impactful partners.\n\n6#Feedback in a Flash|Thank you all for going outside the regular process this week to give quick, in the moment feedback and approvals for Unleash. We had an aggressive timeline to get things to print, and you all made the time to get us prompt and efficient feedback. Appreciate you!\n\n7#Kind Wisdom|Jen, thank you for being someone I can go to for perspective, insight and guidance. Your advice on how to frame a review session with senior leadership really set us on the right track and the result was a very fruitful meeting with the outcome that we were hoping for. Not to mention, I slacked you with my questions during a Summer Friday, and you took the time to respond then and there. I so appreciate you!\n\n8#Reel good work!|Eric's Speaker \"Sizzle Reel\" is finished, and it's chef's kiss!   James, Aidan, Jen, and Allie — thank you each of your parts in landing this project. This was a complicated, loooooooong, and high-stakes lift on a tight runway, and you all delivered.  Jen & Allie — you logged so much time watching and listening to talks/panels/interviews, and help craft clean narrative arc that actually says something. You pressure-tested the story, dug through the archives, and kept the narrative sharp.  James & Aidan — you are my heroes. This video is so effective at carrying the story, and end-to-end it's so polished and compelling. I know this source material was challenging to say the least and you both brought it home with class.    The result shows Eric at his best: credible, modern, high-energy, and unmistakably himself. It will be a centerpiece of his speaker portfolio and a go-to asset for pitches. I can't wait for the world to see it.  Thank you all for the hours of work. You made something we’re all proud to put out there.\n\n9#Valued Collaborator|Jen, I just wanted to say thanks for always having my back and being such a steady source of support for all things video. Your input on the recent project for Eric's video reel was spot-on and made a real difference. Beyond that, you’re just an inspiring person to be around: crafty, clever, chaotic (ha!) I'm grateful to work alongside you.\n\n10#road showS|Jen - this is to recognize all the time and effort you have put into multiple 'roadshows' lately. You are reaching out to stakeholders to share early messaging for WHL 2026, and the upcoming Forum/Unleash combo event. You present the work to different audiences to make sure everyone is informed, and present it in a way to matters most to each audience. Digestible, tailored content in a professional, polished presentation. Key to keeping the work moving on schedule. Way to go!\n\n11#Not to be deflated!|I'm impressed with how this team came together quickly to create a comprehensive brief for our vendor that enabled us all to reset and get back on track.  You recognized a disconnect and rolled up your sleeves to get the work done, so no time was wasted and we can continue to work to meet our deadlines.\n\n12#Buzzing With Ideas - thank you!|Jen, thank you for bringing us all together as we work to make WHL '26 the best ever. You moved quickly on orchestrating a thoughtful workshop that no doubt brought great ideas and revealed areas for opportunity in Orlando. Beyond that, the team was thrilled to be involved, and bring value to an area they might not always get to play. Thanks for your collaboration, and inclusion. Here's to more hive-mind moments as we march forward as a creative unit!\n\n13#the two most horrifying word for creatives...|\"Group brainstorm.\" Yet, for the WHL thematic brainstorm, you managed to create a space that was open and just the right amount of structured. Your experience in all things WHL is only eclipsed by your ability to articulate it. Thank you for a fun unconventional day and bringing your signature Jenergy. <-- You can keep that.\n\n14#Keynote Dream Team Back Again|Jen, Lisa, and Darcy - thank you for your dedication, attention to detail, creativity and agility that brought to life Eric's WHL Keynote. From the first sessions back in October to the final uploads to the stage, your commitment to quality was put on display for thousands of people from the HR industry to experience. I'm looking forward to partnering with you on the next one!\n\n15#What a show!|What a week and what an achievement! It was lovely to get some time in this over the last few days. I'm stoked to work with you moving forward, Jen!\n\n16#An Extraordinary WHL|What you pulled off at Workhuman Live was nothing short of extraordinary. Every single detail—from the technology that powered the experience, to the stunning creative that framed our brand and our executives—was executed with precision, care, and excellence.  You created an environment that didn’t just look exceptional, but felt like Workhuman. The logistics, the operations, the room blocks, the speaker briefings, the attendee journeys—you orchestrated every piece with a level of rigor and creativity that made the impossible look effortless.  From the first pre-promotion touchpoint to the moment attendees walked into the space, to the content creation, the live on-site execution, the speaker curation and delivery, to the last-minute signage changes and the seamless video production—you owned it all. And you did it while managing thousands of humans moving through a complex environment, aligning every detail to our theme, our purpose, and our mission.  You brought Eric’s keynote to life with vision and thoughtfulness. You made sure our content tracks were cohesive, our speakers prepared and impactful, and our message loud and clear across every stage, room, and moment.  This was more than a flawless event. This was a defining moment of brand leadership—something only Workhuman could do, because of you.  I’m phenomenally proud of this team. Let’s carry this momentum into Orlando 2026. I already can’t wait.  —Richardtemp\n\n17#Built with Heart, Powered by You|Before the lights go up, before we scan the first of the best conferance badges ever, before a single speaker takes the stage—there's something that absolutely must be said:  Thank you.  This team has already achieved something remarkable. The creativity, precision, late nights, and tireless problem-solving you've poured into this event are the foundation of its success—regardless of what happens once the doors open. You've turned strategy into schedules, ideas into experiences, and ambition into execution. WHL is the culmination of your brilliance and hard work.  This recognition isn’t for what might happen next. It’s for everything you've done to make this moment possible. Your work has already made us proud. And now, it’s time to bring it to life.  Let’s go make some magic—but know that the real magic? That already happened, behind the scenes, together.\n\n18#The Most PERFECT Conference Badge -- EVER|It's been 10 years in the making...we've laughed, we've cried, we've fought, I've pouted, but we've finally done it! The new badges for Workhuman Live 2025 are great. It is the perfect font, font size, boldness, background, color contrast for the first name and the company name. The badge colors and people icons add the right amount of attendee information to help us prioritize are interactions at the event. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our needs and to make it happen for this year's event. It will make a world of difference for us all at the event!\n\n19#From London to Paris|When it comes to a site visit with the events team there's two things I know for sure, it's going to be super busy + productive, but it's also going to be a lot of fun! At the beginning of the week, this group masterfully managed so many aspects of WHL Forum London, to immediately switch gears and start planning for Paris! It was so impactful to see the space and to hear the strategic ideas and questions that will no doubt make for another thoughtful and memorable event! Thank you for a great week and lots of laughs along the way!\n\n20#\"How can I help?\"|A shout out to this team who always happy to help. The days leading up to an event are always stressful, but each person here checked in to see what you could help with, whether it was helping move 70 pound crates, finding a pair of scissors, helping manage the 500 person queue, or even just keeping us hydrated. You all make sure no one is ever left behind. I appreciate you all!\n\n21#Live from Framingham...|(read with the voice of the SNL announcer): It's the Traci and Jen show! Supported by writer, Darcy Jacobsen, videographer & editor extraordinaire James Hamar, event promo and support from Lauren O'Donnell, graphics by Lisa Doughty, and technical support from Nicole Sargent! And starring...  ⭐Traci & Jen⭐ Traci, months ago you had an idea to build on something you had done once before, an orientation Workhuman Live, but you had previously done this in person for attendees. Smartly you thought what if we did a webinar before the event do drum up excitement & registration? Jen, you enthusiastically said \"heck yes!\" and joined Traci to bring your creative insights into why Workhuman Live is an event like no other. It's fun and a bit nerve wracking to shake things up and try something new. In this case it was recording a \"live\" webinar in the Framingham studio, in person instead of on zoom and there were so many supporting cast and crew members who brought their expertise to help.   The result? A 20-minute overview of what customers can expect at Live in Denver and why they should come. 100% of post-webinar survey responders said they found the session valuable, with one commenting \"Wish this had been around the year that I went to Workhuman Live for the first time!\" We've learned a lot of lessons to bring to the next studio recording. Thank you all for bringing your creativity to this project!\n\n22#Interview Dream Team!!!!!!!!!!!!!|HUGE shoutout to this crew for being a rockstar interview panel.  Juggling the logistics of three onsite interviews in a short amount of time is no easy task (not to mention room switches and multiple interviews in the same day).  I can't express how much I appreciate you all taking the time to not only interview, but provide such quality feedback (which was so incredibly impactful in making a hiring decision!!!!!).  Thank you all for being such great hiring partners!\n\n23#Assets for Mercer Research - Thank you!|Thank you both for helping me pull together high-quality assets to send to the Mercer team on information density & impactful recognition. These will be so helpful to give the research team context to what differentiates \"Recognition Done Right\" and create a storyline that reinforces what makes recognition data the best resource for Skills and Talent Intelligence.\n\n24#Human Intelligence Core Collaborators|As we make the final approach to the Human Intelligence 2025 Release digital event, I want to send a massive THANK YOU to this core group of collaborators that I've had the pleasure of working closely with over the last 4 months.  It's fitting that the animation above says \"Good things come to those who don't wait,\" because when we were tasked with organizing this campaign and event back in late October, this group wasted little time in strategizing how to deliver Workhuman's most impactful innovation release against some serious time constraints.  The results speak for themselves. We've already reached over 8,000 registrations that include almost 100% customer coverage, and we can all agree that the messaging, copy, and creative that has been delivered through this project has been next-level.  Personally and professionally, I can't thank you all enough for this experience. I've learned so much from each of your different expertise and through how you each approach cross-functional collaboration on this scale. What I'm most impressed by is the consistent positive attitude and collaborative mindset. This was a big undertaking that required a lot of strategic and execution-focused work, but we were so productive because we kept the focus on progress.  Can't wait for the next one...lol\n\n25#No Slide Left Behind!|Thank you for your teamwork in creating a memorable and inspirational Activate Keynote. From the very first meeting to the final font check, you were strategic partners in helping bring my vision to the stage. I continue to be impressed by your attention to detail, creative content development, and respect for urgency, while also being patient and receptive to feedback along the way. You helped create an experience for the audience that balanced humor with high-level concepts, making it both educational and entertaining. I look forward to continuing our partnership to advance the narrative for the HI launch, Forum, WHL, and beyond. Thank you and Phew!\n\n26#Leaning into strategy!|Team — I truly appreciate the dedication, critical thinking, and collaboration that went into refining the Human Intelligence 2025 release story and overarching narrative arc this week. The willingness to come together, challenge ideas, and push for alignment is what will make this launch exceptional.  From the zoom-in and zoom-out introduction video, to Eric’s keynote, the 15–20+ vignettes, the product segments, the reward stories, and culminating in the Josh Bersin final interview, every piece of this story must connect seamlessly—and your commitment to that vision is clear. Aligning on a storyboard, ensuring we’re all moving in the same direction, and sharpening the narrative is absolutely critical to its success.  Thank you for being vulnerable, for leaning into strategy, and for putting aside personal preferences in service of a powerful, unified vision. This story is going to make an impact—not just for Workhuman, but for the entire HR industry. I can’t wait to see it come to life!\n\n27#Voice of Activate|making Laury the voice of Activate wouldn’t of been possible without all of you. From scripting to recording to Avatar design and animation everyone brought the energy to turn this around quickly and swiftly! Laury as digital host for the win!\n\n28#Now That's Leadership|Jen - One of the characteristics of this particular company value is \"rebounding from adversity and overcoming obstacles.\" During a challenging period, even during your brief time away, your leadership shone through because your team was able to keep things going. This would have been impossible if not for the example you set, and the team's desire to deliver on your vision. We're all glad you're back, and pleased you're here to see your team's goodness come to life.\n\n29#Roll The Video Tape!|James & Jen - Thank you for your partnership and collaboration on the videos for the HI 2025 Release event. We've got our work cut out for us, but thanks to your creativity, hustle, and experience, I know they'll be great.\n\n30#Supreme Collaboration for Accelerated GTM Planning|Just want to start this off by saying this is an incredible group of people. I have been constantly amazed and impressed throughout this past month+ by this group's ability to collaborate decisively to organize and take action on the Marketing plan for the Human Intelligence 2025 Release.  I've been so inspired by how you all quickly acted to present innovative plans for the Human Intelligence launch to only then act even quicker to move forward with execution. In the weeks leading up to the holidays, you all have worked together to brainstorm, workshop, and problem-solve, all while respecting the necessary work-life balance people need to enjoy the holidays for family and friends.  My experience working with you all this project thus far has me extremely excited about what we will accomplish in 2025. I really appreciate the way this group conducts itself and couldn't be more proud to be a part of it.\n\n31#My heart grew three sizes that day...|Yesterday, we held an informal WHL update meeting. When it ended, the team applauded. What an amazing show of support and camaraderie. Just like the grinch, my heart grew three sizes!    And now I applaud you. This event is successful because of this team's contributions, collaboration, passion, and leadership.\n\n32#hi Collaboration|Thank you all for a great, productive, and collaborative meeting. Don - great job facilitating, James & Jen - for always coming with your best ideas and being open to others, and Christina & Wendy for helping work out how this will all get done and when. I'm confident we are going to deliver an awesome production.\n\n33#Moving Fast and Breaking Norms|Team, over the past two weeks, you’ve truly embodied the spirit of “Move Fast and Break Things.” Your efforts in shaping innovative concepts for the 2025 Human Intelligence Release and the Brené Brown Roadshow are nothing short of extraordinary (in line with record approval timelines)  You’ve shattered conventional thinking, embraced greater risk with a bold vision and experimentation (untested) with new approaches — all while maintaining your deep understanding of digital and event execution. By leading with positivity and opportunity, you are not just breaking execution norms but rebuilding them in ways that inspire and ignite transformation and culture within the team.   You’re not just moving fast; you’re moving forward, and the ripple effect of your positivity and innovation is already evident in the direction we're moving and the \"insider speak\" about these projects.   Thank you for your courage, your passion, and your ability to take our ideas to new heights. Let’s keep the momentum going!\n\n34#Team WHL 🦃|Thankful to all of you for being collaborative partners, creative thinkers, and just generally fun humans to be around. The past few months of Workhuman Live prep have been some of the most challenging and most fun to work on yet - and I couldn’t ask for a better team to tackle it with. Grateful for all of you ❤️❤️\n\n35#Good friends and trusted advisors|I just wanted to thank you for all of the feedback you gave me this week for a speaking opportunity that I was nervous about. Your thoughts on the words as well as your support and encouragement really helped my confidence level. You are all so generous with your time to help me and one another - I'm just so grateful for you three.\n\n36#and the oscar goes to...|Jen - writing scripts for you is not for the faint of heart. your knowledge and articulation of workhuman live and its many intricacies is so thorough, i found myself starting at a blinking cursor, fighting symptoms of imposter syndrome, and finishing a full box of family-sized cheez-its (reduced fat!). when a draft was ready to review, you asked all the right questions and steered us to higher ground. and the performance. the performance. your first take would be many thespians' last - only bested by your disposition on set. that's a vulnerable spot, and you crushed. happy to be a part of it.\n\n37#Thank you, social media star|I wanted to share my utmost gratitude to you for helping me create social media videos for WHL. I can't wait to see the final results. Thank you for your continued support and collaboration.\n\n38#il faut un village|Merci to all of the many creatives involved in Unleash this year. From the many rounds of booth copy and design, to the smallest touches onsite, this experience was successful in part because of all of your contributions. Matt, you slayed the floral puns from day 1 and were in the trenches with us all the way through. Eva, you crushed the translation of the booth theme to the promotional assets. Owen, you were instrumental in ensuring consistency and helping infuse the new brand messaging. Darcy, your quiz continues to cultivate connections and inspire attendees. Alana, your booth design was stunning and thoughtfully executed, even with a variety of challenges thrown your way. Kevin, your work on the figma demos allowed attendees to experience the platform (and specifically iQ!) in a way that we haven't been able to do before, which hopefully will help us to bring in even more future customers. And Jen – your constant leadership throughout the process helped us get across the finish line, even with some pretty wild last minute hurdles. So thankful for this extended team of amazing creatives who make working on events like this so fun. You really ROSE to the occassion. (had to get one last floral pun in there.)\n\n39#Reimagining the art of the demo|I was utterly blown away at Unleash by the interactive, immersive demo experience you created, Jen! Your ability to reimagine status quo is truly epic. (Is it due, at least in part, to the meditating?!)   Thank you for taking creative liberties and showcasing a fresh approach to the demo using a more adult-learner-friendly style!! Fingers crossed that with enough evangelism (sign me up to help!), these screens will be everywhere by Denver!\n\n40#Flower Power|This team has it all. Integrity, passion, desire for the best outcomes and most of all kindness.  You all were more than willing to help and execute anything and everything that was needed.  Tradeshow days are long but you never wavered in your willingness to be there for your teammates from show start to show end.   Most of all-you are all a blast to work with and that makes it all easier!\n\n41#Unleash Booth Theater Crew|Thank you team for your on-site help with the unleash booth theater. We are so proud of the success of these sessions which wouldn’t have been possible without you!\n\n42#Giving flowers to my Parisian pals|I cannot thanks this group enough for everything this week! From travel buddies, to booth clean up, you all were by my side. You all are the definition of \"teamwork\"; whenever an issue arose or there was work to be done or even just a morale boost was needed, there was no hesitation before you stepped into help. THANK YOU!\n\n43#Q&A on the fly|Thanks to each of you for either getting me files I needed, questions answered, getting an idea situated, and or meeting last minute to keep a project going. Truly helps me stay in the zone on creative and also helps other projects move along w/o needing to juggle between them so the solutions are stronger.\n\n44#Taking the helm|Jennifer, thank you so very much for stepping up and taking the lead on several recent meetings.  With some PTO on my horizon, I knew it would be difficult to prepare or effectively lead discussions with sales and ce around goals.  You were more than willing to run with them, lead the discussions, prepare the materials, and ensure we had productive outcomes.  I then volunteered you to join this weeks learning lab and pitch Live to all the attending customers – which you once again graciously stepped up for.  I appreciate you partnership, collaboration, and teamwork to ensure the teams success.\n\n45#WHL Early Bird Goal - Achieved|It's the first milestone of many for Workhuman Live - and this team crushed it.  We reached 300 registrations for Workhuman Live 2025 before the official website is even launched!  This achievement puts us well on our way to our (very lofty) total registration goals for the year.  None of it could be accomplished without each and every person on this team.  Thanks to everyone for the dedication, collaboration and creativity.\n\n46#Super Jen|Jen, thank you for your leadership this past year. You've been an incredible advocate, sounding board, and true partner for all things events. I really appreciate how you listen to our challenges, help us find solutions, and always support our team—even when we have crazy ideas! Looking forward to all that we'll accomplish in the next year and beyond!\n\n47#Gratitude for the greatest colleagues|I realize this is a big group but in reflecting upon World Gratitude Day, I wanted to thank y’all for helping me feel like a true member of the team (multiple teams, really 😂) from many miles away. ❤️ Some of these moments have been recent and others a little further back, but I greatly value them and each of you! You make Workhuman a better place to work, and I feel fortunate to be a part of it. Cheers! 🎉\n\n48#Colorado Called - You answered!|Team - thanks to everyone for the work putting together the \"Colorado is Calling\" overview for the sales, customer and marketing teams.  It's hard to carve out time to work on a deck when you are actively working on all the elements for the event itself!  You all did a great job giving the teams information needed to get the buzz for the event going now.  Appreciate you!  Ryan - special thanks for being on hand to cover all our tech needs - it went off without a hitch.\n\n49#Early and detailed setup for success|Well done on a great first meeting with Sales and CS to share all the plans and progress for WHL Gaylord Rockies.

The value we've seen has been immediate, and it's a bonus that you're all such fun and nice people.\n\n51#Gartner Gratitude. Guaranteed.|Thank you to this team for working diligently to create a design and message for the Gartner booth that is just right for our EMEA audience.  You navigated around shifting messaging, coordinated around well-deserved vacations and found a way to fit a wealth of content into a limited space. And did it all on time!  The result is a bold design that will have us standing out on the trade show floor as #1!  You all ROSE to the occasion!\n\n52#Web Humans Working on Workhuman Live Web|To the WHL Web team, and those who've joined us on this quest for digital excellence , I greatly appreciate the time, brainpower, and opinions you brought to the inaugural week of webpage development. This is always a transformational time for our unit. And with the continuous innovations in processes and perspectives, comes the fear and excitement of the unknown. If this first week has shown me anything, it's the shared passion you bring to making Workhuman Live 2025 our best conference site yet. Let's do this!\n\n53#Drumroll for the Drum Awards|Thanks to this team for working diligently and at warp speed to complete the submission requirements for the Drum Awards.  Because of your efforts outlining all the Workhuman Live 2024 achievements we were able to submit for three categories for consideration.  Workhuman Live is an unparalleled event (in my humble opinion) and I'm confident that the Drum Awards will recognize the efforts of our entire team when the results are in.  Fingers crossed!\n\n54#That's a Wrap|The 2024 Spotlight Series just wrapped up! The 2nd and 3rd episodes were only a month apart! Thank you for your participation. The work started almost a year ago and each of you said 'Yes' to your role, whether it was work that spanned over the year, or involved being recorded for a segment. A lot of work goes into this event - planning, sourcing, promo, web, tech support, scripting, recordings, post-production. The list is long, and so is the list of humans who support this event. The team learned and pivoted over the year, modified the segments, adjusted the promo, never gave up on sourcing speakers, got creative with recording locations, and masterfully edited the episodes to include the best of the best content. Spotlight is the bass guitar of the Events portfolio - the important steady beat supporting our message and a platform to share it with the world. Cheers to all of you!\n\n55#All the small things|I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of you for what outstanding team members you all are. Your dedication to helping each other and collaborating with other teams and stakeholders ensures that every event we handle is a resounding success. Your commitment to excellence is evident in every detail of your work and to all of our attendees no matter what event you are working on. Your teamwork and unwavering support for one another set a high standard and make our collective achievements possible. And you do it all with grace, positive attitudes, and maybe most importantly, lots of laughs.\n\n56#Paying my dues!|It's long overdue and seems only appropriate that my first Spark award goes to all of you!   For all the collaboration, teamwork, support, awesomeness and big laughs over the past few years that I wasn't able to recognize through the platform! Glad to be part of this team!\n\n57#The Show Must Go On|10 days before WHL Forum we learned we could not have a raffle. That impacted your work and you did what was necessary to ensure we had a functioning Gratitude Bar and ALL the places the raffle had been mentioned were updated (G- Bar app and screens, mainstage, emails). Thank you for your flexibility and dedication.\n\n58#No printers? No problem.|Friends, I am so unbelievably grateful to work with you all. When we were faced with the potential that the badge printers may not work in London, this team immediately sprang into action to find an alternative solution. From finding print shops willing to take on the job, to designing badge files, to helping me talk through our options, you all made me feel confident that we would be find a resolution. I cannot thank you enough for your sense of urgency during this and it once again shows what a talented set of individuals we have on this team.\n\n59#Just past the Spotlight|Past the Spotlight, were a group of humans who spent part of the day sitting still in the background. Thank you for taking time to be part of the Spotlight episode 3 customer segment. Cheers!\n\n60#Gratitude for the Gratitude Bar Experience|We had to pivot this week to come up with a solution for the Gratitude Bar at WHL Forum. We came to an agreement on what the challenges are that we needed to solve and what the attendee experience. We sowed the seeds of a few ideas - one of which took root and now less than 24 hours later, it has blossomed into a fully vetted solution that should work for this event and many in the future. Here's to flower power!\n\n61#Driving QMR innovation!|Team, thank you so much in supporting our presentation and debrief on the April product launch. Your support and ideas are super appreciated, and led to a really effective discussion. Here's to our continued partnership.\n\n62#In the midst of brilliance|As we reflect on the resounding success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I am compelled to extend my deepest gratitude and admiration to each of you. Your leadership has been instrumental in turning a bold vision into an awe-inspiring reality, cementing its status as the premier conference for business leaders worldwide.  Your meticulous attention to every facet of the event, from pre-promotion, central, design & experience to speakers, technology, production, communications and surrounding events, has transformed ambitious ideas into a seamless experience for over 3,000 attendees. Your ability to orchestrate, collaborate, and innovate—while setting egos aside—has not only elevated our brand and the WHL \"product\" but has also reinforced our promise to the community we serve.  The dedication, creativity, and problem-solving skills you displayed were pivotal in crafting an event that not only met but surpassed expectations. The quality of the keynote speakers, the depth of the sessions, and the flawless overall execution ensured that every participant left feeling connected and inspired. Your efforts have strengthened our relationships with customers, partners, and prospects while enriching the HR community and paving the way for new opportunities in pipeline creation and customer retention. The spirit of collaboration and inclusivity you fostered has set a new benchmark for excellence and showcased the true essence of Workhuman.  I am truly grateful for your hard work, passion, and unwavering commitment to excellence. I'm so proud to have you on ALL on the team. Thank you, every one of you, for your significant contributions.   Richard\n\n63#Demo Station Love|To say I loved the self guided demo stations at WHL is an understatement. I am obsessed with them. Thank you times a million for what you put together. This was my first Workhuman Live and I was assigned to Humanair. After reviewing it a few times, I turned it from self guided to Tom guided. It was so perfect to work through all the swipes and the drill downs...and can't forget the SLOTH! It made my conversations so much more powerful...and the attendees loved it!! There is also opportunity to reuse it in the BDR world coming up and can't wait to chat more about that! Can't thank you enough for your innovation. I'm your biggest fan!\n\n64#Dream Team|Lisa and Jen, you both are such a dream to work with. You have such an incredible vision of the big picture of our events whether it be Jen with thoughtful and impactful narrative, or Lisa with the way that narrative comes to life and all connects through look and feel. I want to thank you for the way you share that vision and provide guidance, and then let me run with it! Your trust and support has made me more confident in my designs and art direction, and has created so many learning opportunities in even just the past few months. It was such a great feeling to see everything come to life with you both onsite in Austin, and I love that it ended with us getting excited about Denver over breakfast before our flight home. I am so grateful to work with you!\n\n65#Welcoming newcomers|Thank you all for your support of the Newcomers on Tour at WHL. This was a new activity this year that we developed to support a specific attendee journey. As with all new ideas, it required a lot of work behind the scenes to plan & develop and it required a lot of humanpower to pull it off onsite. Thank you to everyone who helped create and market the experience. Thank you to our hostesses who guarded the doors and shepherded the attendees onsite. And thank you to our fearless tour guides for making the experience educational and entertaining for attendees.\n\n66#Everything begins with an idea|Jen, I remember sitting in the Marriott with you and Jill almost a year ago and seeing an idea formulate in your mind. An idea about making the conference attendee-led. An idea about reducing to four tracks to allow attendees to focus. An idea about making the tracks \"spicy\" to provoke attendee interest. An idea that came to life in the most amazing way possible and lent itself to so many different facets of the event. I was then and continue to be in awe of you.\n\n67#Like a Kid in a Candy Store|That's how Workhuman Live Austin attendees felt when interacting with our new immersive demos. Thank you for going beyond your usual role to staff this area of Workhuman Central. You showed up, read your notes, played your part, made connections, learned a lot about our attendees, and helped make it the best event yet. Thank you for your commitment to the event and the business. Cheers!\n\n68#Clean up crew|Every year, after the show ends, the worst part without a doubt is the clean up. You all jumped in to ensure that our clean up went smoothly, doing everything from taking apart stands, to matching iPad serial numbers to packing crates. I know it's not glamourous, but it seriously makes our day go by so much faster and I cannot express how much we really appreciate the help!\n\n69#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders. To our magnificent events team, your ability to transform our vision into a stunning reality is nothing short of miraculous. Every detail of the event was crafted with precision, turning ambitious ideas into an awe-inspiring experiences for over 3,000 attendees. Your dedication and creativity have not only set a new benchmark for excellence but have also showcased the true spirit of Workhuman. The cross-functional execution of the Sales, Marketing, and Customer teams was crucial in weaving the rich tapestry of this event. Your efforts have fortified our brand's promise and paved the way for new opportunities in pipeline creation and customer retention. I must also acknowledge our Workhuman back-office teams - your support over the last 18 months has been the backbone of our success from procurement and legal contracts to finance and administrative champions, your relentless support ensured that every piece fell perfectly into place.  Your collective attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and commitment to inclusivity have not only enhanced our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community but also enriched the experience for every attendee. From the quality of the keynote speakers to the thought-provoking sessions and flawless execution, you all ensured that every participant left with a sense of connection and inspiration.  Thank you, each and every one of you, for your hard work, your passion, and your unwavering commitment to excellence. Here’s to your success and the continued growth of our event as a beacon for business leaders around the globe. Cheers to the entire team behind WorkhumanLive Austin!\n\n70#That’s a WRAP!|I’m so proud of this team for pulling off such an incredible Workhuman Live this year. Alana, you have stepped in and stepped up on on-site in a huge way - from hand lettering and illustration, to management of our on-site photography, working immersive demos, and jumping in wherever you’re needed. We took the customer event back in house this year, and you nailed every detail from concepting through execution, even sitting on the floor sticking hundreds of stickers to cowboy hats and chasing down vendors to make sure they got everything right during set up. Jen, having you back on team events has elevated our creative in so many ways. You think about the big picture, and how everything is connected and you’re able to maintain that big vision from start to finish. Plus, you jumped in and crafted self guided experiences for our attendees that were engaging and informative. (sloths for the win!) I am so proud and so grateful to be part of such a talented, collaborative, and FUN team. On to Denver (but don’t forget about London 😉)\n\n71#We Did It! -- Workhuman Innovation Launch|Thanks to this groups' hard work, collaboration, and innovative mindset, we were able to successfully pull off Workhuman's first product innovation launch. This required a great deal of cross-functional collaboration and I deeply appreciate how all of these teams came together and supported one another to create a stunning web page, powerful marketing campaigns, and impactful enablement for our internal teams as well as our customers.  All of this effort goes a long way towards advancing Workhuman's innovation reputation and further separating us from the competition. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\n\n72#Creating an experience that resonated|Ladies, what can I say but, 'I see the vision now'. Before anyone else, you all saw the opportunity to bring the HX community into the role of shepherd and representative to the conference experience in a major way. And while I truly made the face that was displayed to the conference and internally felt that you might regret it, you certainly were right. Attendees increasingly came up to share how seen and validated they felt in watching HX take center stage and how invigorated they were to take lessons and the power of their voices back to the workplaces to share with their organizations. I certainly couldn't have created or foreseen the impact this would have on so many and I am grateful that you trusted me to shepherd your vision out to attendees.  thank you so much for what you've done which is to create for everyone there last week the experience and feeling I had at my first Workhuman live. It matters more than you'll know.\n\n73#The ins and outs and all arounds|First time at a WHL event and to see all the details come to life is awesome. Everything felt cohesive, genuine, funny where it should be and real where it should be. Each of you put in the goods for this. Your thoughtfulness was seen and experienced. I enjoyed seeing the banners in the streets, totes out in public and in the airport, people rocking badges in the hotel elevators and many other touchpoint throughout the week. I hope you all feel proud at what you created and the impacts that were made on many, including myself.\n\n74#Thank You|Team - I want to express my sincere gratitude for your compassion and support over the past few weeks.  Thank you for all the kind messages, videos and slacks. It was hard not to be with you in Austin, but I was where i needed to be.  Thank you for covering my shifts, picking up my slack and just overall being amazing team mates.  I've been watching on social, in slack and on the app and everything I've seen tells me you put on the best Workhuman Live yet.  You all rock!  Onward to Denver.  :-)\n\n75#Writer’s Room|Thank you to the Workhuman Live Writer’s Room! I’ve always wanted a writers room and you guys delivered. Having a sounding board, a place to discuss and brainstorm, to swap ideas, to tease out difficult narratives - this is what’s makes a story come alive. We always have to balance the heart and the head with this conference. It is a balance of altruism and direct business objectives. Getting that balance right can be infuriating at times and needs a thoughtful approach. I think we got the balance right. Jen, you were juggling so many strands and so many different voices, it is a wonder you didn’t go mad! Thank you all for your diligent efforts and creative energies. Well done!\n\n76#A Gratitude Bar App is born|Team! This journey began with a vision to make the Gratitude Bar experience better, more fun, and more aligned with our product. What a vision! What a journey! Many, many months of determination, dedication, design, and development brought this dream to life. I applaud your commitment to the work (especially because it was an 'add on' project for all of you) to build a new app for use at our Gratitude Bar. I'm excited to see it IRL next week and what fun it will be for our attendees. Cheers to you!\n\n77#Final push|As we approach the finish line on the gratitude bar app, I wanted to take a moment to express my deep appreciation for this team's hard work over the past several weeks. This project has many (many) moving parts, and each member plays a crucial role in ensuring its success. Thank you all for your individual efforts, contributions, and ensuring that we are ready to have a successful Austin launch. I'm truly grateful to work with such a fantastic team!\n\n78#Building roads to build maps|I've been able to see the behind the scenes of the self guided demo you are building for WHL....and it is a world in and of itself. Data, facts, inclusion advisor, Ecomm, ROI and more...you have made crossed Ts dotted Is and made it all an enjoyable and very user friendly experience. BRAVO!\n\n79#Takeaway Thursday Intros|Jen - thanks for jumping in to create the slides and narrative to kick off Takeaway Thursday.  I'm super excited to see how these new sessions are received by our attendees.  They wouldn't be possible without your thoughtfully crafted narrative - which will begin with Keyanna's opening on Tuesday and bookend nicely on Thursday.  You're a master storyteller!\n\n80#Earning Trust|Jen - Thank you for spending time with me last week, bantering about early creative ideas. I very, very much appreciated your enthusiasm and respectful pushes. As a still, somewhat new, team member, both made me feel welcome and part of a team that wants to push one another to make great things. I appreciate it and look forward to brainstorming and dreaming up new ideas together.\n\n81#1 month from today|1 month from today, Workhuman Live 2024 will be over. That means right now you are swamped, probably stressed, maybe losing sleep, keeping track of 100 things. AND building Workhuman Live Forum, wheels turning on a couple Spotlights, plus ramping up Workhuman Live 2025. Its a lot! Keep breathing, doing great work, with FOCUS ;-) on the month ahead. The finish line is coming into view. You can do it. Thank you for your dedication, commitment, and perseverance. Best. Team. Ever.\n\n82#Welcome back…. To ALL THE THINGS|I truly appreciate you coming back from your time off ready to get back into everything. You’ve jumped on last minute calls, helped me make decisions and troubleshoot solutions, and added a little of your Jen Perry magic to everything you’ve touched. Welcome back!! We missed you!\n\n83#Spotlight: Episode 1|Thank you all for the contributions you made to this first episode of Spotlight. Whether you were in front of the camera or behind it (sometimes in the rain), this project truly takes a village. I appreciate all of you for your dedication to creating a relevant and quality broadcast.\n\n84#Q1 Spotlight last minute decisions|This group had to make a few IMPACTFUL decisions to help push Spotlight production to the finish line this week.  We used AI to help iterate on a segment title and had a quick design huddle for transitions.  No ego, no hesitation, just top notch collaboration despite a disruption to your planned Thursday.  Thanks for making it happen!\n\n85#Dream Team|Just a quick thank you to the WHL team - I had some pretty disappointing news to share on our weekly call yesterday (news I know affects all of your work in some way) and your collective support and response made that so much lighter. Thank you all for truly showing up for this teammate. In the words of Barbie, “I want to do the imagining, not be the idea\" - super grateful I get to spend time doing the imagining with you all!\n\n86#Committed|It was tough to decide the value on this award - Teamwork or Quality. So much teamwork goes into making this a success - coordinating details, understanding requests, and working together to make sure everything aligns and this team excels in that consistently. Although this was the Activate event, we all know that it was ALSO Spotlight so there was a whole other priority that was executed seamlessly. The result of all this teamwork, communications, and willingness to help each other is a truly quality event. You should all be very proud of yourselves and what you accomplished together.\n\n87#ACTIVATE Appreciation|Taking a moment to express my gratitude to this incredible group! Each of you contributed to the joy, support and camaraderie I felt at Encore this week. From deepening bonds, making new friends, being a breakouts cheerleader, or trusting the cards process (if you know, you know), I was personally touched by your kindness, teamwork, and trust. Thank you and cheers to an amazing 2024!\n\n88#Grateful for our team!|I wanted to take a moment to say how grateful I am to work alongside you, Lisa and Jen! Not only are you brilliant creatives who I'm always learning from and am inspired by, you are so much FUN! I've loved having the opportunity to work on more onsite brainstorming and creative this year, and appreciate all your efforts in making that possible. It was so exciting to envision all the possibilities onsite last week and I can't wait to keep collaborating and see it all come together! Thank you for your transparent and supportive leadership and being the best teammates <3\n\n89#GBar Jam Session|Thank you everyone for jumping in and throwing ideas around to edit and improve the overall user experience of the Gratitude Bar app! We made a ton of progress and I feel a lot more confident in the direction we are headed with this app. That might have been the longest jam session I've been in but also one of the most productive. I can't wait until we're in a position to begin usability studies and truly gauge how effective our collaborative efforts have been.  Also Jen, thank you for expanding our scope of work haha\n\n90#It takes a village|I wanted to recognize each one of you for the roles you played (you know what they are) in helping get Getty's new contract signed, sealed and delivered. From raising the right questions (Jen, Lisa), to informing of remaining download status (Kevin), providing guidance and leadership approval (Don), and negotiating and getting the paperwork through in lighting speed (Liam and Taty). Thank you all!!!\n\n91#Over the hill and through the woods to 2024 we go!|Thanks to each of you who in some way or in many ways this year have been a gift to me. From listening to me work through a problem, asked me how I was doing with a life situation, helped me figure out a project, showed me how to do something better, worked on project that we got finished, checked in on me, invited me to sit at the table, invited me into conversations, pointed out something hilarious and brought me into the joke, and just let me be me. I appreciate each of you. Hope the rest of the year is sweet and relaxing.\n\n92#Down a player, up a team.|Quick moment to say THANK YOU to all of you who jumped in and helped support during Alana's unplanned absence. From ad-hoc creative reviews, flexibility on projects and deadlines, jumping in to lend a hand, or just letting me scream into the void, you were all an amazing support this week and I could not have gotten through without you. Thank you thank you thank you!!!\n\n93#Inspirational advocacy|Jen,  I know we don't interact much as far as creating work, but I want to say thank you for being such a solid advocate for Workhuman's creative output. You communicate issues (especially delicate ones) with such candor, humanity, and sensitivity to others. I am so grateful for you sharing your perspective because the entire marketing team benefits.\n\n94#Reorg? More like WEorg!|They say change is hard. Heck, it definitely is.  BUT…. when you’re lucky enough to have a talented, engaged, and supportive group of players in the mix to work through it, together, it gets a whoooole lot easier.     Over the past several weeks, I engaged you all asking for your time and insights to support us collectively working through the “who does what, now?” of it all. Along the way, I’ve been continually impressed with how you all handled the work.  Each of you was clearly driven to make yourselves available amid all the other daily work. What’s more, along the way you all remained consistently engaged, thoughtful, open-minded, and positive in the face of working through the change.   Did we cure cancer? No. Have we solved every little thing that needs to be solved for? No. But we certainly solved for the vast majority of the most pressing aspects of the new “who does what” for our restructured creative teams. That is a major milestone and something we should all celebrate.   Thank you all for stepping up to help get this done, together. Here’s looking forward to starting of 2024 with what, to me, looks to be some of the strongest alignment we’ve ever had regarding how our Marketing creative teams are structured and what work they each support. Upward and onward!\n\n95#Coming together|Team, thank you all for coming together to figure out how we can all work better as a team, supporting each other, and our common goals.  Sometimes it’s difficult to speak up, sometimes it’s difficult to listen, yet we managed to do both and understand that we are all trying to do what we believe is the right thing.  We listened to each other, shared perspectives and concerns openly, respected each other’s opinions, and made great progress toward stronger collaboration that will lift the entire team.  I appreciate you all and can’t wait to see how things move forward.\n\n96#Cheers to your leadership|I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your leadership during this period of change. Your guidance and support have been invaluable, making the transition smoother for all of us. Thank you for your dedication to our team and for continuing to advocate for our success.\n\n97#Content Strategy & Governance Committee Kickoff|And we're off!  Big thanks to this group for joining the Content Strategy & Governance kickoff, filling out the content questionnaire with valuable insights on content challenges and solves, and for the engagement and enthusiasm about improving content visibility, messaging consistency, integrated planning, content processes - and more!  We're doing big things with content strategy as one team and I'm grateful to each one of you.  Looking forward to continued collaboration in the months to come.\n\n98#Collaborative effort for '24 Marketing Planning!|Thank you team on all your ongoing efforts with the 2024 GTM Marketing planning process these past three months. Because of all your dedication to urgency and vast detail, we are in a fantastic spot for 2024 strategy and budget scenarios. We have taken our learnings from last year, adjusted accordingly from both a preparation and execution standpoint which has allowed our internal processes to continuously improve. You all came to the Integrated workshops ready to collaborate, identify potential gaps, having those healthy problem-solving conversations to build stronger ties and making decisions for a successful 2024. In addition, the technology and headcount asks tied to different scenarios was a big lift in a month’s time and we were able to solidify our business need well within our timeline. Amazing cross collaborative effort, thank you all!\n\n99#Agency Briefing|Look at us actually holding an all-agency briefing in September! We have come such a long way - having a detailed, clear story, a look book and message, agenda - just incredible. You all did really great work in preparing and running todays call. This work, informing all agencies together, will surely be a key step in what our audience will see in April. We are all on the same page; agencies know the goals, they know their scope of work and can now collaborate efficiently to create the best WHL yet.\n\n100#Grateful for reconnecting|Hey there! Just wanted to drop by and send some love your way for that long overdue and really insightful chat we had. I really value your ideas, and hope that you know just grateful I am for all the partnership through these crazy years! Thanks for always sharing such valuable perspectives, and for your thoughtful and inclusive approach to all you do. Happy WGD my friend.\n\n101#UNLEASH World|Team! Thank you for all the work that got us to UNLEASH World. Logistics, goals, technology, creative, all sorts of emails, vendor management, and more vendor management. You brought your skills and dedication to the work; its going to be fantastique because of you. Cheers!\n\n102#Launching Workhuman's first Star Search!|Sending so much appreciation to this team for the ideas and work put in to launch our first ever internal star search! Kylie - from jumping in on day one (which was also basically your day 1!) and taking the lead, to Jillian and Helly, for your internal comms advice and magic, Jen and Jill, your edits to copy and great ideas for how this search can progress and test, and Amy, for accepting the baton when I was in need of a pass. Thank you all for your teamwork - I can't wait to see what comes of this initiative! Thank you!\n\n103#To my team on this day…|On this Gratitude Day, I would like to express my deep appreciation for the dedicated individuals who make up our awesome team. Each one of you brings a unique set of skills, ideas, and perspectives, contributing to the strength of our collective efforts. The passion and commitment you bring to your work inspires me as a leader every day. Together, we have achieved remarkable milestones, overcome challenges, and fostered an inclusive and supportive environment. Let us continue to collaborate and empower one another, celebrating our achievements and embracing the opportunities that lie ahead. Thank you for always pushing to make work human alongside me.\n\n104#It takes a village|Every one of you lent your time, expertise, or both - and I just want to say THANK YOU! Your contributions are part of the DNA that powers the new workhuman.com, and we couldn't have done it without your help. It honestly took a village of extraordinary individuals to bring this project to life with a collective effort and shared responsibility. It was a massive journey to get here, and all of you had a hand in it at some point along the way. From myself, the team, and the marketing department - a huge THANK YOU again for your support!\n\n105#A productive and fun team strategy session🙂|Just wanted to express my gratitude to everyone for a fantastic on-site this week. It was great to see you all, and take the time to hear the dedication, enthusiasm, and expertise you all bring to the team. We managed to cover some hard topics like our workload and planning, as well as some fun ones with AI and how we plan to incorporate it into our daily work. Thank you for creating an environment where everyone felt comfortable voicing their opinions: which is exactly what we needed. With this level of passion and commitment, our future is looking incredibly bright!   Thank you all for your valuable contributions and for making our team meetings a truly enjoyable and hilarious experience.\n\n106#All About Austin Awesomeness|The alliteration continues.  Thank you to this amazing, accomplished, affable, and admirable team of humans for putting together a great session to educate the sales and customer teams on Workhuman Live 2024.  Your time, attention, creativity and technical skills were both necessary and greatly appreciated!\n\n107#Everything is in FOCUS|Congrats to this crew on getting approved messaging AND lookbook for Workhuman Live. Lots of effort went into this, but it was really great to see everyone get on the same page early and drive the work forward with non-stop communication and collaboration. The very definition of focus.\n\n108#Thank you for being such great humans!|Thank you, thank you! As I wrap up week two at Workhuman, I wanted to send a big thank you to each of you for taking time out of your day to meet with me this past week. I genuinely enjoyed speaking with each of you, learning about your role, your group, how we'll be working together on Spotlights and third party tradeshows, and all the fun things. I can't wait to collaborate further in the days/weeks/months/years ahead!\n\n109#Building a Workhuman Story for the ages.|Team - I am in awe of the work you did putting together the proposed lookbook and story arc for Workhuman Live 2024.  It is no small feat to design and create content for 'the most transformative HR event' on the planet.  The work you've done is inspiring.  I know its still pending approval, but I want you all to know that the effort is seen and appreciated.    Jen - you're a visionary.  Regi & Katie - your words inspire.  Lisa - your designs are beautiful.  Kathryn & Maya - your input was key to ensuring the content hits the mark and aligns with all the right speakers.   Austin will be epic.  I can't wait to start to promote it.\n\n110#Thank you|Hello all,  Thank you so much for all the collaboration, craic and kindness during my time in WH. You have been an absolute pleasure to work with across marketing, sales and cx where everyone works so hard to do whats right to continue to drive WH to success. Thank you for the strong support of enterprise architecture and at a personal level your tremendous support to me. I would also like to thank Amie Preston who isn't on the system.  Its been an absolute pleasure and I know I will see some of you again :)!!!  Gill\n\n111#Spotlight Success: Thriving Workforce|Congratulations on yet another remarkable Spotlight activation! This time, you successfully reached a staggering 4,105 registrations, 150 customer accounts and 1,565 prospective contacts, resulting in a pipeline worth 361 million. This team's dedication was evident in every aspect, from creating compelling content and crafting scripts to ensuring a smooth flow of the show. Additionally, your efforts in securing customer interviews and promoting the event to Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) were commendable. The Spotlight property has consistently proven to be an invaluable asset in our marketing toolkit, and this quarter's show was no exception. Thank you for your hard work, and let's focus our energy on maximizing the post-show impact\n\n112#Keynote, but this time London|Jen - another fabulous keynote and round of getting to work with you closely to prepare for Eric’s keynote at the WHL regional forum in London! You are so good at your craft and so much fun to work with. From early on reps to on-site coordination and last minute prep it’s always smooth and you’re a true pro.  I so enjoyed watching how all of the content landed with the European market and can’t wait for the next time around! Thank you!!\n\n113#Challenger, a valiant team effort!|Team – It has been such a pleasure to work with this group on both the Challenger sales deck development and Calibrate event planning. The entire team has been specifically focused on this strategic goal and understanding the company’s investment with the Challenger enablement initiative. I have learned so much from working with you all and it’s really so rewarding to see all the moving parts and teams starting to come together, including the Challenger mindset and methodology, the onboarding, and roll out during the July workshops. I wish you the very the best with this ongoing effort and eager to see this evolve throughout the company!\n\n114#Decisions, decisions....|Thank you for all the last minute decisions while we we're on site in London. From badge design tweaks to what was for dinner, I really appreciated having you around!\n\n115#WHL Forum - An Only Workhuman Can Do Event!|Team, I want to express my sincere appreciation and take a moment to recognize you for the remarkable team effort that made the first-ever WHL Forum in London an extraordinary success this week. The energy and dedication you poured into planning and executing this event from garnering 591 registrations, and securing inspiring speakers, thought-leaders in Dan Health, and customers from Sanofi and bp to localizing the event creative, sourcing local entertainers with the “Showstoppers”, and executing a seamless and flawless logistical plan — you were all truly exceptional.   Your passion, expertise, and collaborative spirit showed our mission and values on center stage! We created a perfect balance between knowledge-sharing and networking, leaving everyone feeling enriched and motivated - evident in how we captivated our audience and ignited their passion for creating a positive workplace culture (reinforced with our data) while allowing participants to actively engage, learn, and exchange ideas with their peers.    Your collective efforts helped support our annual business goals by creating an opportunity to engage with 72M in active pipeline across 15 opportunities, 27 customer accounts representing 280M in annual billings, 4 media interviews onsite, and 30 product demos with high-end brands like Rivian, Pearson, Lacoste, and Virgin Media. Beyond the numbers, we created a solid brand reputation in the market. You have all made a significant impact on the success of the Workhuman Live Forum, and I am grateful to have such an exceptional team by my side.   You should all feel really proud of what we accomplished this week! Thank you\n\n116#Push it!|New pitch deck is coming along really well, and as always a monumental team effort. Jen, i wanted to send gratitude for helping to evolve the copy to a place that feels more urgent yet genuine. As well as hunting through old slide decks and stock images to bring in some drama. Liu, thank you for jumping in at the 11th hour to help bring a consistent brand lens and visual motif. This project has jumped really far ahead in the past 2 days with this team effort, thank you!\n\n117#Creative All-Stars|It was really hard to pick just one value for this, because it truly could have been any of them. I wanted to take a minute to say a HUGE thank you to both of you for all of the work you did while I was on maternity leave. There were a lot of balls in the air, and neither of you let a single one drop. From promo, to onsite, driving forward the execution for London, you both really knocked it out of the park (going hard on the sports metaphors here). Knowing that I had incredibly capable support while I was out made my leave so much less stressful, and for that I am truly grateful.\n\n118#All the odds and ends|Just wanted to take a minute to thank you both for all of your help with WHL and Unleash. From logos, to badges, to activations, you were both instrumental in getting the job done, no matter the request. Thank you both for your support, assistance, and friendship along the way!\n\n119#No panic, Jen to the resue|Loop panic - gone! Thank you for jumping in and fixing things from afar in record timing!  We so appreciate you!!\n\n120#You Crushed it!|To this incredible group of humans who made the WHL breakout sessions run flawlessly.... THANK YOU from the bottom of my soul. Many of you lived through the \"challenges\" we experienced last year, and for those who didn't you heard about it, so you new the nerves were running high. Clearly working technology is always a huge help, but that's just the ticket for entry.  It's all of you who kept the flow of attendees happy, directing them to the right spots, giving them a smile and a feeling that you were there just for them. Honestly...Walmart has nothing on this team! I'm so incredibly grateful for all of your support, even when you weren't scheduled so many of you jumped in to help as needed.  Simply the best!!!\n\n121#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.  Your efforts created an unforgettable experience for over 1,500 attendees and reconfirmed our event as the world's leading HR conference.  Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention. Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n122#Keynote Presentation = PERFECTION|Eric's keynote presentation was pure perfection!!  It had the right balance of humor, insights, client stories, compelling topics, pop culture, and masterful subliminal product placement. The images, script, timing, and flow were excellent.  I loved it in San Diego and appreciate it even more having watched the recording.  I will be using it as a guide for my future interactions with prospects.   Okay....I guess I should give Eric a bit of credit for the spot-on delivery....but we can't forget the creative genius behind the scenes!!\n\n123#Vegas bound|When we needed a last minute banner for Unleash, you jumped on a call so we could talk it through. Awesome graphic, quick response, and it was on its way to Dublin for implementation. Thank you, team!\n\n124#A screen about a screen|Jen - thank you for making the last thing yet to be assigned for WHL onsite screens. You are swamped. The team is swamped. You jumped in and made the last new file yourself. Thank you for great teamwork!\n\n125#Making time|Thanks for making time on this sunny Friday for an unplanned presentation to leadership. With so much going on (as is 'the way it is' this close to WHL) I appreciate you finding time in your day on top of all the deadlines. Cheers!\n\n126#Making the Invisible Visible|Team. I'm so proud of you. I'm also so excited that this day is here. You have all worked tirelessly and meticulously over the last nine months to finalize a new set of video and TV commercials. I remember going back to the initial concept meetings where we discussed the various themes, putting each through rigorous testing, building the cast, determining the characters and locations, writing the scripts, scoping the work for things we'd never done before (i.e., VFX graphic removal of human limbs), to building the distribution plan. We solved challenges, dealt with the complexity and unknown, and conquered obstacles. What an incredible achievement. We always said, \"if we're not proud of the work, we don't move forward\". I'm proud of the work and proud of you. I truly believe that this asset will have an incredible impact on the individuals in the workplace - especially those who currently feel invisible. I believe it will give people the courage to raise their hands/challenge the status quo/ and put Workhuman at the forefront of cultural change within workplaces around the world. Thank you for all doing your parts and for collectively leading and collaborating. Thank you for working through every single milestone together.\n\n127#Taking meh to a-meh-zing|Jokes aside..thanks for directing a design to make it so much better. A quote from CD Andrew Lincoln made me think of you, “I work with art directors, copywriters, and developers and hope to inspire them to work as hard as they can to create the best work they can. I make sure that when we present work to the clients, we're bringing them the best work.”  The Events shirt project in particular had me at an ah ha moment of not only final look but why it was being made in that way AND doing it all in one color. Thanks for taking time to teach and break things down. It matters lots.\n\n128#Marketing Target Architecture Heroes!|Hello everyone  Strategy >> Business Capability Map >> Maturity Assessment across Technology, Process, People, Data >>Target Architecture>>Multi-year Roadmap  Thank you to each and every one of you for your engagement, collaboration and excellent inputs into the stages above that have ultimately led to the Marketing Target Architecture and Multi-year Roadmap. We will refine aligning to capacity forecasts to execute in 2023 and drive solid investment planning for 2024 and beyond.  With gratitude and appreciation :)  Gill\n\n129#Remember Activate?|Activate? It's in the rear view mirror for this team because before/during/after Kick Off is all WHL and all of the other events we are busy planning. But I didn't want to forget to thank you all for the huge contribution you all made in making it such a successful event. I chose Quality for this award because it was the outcome but the true sense of teamwork each of you live every day on every project is what gets this result. I appreciate each and every time one of you raises their hand to take on another thing when you see your teammates drowning. I am so grateful to be on this team with such professionals.\n\n130#You are a gift|Jen you are a gift that keeps on giving. You have the ability to make people feel seen, valued, and heard. You immediately welcome conversation, challenge change, guide, offer feedback the list goes on. You have the ability to paint pictures with words, make people laugh, and remind us we are not a croissant 🥐. It has been so fun to connect in person and the surprise and delight that comes with every conversation. Your knowledge, laughter, and guidance is truly appreciated. Thank you!!!\n\n131#Oh so Shiny!|Jen and Lauren, thank you for your quick support this week to turn a few average powerpoint decks into utter masterpieces!  Your keen eye for the story – through words, flow, and design, helps everyone have a much better understanding of the content in such a clear way.  I really appreciate you jumping in the help pull it all together and add all that shiny!\n\n132#Absolutely adore alliteration|It's not often we get to work together, so I was very excited to pull you for a chat to rift off one another for the naming of a very important initiative. You shared some great insights along with a winning name that immediately hooked me, and my team (I have since shared!) 🙌🏼 We appreciate your creative mind and for being open to collaborating on this monumental resource. You've surely made your mark on it! This name fits the bill so perfectly. We're thrilled to be moving forward with this and launch to our humans next month! 🤩\n\n133#Activate execution at its finest|Team, you did it, it was incredible, and I’m proud to say we’re back!  We concluded Activate 2023 – bringing back an in person sales and customer kickoff after 3 years of hiatus.  I know you all went through months of preparation and planning, dotting “I’ crossing “T’s”, creating virtual, in-office, and in-person experiences, filming and facilitating Differentiator workshops, and more. You executed flawlessly, dealt with challenges without hesitation and ensured all our humans were informed with comprehensive communications throughout the event and fun well-thought-out games that allowed for maximum retention of our strengths. You created in-office experiences, provided an environment for everyone to thrive and engage, and you all put your best selves forward.  Thank you for always upping your game and never settling for the status quo. You did it and did it exceptionally well.  Thank you!\n\n134#Agility, Resilience, Teamwork|Kind of a cliche title for an award. These terms are used frequently in the corporate world and are mostly said but not practiced. You  all show these qualities every day in everything you do. The collaboration, kindness, understanding, and respect that you show each other day is what makes this team great and has a palpable impact on the events we produced. We have a huge first quarter coming up and will surely face all the pressures that live events bring. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all for the work you have done and the work you will do. The culture you have created will get us through it all and create incredible events.\n\n135#Brand partnership|Early this year, we kicked of this little project. It started with a new set of commercials to tell compelling stories and help build brand recognition. We ideated, we did testing, we built a strategy, we got alignment, we storyboarded and scripted, we casted, shot, and continue to edit and refine and play with sound and special effects.... Somewhere in there we increased the scope to include the exploration of a new template system that would enhance our marketing, and that grew to a wider design and identity system refresh... and while we were at it we said, well lets land the company messaging and narrative for the year, and distill that down into copy and tone enhancements and direction to ensure have a cohesive message and voice in marketing and beyond... And we did this while nailing our day-to-day marketing goals, growing and evolving our team, and learning how to be humans IRL vs Zoom.   Team, I don't know that I can find the words to express my gratitude for what you have helped accomplish thus far. Today's presentation was a fundamental milestone confirming leadership alignment. This allows us to move into the major executional phases that make it real. You should all be so proud.  Now I simply can't capture it all, but thanks for: Jen & Lauren for concepting and messaging; Owen for commercial scripts and video direction;  Regi & Katie (and our freelance team) for pushing copy and tone;  Liu, Carrie, Kevin, Tyler for pushing design; and Christina Pinkus for driving a major initiative with precision and grace.   And of course Richard. None of this happens without an incredible leader like you, who isn't afraid to innovate and push and ultimately trust in a team to bring their best work to life. Thank you.\n\n136#CMS means \"Co-workers Making Success\"!|Jen, Moe, and Stacy, We have some biiiiig work ahead of us in 2023, and an area that will help us plan and scale is the work we are doing together with the CMS.  Thank you for your partnership, your time, your ideas, and your willingness to try stuff so we get this system where we need it as the backbone for website success.!\n\n137#Nevertheless|...she persisted. I was appreciating Lisa and her focus on Events (including process ;-), when I realized this is the first time we've had a dedicated, truly dedicated, CD of Events. Jen and Liu had the title but always with other competing priorities. You championed for this role for... years. Thank you for your persistence - identifying the need and defining this important role. Cheers!\n\n138#That's a wrap!|That’s a Wrap! Congratulations to this extremely talented group! Today, you wrapped up an exhaustive 5 day commercial and photo shoot. We know deep down in our gut that we’ve created and captured something very special and ground-breaking this weekend - it’s now all about stitching it together.   Thank you Maureen (for leading this group) and, Owen, and Lauren for working closely with Wayne to bring this entire concept to life – full green screen suits, placing hidden treasures throughout scenes, advising on script delivery, actor placement, and more! Liu and Kevin,  the photography strategy and on-site capture will fuel surrounding campaign assets for years to come - MicroManage.work could also be a huge hit. Chris Claude, the behind scenes content capture will excite our employee base and always remind us of the good laughs, the risks we took, and our collaborative team spirit - award submissions here we come. Christina, we would not be at this stage without - thank you for keeping us on track and on goal. Z and Jenn, thank you for focusing on the future narrative and campaign strategy and for the integration of this work (concept to assets) into our future activation plans.   On to Post-production. Stay the course, team - we have something great!\n\n139#Making the Impossible, Possible|Marketing team and partners - Congratulations on achieving a monumental milestone of 50,000 Marketing Qualified Leads! By the numbers, this milestone represents two-year growth from 8,000 in 2020 to 50,636 (and climbing)! That’s an incredible 532% increase in demand growth in just two years' time!     The journey to this massive accomplishment started back in October 2021 with thoughtful and intense demand and brand planning, pragmatism of breaking big goals into smaller channel by quarter forecasts and plans, followed by superior discipline around performance management week on week, and critically aided by our partnerships with Sales Ops, Analytics, and Enterprise Architecture.     From web leads, to webinars, social surrounds, press amplification, Spotlights, and countless hours refining the leads scoring and ingestion models, this was a department wide effort through and through. As impressive as this achievement of goal (ahead of schedule) is, more than the outcome itself, it’s demonstrative of your collective discipline, collaboration, and commitment to quality execution. We’ve learned much from this journey that will inform and enable success in fy23 and beyond.     On behalf of the Senior Exec Leadership Team, congratulations on making the impossible, possible!    -Tom\n\n140#Off to a great start!|Team,  Thank you all for taking time out of your busy week to attend the website and digital journey kick-off sessions. You were deeply involved in and committed to the beginning of this transformational change, and all brought exceptional expertise and engaging conversations.   This is only the first step in a long journey, but with your commitment and partnership, I am confident we are quickly on the road to success! Thank you again for a great start!\n\n141#Straight on to San Diego|Thank you all for jumping in during my first week and taking time out of your busy schedules to talk to me about all things WHLSD. It has been invaluable to get your perspectives, insights, and historical knowledge as I get up and running in my new role. Looking forward to partnering with all of you as we continue to build towards San Diego in April!\n\n142#Leader goodness|Video says it all.\n\n143#Team time|Alright so we are no longer on the same team per se but that is besides the point. It was very refreshing to sit down in person and talk with you both. It reminds me why I felt so welcomed when I first started.   Thank you for both pushing to make this happen. Thank you Jen for the ATL swag, your wisdom, story telling, and your care for others. Alana thanks for your honesty, insight, and realness. You both rock so much!\n\n144#Strategic Planning ROCKSTARS!|Team,  Van Gough once said \"great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" Each of you brought your ideas, your energy, and a spirit of collaboration to the strategic planning sessions this week, which will unequivocally set our marketing organization up to do great things in 2023. It was a large commitment of your time and your active engagement with the goal of developing a collective and transparent foundation for next years plan. So, a sincere thanks to all for both making that commitment and demonstrating that together we can, and will continue to, deliver as a true team.  Tom\n\n145#Thanks for Participating in #plantbased!|Happy International Vegan Day! I appreciate your participation in the #plantbased channel, for sharing both your curiosity and knowledge about plant-based food!\n\n146#Helping to brand experiences|A huge thank you to this group that came together quickly to aid the Storefront team on the journey of branding our experiences offering within the Store.  You all jumped on the chance to talk, asked great questions, and brought things to life that we hadn't even remotely considered yet.  And to top it all of, you turned around a proposal just a week later for us that will be how we move forward!  This was a fantastic example of teams removing silos and coming together to drive great outcomes - thank you so much for your partnership and guidance!\n\n147#LIVE is Live!|Bringing Workhuman Live to the market for promotional launch is no small feat.  It takes a team … it takes YOU!  Congratulations, team.  This week we launched our Workhuman Live 2023 website, registration, and promotional campaign and off on a 6-month journey to bring 4500 HR and Business leaders together in San Diego next April.  What began as a look-book, turned into a full site experience and creative platform that is engaging, energizing, and a bringing forth a bit of fun too.  You delivered on early speakers and keynotes, a framed-out agenda, simplified registration approach, new video sizzle, and a fully integrated media campaign.  Did we have some challenges along the way – of course.  But that’s where the teamwork comes in, to problem solve and keep moving forward.  We are starting from a position of strength with over 400 early birds signed up, and momentum is in our favor as we head into the fall campaigns.  Well done to the whole team – without you, Live does not live.\n\n148#Part 1: Plan the Work|Part 2: Work the Plan. Excited to celebrate and recognize this cross-functional group's efforts as we exit Q3, head toward Q4, and chart a path to more growth in 2023. You've all together demonstrated great teamwork, autonomy, leadership, healthy challenge and debate, and a disciplined and data-driven approach to 2023 draft plans which will ultimately be vetted with partner teams to form the basis for strong operating plans aimed at New Customer Growth, Customer Retention, Innovation, and an ongoing focus of putting the human in Workhuman. Congrats on great progress in Part 1. Excited to finalize it and head toward Part 2! -With gratitude, Richard and Chris\n\n149#Expert lens|Jen, thank you for taking time to recently meet with me and my team to review opportunities to more strongly align Customer Central to our Workhuman brand. We all appreciated your perspective and feedback and feel energized about making improvements to the user experience as we continue building out the site. Thank you for your respect for teamwork!\n\n150#2023 Strategy Session #1|Team - thank you for spend the afternoon together in an engaging discussion around brand, content and comms strategy. While we didn't get through the entire agenda, I am grateful for the sharing, learning and dialogue that took place. Your input will help shape future sessions as we continue through this journey, building stronger ties between our respective teams and making decisions that help us operate more efficiently and move the department and ultimately, the business forward. I hope you're as energized and excited as I am about making more progress over the next several weeks to finalize our strategic marketing plan for 2023. THANK YOU ALL!\n\n151#You are excellent at......|letting people know. Letting them know a thing about themselves that you see as awesome. Letting them know that you thought of them and why it mattered. Letting them know a thing they may love and why you thought of them to share said thing. Letting them know why they matter. Thank you. Wanted to let you know you rock!\n\n152#Got a Minute?|I call on all of you so often, asking for a minute of your time that usually turns into 15 or 30 - sometimes even a lot longer. And you all always say yes, making time to collaborate, provide feedback, bounce ideas around. Thank you for your generosity - of your time and your thoughtful insights. I appreciate you for your constant support that helps me through business decisions, improving projects, and sometimes just everyday life.\n\n153#Weekend dig for photos|Late Friday we learned from Sanofi that they wanted to hear our ideas for recognition and their sponsorship of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Tom, you had the brilliant idea of a co-branded gratitude bar, which led us to looking for inspiring images. Knowing our proclivity for photos, I reached out to the crack WH Live team on Saturday morning, and winning pics were found. We used the images Jill and JenP that you dug up and sent, with feedback \"you 100% met the brief in terms of the Olympic brief\". The speed and urgency that this team responded was critical in pushing us closer to becoming a client. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to act with urgency. It mattered!\n\n154#Bringing a Spark to our Customers|Not actually finished at all...but we're launched and more prepared for the next round! I cannot thank you all enough for your dedication and support in this process. The progress made in just 4 weeks is astounding. Maureen, Jen, and Christina, this could not have happened without your expertise and commitment to the cause. Carrie and Kevin - the design of these comms is so refreshing and different from what we're used to, I can't wait to see how you continue to evolve them. Lauren, Rachel, Traci, and Melanie, you all lent your expertise and knowledge to help make this what it is and I'm so excited to continue working with you on all things customer. Tom, Chris F, Chris D, Richard, Derek, and Amy - your leadership, support, and trust in all of us helped us move fast and get results. Miranda your enthusiasm out of the gate helped keep me motivated through it all. THANK YOU! Can't wait to keep going.\n\n155#Testing! Testing! 1-2-3!|Thanks all for helping with device and location testing for Spotlight. Your monitoring helped us identify any issues and aided in a flawless broadcast!\n\n156#Work Smarter We Said. We just did!|A year and a half ago, we promised each other that we’d go into ad testing during the development phase of new WH commercials - to ensure we put a higher quality and insight-driven concept into the market. Today, that promise has become a reality. Thank you all for staying on the path, for delivering and collaborating with each other, and for all producing the latest animatics for testing. I’m so excited to see the results and which concept \"proves out\". We know we've got more work to make these great and hopefully this change in \"how we work\" will make the next phase more focused and efficient.\n\n157#Spotlight Q3|As we finalize the final final final edits of the spotlight talk show, I want to recognize the collective effort of this team. From the theme development, run of show creations, script writing, speaker sourcing and selection, project management, show production, technical tests, show video edits, marketing promotion, internal viewing party activation & comms to all the areas I’m not even aware of. You’ve planned the work and worked the plan so the final show is going to be great and you should all be proud of what we’ve delivered. Now, let’s go execute it on Tuesday! Oh, we've got 7K+ people registered! Let's go.\n\n158#Total team effort on ad testing recordings|Thank you everyone for volunteering your time to be included in our ad testing recordings for the commercial concepts. Owen & Chris, thank you for scouting out the best location and setting up tech in our Framingham office. Cathy, thank you for calling in to play our remote character Siobhan (quite literally). Lauren & Owen, your input on each characters tone and creative direction has really put these animatic boards to life for our ad testing efforts. Amazing teamwork all around!\n\n159#Green Light!|After a month of due diligence, analyzing the market, questioning prior work and strategies, you formed a strong narrative on how we should go to market in H2 and beyond with a new commercial campaign strategy.  You developed really exciting concept territories that aligned perfectly to our business and product and today you presented your work to senior leadership…. AND got the green light to advance! Congratulations. Now, storyboards, testings, and scripting - it will take a village  Let’s go!\n\n160#Lights! Camera! Action!|Jen and Jill, thank you both for organzing an incredible shoot today at Cramer for WH Spotlight. From pre-production planning to script writing to on the ground advisory roles. Nailing this really difficult and nessary topic is naunced and requires both productive excellence and strategic narrative excellence - you gave Workhuman the best chance at acheiving and capturing both of those today! Great work\n\n161#So if you do the math....|we just bought ourselves 80 hours. I like that ROI. Thank you for investing in the planning process and each other this week. It may feel like we barely scratched the surface, but there were a lot of good discussions and new ways of thinking over our two days together. We have lots to dig into together but I'm excited! I appreciate being on this journey with this team. Thanks again!\n\n162#Turning vision into value|From when I started 2 months ago until now, each of you has been instrumental in laying the framework for the evolution of the Executive Forum. Your leadership, advice, and trust in me in such a short time has been humbling and is deeply appreciated. As a group, thank you for your overarching leadership and strategic input throughout my tenure thus far as we begin to harness the potential of the Exec Forum and shape it into an effective tool for achieving our business goals. Individually, I have been moved by:   Jill, Jeff & Richard – your fearless leadership, patience, flexibility, and guidance along the way, when your plates are beyond full. You continue to rise to the challenge every day, and it is inspiring to watch.  Eileen, Jen R, Tom & Celia – your vision and commitment to the success of the Exec Forum as witnessed by your strategic feedback and mobilizing outreach by your respective teams   Chris & Chase – your steadfast commitment to keeping things moving forward, positioning Workhuman at the forefront of thought leadership, and capitalizing on the momentum built in Atlanta  Amy & Jen P – your strategic and creative feedback, guidance, and mentorship in the moments woven between the To Do List items  Kathryn & Abby – your innate ability to collaboratively help me turn vision to value within your respective roles while simultaneously juggling your numerous other responsibilities. I am grateful for your time and for showing up and prioritizing the Exec Forum  Though we are just getting started together, we have already made great strides - which is cause to celebrate. Thank you for all that you do. Here's to the next phase!\n\n163#Idea Machine|Whenever I think about writing you a recognition it starts to sound like some weird love letter you'd get from a stalker. I am constantly in awe of all of things you take on, understand, and make great. WH Applied (and I know that's not a real name) was an idea without an owner and you adopted it, made it real, made it fun - all having to play the hand you were dealt.  You never stop coming up with great ideas, you overcome every obstacle, you deal with every tiny decision that has to be made. I love that you give everything you have to making this great and I love that we get to do it together.\n\n164#If you could just reinvent the wheel - every year!|Jen, there are great creative partnerships in history, Lennon and McCartney, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Simon and Garfunkel, Orville and Wilbur Wright – but when we hit our stride, it’s like magic! We’ve worked together on many keynotes, but there is no doubt that we have got better and better with each passing year. They always feel like one cohesive narrative and tone. You really shined on this one, taking a lead and delivering content that spoke to exactly what we wanted to get across. We had a mission for this keynote and we had some key messages to hit.  It all came together in the end and I don’t think it could have gone better! Thank you for all your incredible work, you make us all shine!\n\n165#The Me for the We|Congratulations on a remarkable WHL Atlanta! Transparently, I struggled with this recognition as no amount of words would accurately summarize how I feel about each and every one of you. So, I’ll keep it short. Good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We. Your leadership throughout the planning and execution of WHL Atlanta was on show in full force and everyone was witness to its greatness. Your impact on the Workhuman business is immeasurable. Your collaboration and communication in good and tough times were timely and evident. Your impact on 1,500+ people was visibly life-changing (evident from “ugly cries to ugly laughs” and the glowing smiles throughout the event).   In the famous words of Nelson Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done!” I'm super proud of you.\n\n166#A masterclass in leadership...|I want thank you all for your impeccable leadership. Although this was my first year leading registration, badges, check-in, and returning to in-person events for the first time in 3 years, you all showed poise, trust, and compassion through what can only be described as a tumultuous process. In my 10+ years with Workhuman, this was the most confident and supported I’ve ever felt taking on a new project, especially one so publicly visible. You led me through all of the checks and balances and answered what I estimate to be north of 10,000 questions along the way. Every interaction was based on ensuring not only the success of the event but my own personal success and I cannot express how much this has meant to me. Even when tensions were high and frustration got the better of me, you remained focused on the goal and even justified the need for frustration at times. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for not only your help and guidance, but for allowing me to bring as much of myself into this event as possible. I have no doubt that we will continue to accomplish great things as a team and I look forward to taking on the next challenge, together!\n\n167#\"May\"king moments that matter!|Ok apologies for the bad play on words there.  Just once again wanting to thank you all for your participation in the Welcome Human program.  I hear time the same thing consistently from our new humans, how amazed by this program they are and how much they appreciate everyone taking the time to host a session.  They learn so much much about Workhuman and feel valued and welcome.  Thank You again form the new hires and from me!\n\n168#Call in the experts..|Richard, Maureen, Jen… as we get ready to go live with our external employer brand social campaign, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize and thank you for your contributions to getting us here. Richard, your level of governance and oversight in setting up the vendor measurements was invaluable. Maureen your support for us trying something a little different form a brand perspective and input into our final creative was truly appreciated. Jen, your energy and creativity in our early concept phase helped set the tone for the campaign, as well as some other initiatives we plan to integrate into our overall EB refresh, again was a key factor in where we have landed. I know you all have some much going on so your time and support on all of this means a lot. This was one of the first cross functional project groups I was involved in when I started back in November and it really brought home the quality of our humans and their deep expertise in their relevant areas, it was a brilliant induction into my Workhuman life. Thank you all.\n\n169#You are the master, Jen Perry!|I'm pretty sure your name is on this list of master storytellers.  If not, it should be.  Thank you, my friend, for you help with the Teams Webinar.  You're eloquence knows no bounds.  And, you certainly take shiny to a new level on powerpoints.  You bring the Workhuman Live experience to life, and I so appreciate your help in preparing our teams for a great experience in Atlanta!\n\n170#Jumping Right In!|Thank you so much Jen for jumping in to cover the Welcome Human session for your team at the last min!  I know with Atlanta Live looming your super busy, so I'm even more appreciative.  The session with your team is always a highlight as we love the commercials and the \"sizzle\" reel about all the recent projects.   Just great fun for a Friday morning!  THANKS again!\n\n171#I don't know who else to ask!|Jen, I can't thank you enough for being my \"go-to\" person the past few weeks for everything WH Live. I know you have a million things on your plate and not once have you hesitated to respond to my skype or email (or call!). Not surprisingly, you almost always know the answer, and if you don't...you've quickly connected me with the correct people. I can't wait to see all of your visions come to life and I look forward to partnering with you again in the near future. Thank you, my friend!!!\n\n172#Building Our Story|Team, Thank you for your help and support on the Accenture partnership workshop and your thought leadership.  It was a tight timeline with lots of materials needed.  I feel so fortunate to work with this team that's not afraid to roll up their sleeves and think big together.  Each of you played an important part in building out our story and shaping the opportunities ahead.  Thank you for understanding and seeing the importance of the workshops and activities.  There will be much more to come.  Thank you for being a part of this journey with me!\n\n173#Thank You So Very Much!|I can't thank you enough for helping me create a special moment, especially one that had some time sensitivity attached to it.  Recently during a couple meetings with TTEC, our 'Human Portraits' went over incredibly well, both with the Chief People Officer and Global Employee Engagement Manager.  They mentioned how great it would be if they had something like that, and with a quick email and phone call to the both of you...voila.  You helped me pull together a custom 'Human Portrait' for them, using their colors and logo.  The initial reaction was pure excitement.  Maybe it will be something that they adopt, and will forever make them think of their future partner in Workhuman.  Thank you so very much!\n\n174#Thank you doesn't say enough!|Welcome Human Presenters.  Just wanted to share some feedback with you.  I challenged our new hires to post how they are feeling about their Welcome Human experience in one word of Giphy.  Here are some of the words I got:  •\tfamily •\tcollaboration  •\tteamwork  •\tinformative  •\tlearning  •\tamazing  •\tsupportive  Each month I have more than one new hire tell me they have never had such a great/extensive experience with onboarding.  I hear similar expressions of amazement and gratitude every session.  So first – BIG SHOUT OUT TO CRAIG for putting this program together.. I’m just literally following the path he set out.  And a huge thank you to you all for your time. When working to schedule sessions each month and seeing your calendars I get a glimpse into how busy you all are.. making me even more appreciative of your willingness to share your time!  THANK YOU THANK YOU!\n\n175#Driving our brand strategy within our Commercials!|To the amazing brand strategy team,  As we have started to dig into the creative development on our next campaign of H2 commercials and video content, I am so grateful to be working with this team and creating such amazing work. The past two weeks have included numerous working sessions, both with our agency partners and also internally, and it’s so great to see the creative juices flowing! We are moving in the right direction, taking our learnings from last year’s assets, and making this strategy even stronger as a full campaign to really drive our brand awareness by creating an amazing story with such memorable characters. I cannot wait to see this come to life, thank you for all your great teamwork and continued collaboration.\n\n176#Simply the best|Jen, I couldn’t have asked for a better mentor/swim partner on this Olympic-size pool that is WHL. Since I joined the team barely a month ago, you’ve been amazing to collaborate with and learn from, you’re always just a slack or email away to guide, give feedback, exchange ideas and build up my confidence. As I’ve said on your SM award, your mind blows my mind in the best possible way. I’m so grateful to have joined with you on this journey – thank you for being you.\n\n177#WHW Takes a Village|Thank you all for presenting today at Workhuman Wednesday. You are all doing such great work and did a fantastic job showcasing it to the company. A special shout out to our newest teammates - Corri & Kathryn. I can't wait until May where we can share it together in person.\n\n178#Did I leave the gas on? No, I'm a squirrel!|Jen, I can't possibly understand how it's taken me this long to award you for literally ALL of the things you do. I've bothered you a million times, interrupted more than that, had 10,000 questions and at least 35-40 terrible ideas. Not once have you been anything other than the epitome of accommodating, understanding, and \"yes, and-ing\" to even the worst of my ideas. I've said it before and I'll say it again, you make my heart happy and you are certainly on the short-list of people that make all of the difficult time, more than worth the struggle. We are all better for your contributions and NONE of what we do would be possible without you! Thank you!!\n\n179#Spotlight Success|Team – what a massive win on today’s Workhuman Spotlight event!  It was an absolute thrill to watch it.  Thank you for the ingenuity and reimagination that went in to concepting and planning this new ‘talk show edition’ format, and for all of the detailed execution that went into todays broadcast.  You all nailed it!  From audience acquisition, to garnering fantastic talent for the show, to the ‘on the Streets of New York’ segment which I thought was a hit, to the carefully constructed questions and content to highlight the many opportunities and challenges facing HR today, not to mention the flawless streaming, it all came together extremely well and showcased our natural place as thought leaders and drivers of this important ‘future of work’ conversation.  Steve – you handled the job of navigating the conversations with Laurie, Steve and yes, even the unscripted Gary Vaynershuk too, like an absolute pro.  I’m excited about the demand this event will undoubtedly drive in the final weeks of Workhuman Live Atlanta registration, and equally as optimistic about our prospects for more Spotlight events and format testing in the future.   Thank you to this cross-functional team of trailblazers and innovators, and congratulations on a fantastic event!\n\n180#Pivot to Taking Action|Plans change and we pivoted to action. Last week, we had a request for a gratitude bar at WHL and within 5 days this team produced 3 options with renderings and activations pros / cons. Thank you for actioning this so quickly, for considering operational/logistical/ experiential nuances, and for producing a viable option for approval.\n\n181#Spotlighters|You are not the ones on stage. You are backstage working to make the spotlight shine on our speakers, guests, content, message, brand - all the things. Workhuman Spotlight - talk show edition is 2.5 weeks away. The recording is done. The work is far from done. I see you, working on this on top of your other work and our other events (Hello? Atlanta!). You are right on your spot doing what is needed. Thank you for your dedication, stamina, and commitment to the events, the team, the business. Cheers!\n\n182#WHL Theme — You Rallied|Kevin, Lauren and Jen. Our gut said that hasnt landed the new postion for WHL yet - we knew it wasnt ready to be shared. Instead of retreating, you rallied. You instantly put pen to paper and paper into design - you test, edited, changed, executed. This attitude fuels creativity and resutls. Regardless of how this works out - im proud of how you tackled this project.\n\n183#In the Spotlight|Team, Wow! The Spotlight shoot today was amazing. As a team, we spoke a lot about due diligence and dotting our “i’s” and crossing out “T” and today you proved that we did exactly that. We captured incredible content from well prepared speakers alongside a world class crew. It’s our collective effort that will allow this content and our message to spread across the world! Thank you for dedication, focus on quality, and commitment to getting us to this point. Proud moment. #progress. Thank you\n\n184#Preparation = Progress|Team, thank you for preparing the WHL presentation for my meeting today with Eric. It’s the preparation, the educational / context setting calls/texts/slacks that give me the confidence to represent the vision (with the details). We’re building momentum and these are critical updates for the business and how we progress forward. Thank you\n\n185#IGNITE22|Thank you Eric for your inspirational IGNITE22 keynote. First… I loved the video intro. I confess to watching it a few times as it was so uplifting and it was such a nice touch to end on the personalized signature. Who thought it could be so fun to look back at 2020? Jen did.. And she was right! As someone mentioned in the chat, \"humor - such a human thing!\" It's so true and it's just one of the ways humanity was threaded throughout your talk. I loved how you incorporated Workhuman speakers from throughout the years, it nice moment of nostalgia for those who were there, and a way to introduce newer folks into our incredible Workhuman community. The dancing video, still has legs - it was a hit. Love the message around our water - making work more human, and the exciting milestones, life events, and innovations. Ending on the quote from Shawn Achor was beautiful. A few of the comments from the chat… \"So excited for 2022!\" \"Thank you so much for your inspiration!\" \"Together, we can do anything!\" Thank you!\n\n186#Mic Drop Moments on the Regular|Jen & Maureen - I want to recognize you for the recent conversation that we had with the LinkedIn B2B Edge think-tank on brand positioning strategy. In that meeting and frankly SO MANY other meetings, I am inspired by your mic-dropping thoughtful comments. I wish your words could hang even longer in silence as we all soak them in--be it a partner meeting with LinkedIn or a marketing leadership team meeting. I look forward to listening and absorbing more from you in the future!\n\n187#Didn't know how much I needed that|Jen and Alana....I'm so grateful you were both were up for coming in to meet up with me whilst I got my new laptop. I forgot how much talking with you two brings so much joy to me. It has been almost 2 years since we were all in the office together. Thanks for coming in and making my day at the office a great one!\n\n188#Does this sound right?|I love that the first three people whom I got to know when I first started are the three who I go to when I want to check a thought or idea. Jay you were my buddy from the get go and have been that since. Jen and Alana you two were my first team and it feels weird if I see something funny and don’t instantly share it with you. Grateful to work with all of you and to call you friends! Hugs! Eggs have nothing to do with this award...just liked the photo ;)\n\n189#Putting our puzzle pieces together|Jen, Z, Moe, and Lauren - Thank you for your participation these past couple weeks in our Brand Platform workshops. As we are in the preliminary planning stages, we are really learning so much from each other's perspectives and putting our puzzle pieces together to evolve this cohesive brand strategy. Thank you for the amazing teamwork and collaboration, I appreciate you all and I can't wait to start putting this in motion.\n\n190#“B” Green Light|Team, After months of planning, strategizing, and developing, we got the green light to advance the brand platform - shifting us from ‘b’ to ‘B’. Thank you for your leadership, collaboration cross-functionally, and for thinking about the 2025 brand vision and strategy.\n\n191#FY22 Employer Brand|Moving Forward! We came together across teams and geographies to build a sound employer and recruitment brand strategy that would unleash the power of storytelling, place the employer as the main voice, increase our recruitment power, and scale our incredible culture. We're on track with the go-ahead from Steve and Niamh following a successful meeting yesterday. Thank you for all caring, collaborating, and truly putting the human at the core of everything we do (and proposed).\n\n192#WHL Resilience|Team, planning an in-person event in our current global environment is very challenging. Today, you presented a solid plan to Eric with a clear action plan to move our WHL planning forward. Thank you for staying flexible and focused and for tackling uncertain times with productive mitigation plans and net new ways of working with scenario plans. You’re working outside of your comfort zone, building trust internally, and managing communication exceptionally well. Be confident we’ll find a solution and we’re on track to producing the best WHL ever.\n\n193#|A shoutout to this team who has been heads down on this new key initiative for talent brand and internal to build upon our brand affinity and recruiting efforts in 2022. David was only 5 weeks in, sharing the strategy just before the holidays, with a brilliant understanding about the business and culture and where we could be better. Jen by David’s side coming up with thoughtful ideas and quick wins. Lauren, Alana, Liu and Maureen, I truly appreciate your committment squeezing in time wherever we could to keep us charging ahead. Phase 1 is in great hands with Colleen at the helm for internal and Liu, Alana and Lauren about to get things kicked off with our agency for external. Thank you all for making this a priority amongst all the others you have. Can’t wait to see this all come together in the new year and for more plans to unfold for Phase 2.\n\n194#Reimagination Engineers|The world is unprecedented and this team was challenged to reimagine options for Workhuman Live to ensure that we are able to deliver the experience, content and feelings of our flagship event to meet the needs of the unknown.  Over the course of two days, this group dropped everything to strategize the best options to move ahead.  I think the team came up with truly thoughtful ideas.  No matter how it takes shape, I'm confident our event bring down the house.  So proud to work with this group of humans.\n\n195#Better together|This team continues to amaze me. No matter what the challenge or the timeframe, you are all there, every damn time, bringing your absolute best. In the past 2 days we have had 4 meeting to help solve some recent challenges and you all showed up with your best ideas, creativity, snarky senses of humor, challenging one another, and identifying pitfalls - all with the utmost respect for the business and one another. You exemplify the culture we strive to create.\n\n196#Thank you 🙏🏻|Today I sit, truly humbled and grateful for this group of creative minds. We are a cross-section of so many different parts of the business – joined together by a mutual love and respect of design, problem-solving, and innovation. Each and every one of you gave up a huge chunk of your week to connect about our brand look and feel. We walked each other through challenges. We shared feedback, ideas, insights, goals. We learned a lot about the unique challenges each team faces, and how our visuals could better support. But most of all – dare I say, we had some fun? Our workshops/challenges were intense, and forced us each out of our comfort zones.... but woah: such excellent creative ideas in such short time!   Thank you all for kicking the year off with such a great show of support, passion, innovation and collaboration.  Bring it on 2022.\n\n197#An amazing experience in the making|Jen, I cannot thank you enough for your insane amount of support and guidance you have given to me already! Every time I hear you talk I get goosebumps about how awesome this WHL is going to be for the partners. Your thoughts and helpful tips on how to think and leverage difference aspects of this experience is going to make this event very special and an amazing way to kick off the partnership program. Thank you for all that you, I appreciate you so much!!\n\n198#Best sweater in one (or more) categories!|Abby, Jen P, Holly, Angela, Chris L and Lauren B - Thank you for bringing your \"A\" (or is it \"U\" as in ugly sweater) game to our town hall meets holiday \"fashion(?)\" mash up today. You each provided shining examples across a number of prestigious categories as voted on by a panel of your peers - categories including: Best overall, Best single dinosaur, Best multiple dinosaur, Most electrified, Most able to considered a regular sweater, and Best tattoo'd Santa sweater. Thank you for helping bring some good cheer and humor to today's event. With gratitude, - Richard and Chris\n\n199#There is a Superhero in all of us|Blown away again by his team's commitment to dropping everything to come together and use their collective talents to drive the business. Here's to all of you in celebration of teamwork!  When it matters most, we step up, rally the troops, and march right into the battle headfirst. Yesterday was another great example of what happens when you bring great minds together, the sparks fly, the ideas flow and suddenly we have a solution. There is a Superhero in all of us, we just have to put on the cape. Cheers to the team!\n\n200#Cyber-Success|Congratulations to this team on a successful Cyber-week promotional campaign for Workhuman Live.  The team went above and beyond the expected with multiple meetings, rework of creative mid-stream, late night and weekend work – with a focus on driving results.  Promotions like this are important to our success, and are a clear example of how teamwork and collaboration creates results.  Your efforts helped drive over 100 new registrations in just one week, helping accelerate our audience growth.  Well done by all!\n\n201#Brainstorm workshop … or Mind Typhon?|Team, amazing work coming together this week to collaborate on Workhuman Live.  We are at the point in the journey where its time to pivot.  You all took the time to join together in the office (some of you for the fist time since March 2020) and review messaging, branding, promotion, and website.  Every one of you readily adopted the ground rules for the day by leaving all egos at home, keeping an open mind, having some radical candor, and being purposefully critical.  We have a huge list of takeaways that are now in the process of being summarized and prioritized so it’s all actionable to drive Workhuman Live forward toward our goals.  I am proud to work and partner with you all.  Amazing work.\n\n202#Thank you for the warm welcome :)|Hey team,   I'd like to cap off my 2nd week at Workhuman by thanking you for being great teammates. You've welcomed me into your processes, patiently answered my questions, and earnestly listened to my opinions. I never thought I could be so comfortable while also drinking from a firehose!  I'm grateful to be working with such a bright, friendly, and hard working group, and I look forward to gaining your trust and delivering epic event experiences together.\n\n203#Most energizing meeting I've had in 9 years!|Yesterday I met with Jen, Jill, Alice, Meghan and Brian to discuss the WH Certified experience at Work Human Live. And I'm not kidding when I say it was the most energizing, productive and fun meeting I've had in years!  Coming from a research & advisory firm with a very corporate, process-driven culture, let's just say that most internal meetings were heavy on the seriousness and light on the levity. I continue to be inspired and validated in my decision to join Workhuman just 6 weeks ago, and yesterday’s meeting with you all was a highlight thus far. Excited to collaborate to bring WHC to life in Atlanta!\n\n204#Events is sometimes like|a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Popcorn, toast, and jellybeans. Who needs turkey?! You contribute seemingly simple yet magnificent resourcefulness and problem solving capabilities to the team. And of course what really matters is the people. Thank you to the humans who plan, build, review, deploy, monitor, and report on all the work. I am grateful to be able to work with you. Cheers!\n\n205#Scenario Planning Sesh #1 was what I'd call a Win|My head is spinning from all the inspired thinking in today's planning meeting. Thank you for sharing your Plans on a Page <or is it 'Plan on a Pages?!'> with the broader team. Thank you for deep diving into some of our Marketing priorities to identify integration points, gaps, opportunities for testing, and more. It was awesome to see different people gather to collaborate cross-functionally and spend time thinking about the \"what if sh....scenarios.\" And lastly, thank you for being good sports about the ice breakers questions. From Buzz Lightyear to time machine travel, childhood crushes  and early retirement dreams, I learned a lot of new things about each of you today!  And yet, I am sure you all agree that it felt like we barely scratched the surface in our three hours today. Not to worry! This is the starting point and I have a good feeling that this was just the first of many Scenario Planning sessions to come. So strap in and look forward to next steps AND the next invite. I am excited to work together to ensure we are set up to deliver business results, feel proud of our work, and have some fun along the way.\n\n206#Taking a page right out of the Teamwork Playbook|...as in \"Marketing Plan on a Page\" page! Thank you, Jess for jumping right in to design the template for our Marketing Plan on a Page and thank you Jen and Jill for helping me test it for usability!  Things are coming together! Let's GOOOO!\n\n207#Office Pure Imagination!|WOW!  I was completely blown away by the reimagined office experience presentation today, seeing the vision for all there is to come to make our spaces healthier, more innovative, work harder when together and remote, and deliver an incredible human experience. From beautiful and intentional design elements and upgrades, to beverage stations, to wellness, collaborative technologies and even a few surprises up your sleeves – you really have left no stone unturned!  This has been a massive undertaking to merge the working models of how all of our employees will return to the office, with the many moving parts of this pandemic, while also keeping a watchful eye on the transformation evolving RIGHT NOW in the world of workplace design & planning.  You are all blazing the trail for what the future of work will be, and how it manifests in both design and experience – well done to you all.  I cannot wait until it’s ready, (no pressure!) and want to thank you for breaking through with such exciting work.  We will all greatly benefit!\n\n208#Planning for Purpose!|Team,  What an incredibly informative, purposeful, and quality team-building day! Thank you for being present and prepared, for sharing your FY22 department vision and goals, and for collaborating on a unified FY22 brand marketing plan and most importantly our guiding purpose as a leadership team. I feel energized, optimistic, united and supported, and look forward to taking on the challenges that FY22 will bring.\n\n209#What an amazing team!|A huge shout out to Jill, Jen, Mark, Jeff & Melissa who made this week’s Atlanta site visit with Sparks a true experience! While this may have felt like “old hat” for many of you, this was a first for me and I was blown away by the level of expertise, thoughtfulness, partnership, collaboration, comradery and energy that every human brought into the process. It made the trip so unique, successful, and of course fun! Each of you brought a lens and level of detail that was critical to the mission. And on top of everything else, you made me feel like part of the team, no matter what my question, observation, or idea was. THANK YOU!!! I can’t wait to continue to play my small role in the evolution of WHL 2022. Please know how much I appreciate each of your contributions. YOU all are what make this event so phenomenal!\n\n210#The goal is progress, not perfection!|“First steps are always the hardest but until they are taken the notion of progress remains just a notion and not an achievement” — Through a time of transition, new planning processes and forecasts, and current executional needs this team has been exceptional. You’ve come together, forced needed changes, asked the right questions, and most importantly you’ve done it as a team. Thank you for leading by example, overcoming the daily challenges, and for accepting new perspectives and approaches.   You are building our game plans now so we can all enter the stadium with confidence together next year.   Remember, The goal is progress, not perfection\n\n211#Safe space for DE&I Conversations|When a potentially offensive image for an upcoming training module was flagged, I was grateful I could come to the DEI subcommittee to have an open discussion about what is considered appropriation. We were able to have a level-headed, fact-based conversation about the image, where we learned from each other's knowledge, experience, and perspectives. It was a personal growth moment for me as it was a form of cultural appropriation I was not aware of. Thank you for allowing me the space to be honest about what I didn't know, and learn from each of you.\n\n212#Thank you for the thank you|My request started with: I wanted to use a slide I know I’ve seen which is a mosaic of WH employees that either spells out Workhuman or something similar to that framework.  Does that ring a bell?  Luckily, Jen, knew what was going on in my fragmented mind, Jess, was able to track down the video (not slide, not even really a mosaic that spelled WH, LOL), and Amanda you were able to put it together into an actual slide I could use.  In the end, our Thank You to Fidelity hit the mark with one attendee giving us the heart emjoi. These are the small moments that matter that allows us to shine.  THANK YOU!\n\n213#The A Team|A huge shout out to this team for consistently being the foundation to the cross-functional group that produces the company's most coveted event (and then some). Whether it's putting in the work upfront with the overarching strategy or the oh-so-many details to follow, it's truly remarkable that less than 10 people keep it all afloat and moving downstream. It's been an honor to be in the trenches with you and I thank you for always supporting and teaching me along the way. I can't wait to see all that you'll accomplish next year but this is an appreciation post for all that you've done and overcome thus far. Sincerely, your biggest cheerleader.\n\n214#Creating the winning narrative for GE!|What a team effort to pull together an impactful deck/story for Eric to deliver at the GE leadership meeting! Jen, wow can you create an engaging story and quickly I might add! We learned very last minute that the format of the meeting with GE had changed to a keynote and you jumped right in and delivered an exceptional storyline. Very special thanks to Richard & Eileen for your strategic direction in making this succinct and relevant to GE's audience. Traci, you have been so incredible throughout the execution of this opportunity. You've attended every meeting with me to plan this and your ideas helped to shape the vision for this meeting, right from the start. And although you were enjoying your time off while the change in format surfaced, you jumped right in with a helping hand, providing exceptional finishing touches to this effort. Rebecca, you are the constant in all of this, we've been working together to pull together our follow up and you were so helpful in securing an execution plan to get these leaders to WH Live, Atlanta and to keep the conversation going!  This incredible effort will lead to big changes at GE, for the better! Thank you!!\n\n215#GE HRLT Summit Presentation|Thank you all so much for all your work on my presentation to the GE HR leadership team meeting. The stakes were high - they are a top customer, we've worked with them for 15 years, they know HR and are a very experienced team. They've been there and seen it all! It didn't help that a loose Q&A turned into a half hour presentation - with not much notice. But you guys rallied and the slides were perfect and we were able to meet their very defined messaging needs !! It went great because of you. Thank you!\n\n216#Because without the human, it's just work!|Team, we did it! Three net new commercials approved.   From bringing innovative concepts to the table, diligently managing internal/external processes and people, selecting cast members and custom audio, to evolving our product look & feel, addressing key stakeholder feedback, and more - we did it with respect for urgency, respect of customers, respect for innovation, respect for quality, and respect for all!    Thank you all for your selfless sharing of your expertise and active involvement in every phase of the commercial project. Your contributions have helped us achieve a high-quality project that addresses the zeitgeist and demonstrates the ROI of our products, and how we solve the most pressing issues facing the CHRO.  I’m so proud of this team and what we’ve achieved.     Let’s get them into the market!\n\n217#And thats a wrap!|Thank you for bringing your brilliance, remarkable talents, expertise, creativity, innovative thinking, and skills to drive the successful execution of the Spotlight broadcast and WHLive registration launch.  The work for these projects starts months in advance and continues for weeks after we go live. Over the last several months, there were endless moments of comradery, collaboration, and a continuous drive to raise the bar.    The road was challenging, but despite the obstacles, YOU DID IT!  You delivered a fabulous production and flawless launch.   Your passion is contagious. Congratulations and celebrate the moment!!\n\n218#Spotlight Messaging was Spot On|Wow!   Unlike the past two digital events, I did not know what was going to unveil.  So I got a chance to sit back and watch like other participants.  And I was blown away.  Best messaging I have seen, and was crisp, clear, meaningful, and it felt like your fingerprints were all over it.  Brilliantly done by the team!  John\n\n219#Workhuman Live is LIVE|Team, we’ve done it again!  After months of planning and hard work, we’ve launched Workhuman Live back in the market, back to LIVE.  Running parallel to Spotlight was no small feat, yet this team was up to the task.  Every one of you has contributed in so many ways.  From initial messaging and look books, to web designs and creative assets, writing of all the words, and getting the legal-ese just right – Live slowly came together for the market.  Emails, media, social, and enablement are all launched, and registration is doing its thing to capture and confirm our early adopters.  We’re just at the start (yes – 221 days to go) – but I am so proud to work with this team committed to excellence and success every single day.  Well done all!\n\n220#Spending too much time together!!|Jen, this is from Microsoft 365's analytics email they send out after analyzing your email and calendar. This surprised me, but then didn't! We have worked on so many important projects over the last month, from the new commercials, to Workhuman Spotlight, company updates - its a lot of editing and wordsmithing! I'm delighted to spend that time working with you. Thank you! But we'll have to stop meeting like this!\n\n221#R2 - 2 days early!|Team - thank you for delivering a great final Spotlight show two days ahead of schedule this Friday! It looks great and allows the tech teams more time to test and perfect the broadcast! With gratitude, -C\n\n222#R1-derful|Team - I appreciate your great teamwork and speed to deliver the \"R1\" cut of the Spotlight broadcast ahead of the scheduled weekend delivery last week. You accelerated well, and were proactive in communicating a new, earlier deadline for video delivery and review. Thank you for helping give time back, and creating more capacity for the final stages of testing. I appreciate that. Please share this with the Sparks team as well as they played an important role but are outside of our Spark recognition platform. With gratitude, -C\n\n223#So. Many. Moving. Parts|I needed to take a moment to recognize the amazing Tiger Team for all the hard work that you've put in these past couple weeks. You haven't stopped - from managing stakeholders feedback, the continuous working sessions, the endless collaboration internally and with our agency partner, and the quick turnarounds and pivots on product assets and VO scripts to make each iteration better. I'm so lucky to be part of this team and understand the level of effort that has been put into these commercials to achieve our media plan. Thank you for all your hard work, we're almost there!\n\n224#Spotlight Experts|We took the Product Segments work in house. And what wouldn't we? You are the experts in our Products, our Brand, our Voice, our Message, our Data, our Stories. Thank you for adding this important work to your plate; finding time, making time, juggling, and giving it your best. Cheers!\n\n225#One step closer to our next big push|Team, thank you for all of the hard work you did to put together a really great working session today about our upcoming commercial ad videos.   Your love of our brand and all we do continues to shine through in your collaboration, your flexibility, your keen insights, and never-ending thirst for creativity and excellence.  Because of your hard work, we were able to get the insights and feedback we needed.   THANK YOU!!!\n\n226#What shines brighter than a Workhuman Spotlight?..|... You do! Jen and Mark, thank you for partnering on a crisp and clear Spotlight strategy overview today at Progress Meeting. You helped represent on behalf of many teams that have been building and shaping these plans for the past 4+ months. I'm excited about the road ahead and look forward to a great show on Oct 6th. With gratitude, -C\n\n227#Presenting ... Workhuman Spotlight|Team - Thank you for your important contributions to our upcoming Progress Meeting discussion on Workhuman Spotlight. Your teamwork in creating a crisp and succinct overview of strategy, run of show, promotions, and tech plans is appreciated. I'm excited about the plan we have to share, and look forward to co-presenting with Mark and Jen next week. With gratitude, -C\n\n228#H2 Ads... you aint' seen nothing yet!|Team,  With incredible resilience, agility, compassion, and humility, you have taken in learnings from H1, sought out and acted upon critical feedback, and have masterfully managed the relationship with our new agency to create an end product that demonstrates what high quality commercial ads should look like. I am so proud of the work you are doing and am super excited to see what's next.  Well done!  Let's go go go.\n\n229#Just Brilliant!|Jen, this week you’ve been brilliant! Your incredible leadership, insight, drive, and sharpness have made a tangible impact on key initiatives moving forward to the next phase. From driving and presenting our story arcs in the H2 Commercials to key executive stakeholders to leading major deliverables connected to the Workhuman October Spotlight. Thank you for making a positive difference in everything you are part of.\n\n230#Don’t Look Back. We’re not going that way!|Team, it’s been a very short 8 weeks from the concepting to post-production phases! Today was another critical milestone in our journey - we presented the very first versions of the H2 commercials to key stakeholders and gathered sound feedback that will allow us to move forward.  How this team has come together, collaborated on action items in record time (aka 48hrs), and listened to various opinions/perspectives has been so beautiful to watch and be part of. If we keep delivering this level of team transparency, energy and focus on great work, we’ll be proud of what we put into the market! GREAT WORK, TEAM!\n\n231#Ted Lasso Ain't Got Nothin' on You Two|Richard and Jen, I just want to call out the amazing leadership the two of you have brought to our tiny but mighty team. Richard, you came in like a breath of fresh air with a really strong gust behind it. Your impressive breadth of experience means that every day I learn something new from you - from brand measurement to media buys, overarching strategies to commercials - you've done it all and you share that knowledge freely. You're a coach as much as you're a manager (and a damn good one). Above all this, you're incredibly insightful, measured, empathetic, egoless, humorous, kind, and an exceptional listener - all the qualities that inspire unwavering loyalty greatness in others. And Jen, you brought me into this company four years ago on your intuition, which is, in a word, unmatched. This mix of guts, grit, and feeling you bring to everything you touch is proving itself more invaluable every day in this next chapter of the Workhuman story. You're just the bee's knees when it comes to how we say what we say because you live and breathe this brand like no one else. In case you can't tell, I'm so so grateful to be on this team with two of the best humans out there.\n\n232#The secret magic sauce behind the scenes|Jen, John, Christina, Cullen, and Thomasina,  Thank you for creating the foundation for the magic to happen!  Our next series of rich stories and high value production commercial videos are going to be instrumental in our continued path of breaking through the noise - and letting the world know that it is time to work human.  From optimizing new and existing agency relationships to creative genius, you have kept this engine going at full capacity without missing a beat and with such grace and commitment to excellence.  THANK YOU for all you do!\n\n233#You can make anything by writing - C.S. Lewis|Jen and Owen, in the midst of so many deliverables, you came together to create a wonderful script to tell the Spotlight broadcast viewers all about the Certified pilot.  The unique value and urgent need for the Certified program shines through in every word you put on paper. Thank you for all you do!\n\n234#The Final Countdown|The Band was Europe and the song was “It’s the Final Countdown.”  Here’s to the Band that pulled the Spotlight broadcast launch together. Following months of preparations, the official launch hit the streets on Wednesday and the registrations are rolling in. Congratulations to all of you for the effort, creativity, and teamwork.  T-48 and counting!\n\n235#Setting the tone for what comes next!|WH Live has always had a unique vibe, sense of wonder, and community that is contagious and inspiring. Underneath it all, there are countless people and talent that help bring it to life in so many ways. In the beginning, it’s things like a Look book that set the tone for what comes next and how we will build momentum along the way. This is a super shoutout to the team that pulled it together -from researching the city, incorporating its vibe, designing the graphical elements, and tying it all together to create a cohesive look and feel. Congratulations on a job well done!\n\n236#Brand Camp all stars|Since late April when we first launched the refreshed look, and the new brand book, you all have consistently been a part of our weekly Brand Camp sessions. Whether reviewing each others work and giving/receiving creative feedback from your peers; Participating in interesting design exploration with new ways of looking at brand elements; looking at work that other brands are putting out there to increase your awareness of trends and styles; or to just kick back with a coffee and let the creative banter fly.... you've been there. The meeting is only an hour a week, but every single moment has been valuable, even when we're just making each other laugh. Why? Because this is us. Our big, beautiful network of creative thinkers and makers. Each with unique ideas and perspectives, every single one as worthy as the next. The support, learning and insights you've all given and received are awesome, and you've done this at a time where staying connected to folks you don't work with directly is *really hard* to do. So, thank you for being here for each other, its really inspiring :)\n\n237#Rising Up.. Did our Time…Took Our Chances|Tiger Team, I’m continuously amazed by your performance week in and week out. The last 3 weeks working on up-leveling the H2 commercial strategy, storyboards, and scripts while onboarding a production house has been a doozy. Thank you all for your commitment to excellence and quality, your focus on driving our brand story to the next level, and for always placing our customer at the core of the experience. As a team, you’ve innovated, inspired, worked weird long hours, accepted different perspectives, fielded and actioned feedback, and managed communications to keep everything on track for phase 1 approval. Keeping this shared team mindset, the drive for only great advertising, and the ability to critically grade our own homework will make the transition from storyboards to production a beautiful thing to be part of. I'm ready for pre-production challenges, are you?\n\n238#Calling all Speakers – It’s Live!|Thank you all for your contribution to the Call for Speakers webpage. We’ve evolved this from a way to collect submissions for our annual event to support all of our engagements that have the opportunity to include external voices – live events, digital broadcasts, webinars, the LinkedIn Live series, and more. It’ll also now lives on the corporate website year-round opposed to an event site for only 3-months. We get thousands of submissions each year and now those applicants can easily click over to learn more about our products and customers on Workhuman.com. This was a labor of love that included project management, web design, form and email creation, web updates, and additional brainstorming amongst others. I appreciate this cross-functional team of experts.\n\n239#The Dynamic Duo|Jen & Owen, assigning a value to this award was a challenge because it's respect for teamwork, quality, and urgency. Thank you for helping to create thoughtful interview questions for a Workhuman Spotlight segment. When we got word the speaker had to record within a week, we got to work on the words themselves. With jam packed schedules and a laundry list of to-dos, we were still able to have a first draft within 24-hours. I appreciate the time and attention you gave to this task.\n\n240#What are you into?|Last night I went and met up with some friends, who had other friends I didn’t know. Enter the imma talk to this person move. As I started to talk, your voice came into my head. “Ask people what they are into, not what they do.” So I did so. Literally got a high five from the person I was talking to. He said, “I love that, it makes it so that people are not pigeon holed into what they do.” Thanks for being a great influence on helping people connect better. Also, I miss you.\n\n241#Workhuman Spotlight!!|Amazing work by this entire team for getting all the things done this week to keep us on track for the October Broadcast!  We have a name, a look book , a kick-butt abstract, a platform decision, and speaker contracts in the works.  We needed to work together to keep things on track and everyone on this team stepped up to get it done and approved.  Thanks for making this a priority and enabling us to go forth into the next phase of planning and promotions!\n\n242#Working Human Champions Unite!|I wanted to express my gratitude to this fine team of colleagues who have come together to share ideas, express concerns and TAKE ACTION to help shape the human experience and culture for our Marketing team. Your commitment goes way back to last fall when we formed the original Pulse Survey Groups but we reinvented ourselves about a month ago and decided there is strength in numbers. When you share a common goal and vision, it might make sense to join forces. And, wow...were we spot on. I love the collaboration and get giddy when hearing and seeing the larger group feed off each other's ideas. This group championed the DiSC workshop as our first official all hands L&D opportunity. This group helped reimagine the town hall as a platform to showcase the strong work and diverse voices across all of Marketing. This group is thinking ahead to what the next phase of work, when we step away from our Zoom calls and return to the office in some form or fashion, means for our newest marketers and everyone else that survived the last year+! This group is thoughtfully pulling together strategies to help foster the human connections that will inevitably make our team stronger and our work even better. It's a side hustle when we are all hustled out most days, but it matters and I genuinely appreciate your investment. We've only scratched the surface, but after receiving positive feedback on yesterday's town hall and coming off of a lively planning call with many of you earlier today regarding our next couple of initiatives, I am feeling optimistic about the journey we've chosen to take together. #btpftp THANK YOU for your commitment to me, to each other, to all of Marketing, and to working human!\n\n243#Who you calling a kitty cat?|Video Ad Tiger Team - thank you for all of your preparation, ideation, and a whole lot of laughs as we prepped for the next phase of ads for our amazing, beloved brand.  Because of your tiger team mindset, you took every barrier and turned it into a strategy to something great. You treated every smoother path as an opportunity to accelerate toward outcomes.  The end result of your collective roar:   Amazing purr-worthy options to share our story, our brand, and our solutions and lots of collaboration.  Onward!\n\n244#Thank you for your partnership!|Thank you all for a successful first meeting of the digital advisory committee! All of you shared personal insight and perspective that was extremely valuable in setting the stage for our executive council session. We are extremely excited about how the conversation will continue to grow and evolve moving forward and your voice will be a vital component to shape and maximize our web impact! Thank you all!\n\n245#Great working session!|Team - Thank you for a great working session yesterday. It is exciting to be architecting the next chapter in Workhuman's growth story. I also appreciate how the essentiality of human connection and the relevance of pioneering a more human workplace quickly unites new joiners and tenured Workhuman employees. We saw this firsthand throughout our session in the collective enthusiasm and passion for what we do and the value we create we all displayed. It demonstrates the power and impact of our mission and our solutions. With gratitude, -C\n\n246#Re-Igniting at Spark Summer|Eric, Thank you for taking the stage for our Spark Summer event and inspiring everyone through your keynote! There is no secret sauce, only great humans, and I am so grateful for the stories you shared that brought our mission, culture, impact and opportunity to life. And Jen, thank you so much for bringing your keynote brilliance to Spark Summer. Was this a record in how quickly (and beautifully) it came together? But seriously, there was so much goodness to share, incredible human stories, and I'm so grateful for you both! Thank you.\n\n247#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n248#Keys to the Keynote|Hey Gang, This year, most of Workhuman Live Online production was tackled by out of house vendors with the exception of Eric's keynote address. Jen, without your artistic brain, and you working directly with Eric and getting the raw direction and feedback, we could never have pulled this off in the short amount of time we had. Jill, not even sure what to say as you are vital and critical to all parts of all things WHLO. None of it happens without you and your hard work and strategic planning. Carrie, you came through in the clutch with assistance on graphics and design as the hyper organized human file cabinet of goodness we all love you for being. Nuvs, you recorded some video of the inclusion advisor to give that section of the keynote a little extra pizazz and you did it, and re-did it in a tight pinch. Jay, you adapted and evolved some production graphics including a fun show opener in the midst of website mayhem. Thank you for making the time. Owen, writing Eric's script and content pretty much consumed your life out of left field for the better part of a whole work week. I know it was very hard on you so thank you weathering the storm and delivering great work in the face of the challenge. Cullen, your first big project for the company and you sa-moked it. You rolled with the inevitable left and right field feedback on anything this large. You brought your original artistic style to the edit and we hit the all the deadlines we said we would. D and Stewy, you were both pivotal in the conversation segment with Ro. Without your hard thoughtful and timely work, there is no chance that section would look as polished and up to date as it does. It was a joy to work with you and I am making the case for more creatived to engage your team on our work. To anyone reading, THIS is is what it sometimes take to make \"a video\". No one can do it alone, so thank you all.\n\n249#WHLO Retro|Thank you for completing the WHLO survey within the allotted timeframe. Your feedback is important to help drive improvements in how we work on future events. I appreciate your time and input. Your voice has been heard. Cheers!\n\n250#Workhuman Live Warriors|HI ALL! I wanted to say thank you for all that you have done to help us bring the event to life on social. From my constant pings of needing something to talking out ideas of design concepts, you all have played a part in helping us launch a successful campaign. Throughout the last 2-3 weeks, I have asked for event details, creative feedback, headshots, obtain video clips, and more. And everyone was so gracious in helping me and our team get anything we need to execute our plans and share the event story. Thank you so much!\n\n251#Never say Last|Team - this recognition is for your efforts on the 'Last Chance' campaign to entice people to join Workhuman Live Online. The work came at the end of many weeks of exerted effort and non-stop promotions across all possible channels. Thank you for giving this last reminder communication as much attention as the first one from months ago. I applaud your dedication. Cheers!\n\n252#Passion!|Jen and Lauren, I couldn't be more excited to be a partner on the next evolution of the Workhuman brand. Thank you both for the warm welcome and incredible advice over the past two weeks as I've navigated my new WH environment.   Jen, in just two short weeks I've seen your amazing ideation capabilities, strategic prowess in navigating the c-suite and cross-functional teams. Lauren, your exceptional ability to take what's in our minds and articulate it in writing has been amazing to watch (and read).   You're both so talented and I can't wait to see what we can achieve together. Thank you for the warm welcome (it's starting to feel a little like home already)\n\n253#Badge of Honor|Team, this month marks a time in our company's history: a linear TV/CTV and omni-channel brand campaign.  Bringing our company's first commercial to market has been quite the adventure.  Despite years of experience between us, none of us had ever brought an ad to market during a pandemic. We learned so much together. It has been joyful, difficult, fun, frustrating, and one of the best examples of resilience, trust, compassion, and teamwork I have seen,  At each and every step, you remained positive, committed, and determined to create something beautiful.  Thank you for all of your hard work.  Excited to see what comes next. I am so proud of you!\n\n254#Bring Us Home!|Jen - Where to begin! From the minute you joined us on the commercial project I was instantly grateful to have you there. Your calm, focused direction is exactly what’s needed. Your passion and understanding of Workhuman shines through in every conversation. Just hearing your thought process is inspiring. Bring us home my friend!!\n\n255#Fastest keynote|Team, We just launched the second keynote speaker for Workhuman Live Online. You did it in record time. From negotiating contracts, making quick decisions, developing copy and creative, speedy approvals, building, trafficking, launching, coordinating schedules. We even recorded Common's session before we promoted him. That's a first! Common and Zain were prepped for a relevant conversation to close the event and drive home our messaging. Then on to editing. Oh my, so much editing to filter out the best of all the words. It takes a dedicated team of individuals with unique skills to include a keynote in an event. Thank you for your commitment to Workhuman Live. I recognize all the work you do behind the scenes to make it seem... common.\n\n256#Thank you for the open conversation|I want to thank this team for the open conversation we just had about Spark Summer and concerns from employees, which were shared with the DEI ERG leaders. The ability to discuss, learn, share and evolve is so much appreciated, and the whole way it all took place was so full of respect and consideration for all. Just the absolute living example of our Respect for All value and I'm so grateful for each of you.\n\n257#It takes a village|Team - creating a corporate overview deck that elevates and integrates the brand, business, and solution story is always a long process of trial and error.  You each have put in so much of your blood, sweat, tears, joy, laughter - and best of all - humanity into this project.  Thank you for never giving up and for always coming back to the table with renewed energy and resilience.  So proud to work with you!\n\n258#Transitions are hard...|...but with you on my corner, I feel I can navigate them much more confidently. Jen, thank you for initiating and meeting with me to talk Conversations, logistics, the people-manager role and anything else I wanted to talk about that would help me in my new role. You're so thoughtful with your ideas and generous with your time, and always thinking of ways to make things better not as a one-time event but for others to benefit down the line. I appreciate you so so much! Thank you!!\n\n259#Tactful Conversations around Appropriation|It's hard express just how grateful I am for our conversations around DEI and cultural appropriation recently. Elise, you've been so supportive and thoughtful while bringing this to light. I admire your courage for calling out something has the potential to make others feel dishonored. Erica, Jen, and Nuvs, thank you for fostering a culture where we speak freely about our concerns. Each of you provided excellent pathways for who to talk to and what we can do next. Erica, I especially appreciate the way you're keeping us in the loop about how conversations around appropriation are forming. It's so validating to see people have that lightbulb moment of \"oh! I didn't realize this could be harmful. I'm so glad you brought it up.\" Thank you for prioritizing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I'm so proud to have you all as coworkers, mentors, and friends.\n\n260#Attendee Portal Experience|Thank you, team, for the hard work on our WHLO attendee portal build.  Working in a totally new registration platform, there were a lot of learnings we had to get through to make this a reality.  You all collectively came together to focus on the brand experience, security, UX, and business outcome alignment.  Lots of meetings, lots of testing, and lots of scenario discussions later – the platform is up and running and functioning as expected so the thousands of registrants can now build out their custom agendas and prepare for Live, just two weeks away!  Great work all around!\n\n261#Session Reg is Open!|Team, way to deliver on getting our WHLO session registration comms out the door to continue driving our audience engagement and registrations.  This was one very complicated promotional week, as we segmented the audiences much deeper than before to incorporate custom recommended sessions for each group.  Between the two events, this resulted in 32 different versions of emails written, designed, customized, built, tagged, and deployed – ensuring it all was aligned to the right business goals for customers and prospects alike.  Along with it, you rolled out media across every channel globally to spread the word and create excitement.  Registration has jumped by over 1200 since this started launching on Monday!  Awesome work by the whole team.\n\n262#Speakers and More Speakers|Almost feels like an in-person event to have this many speakers! Landing so many speakers is a huge achievement in a compressed digital event timeframe. Kudos. A second speaker announcement was not in the plan. But how could we not shout out about more great names and companies? Game. Changers. Even with an extra twist to get a couple of external approvals you launched the assets without delay. Thank you for rolling with the changes and still bringing your best to the work. It is your determination and dedication that is driving registrations. Cheers to you all!\n\n263#What's Going On|Thank you to this team of people leaders for leading a conversation around allyship today. Following this discussion, I heard from a few attendees how meaningful it is to be a part of a workplace where we can speak openly and tackle these issues head on. I whole-heartedly agree. It is a true demonstration of our sense of community at Workhuman. Steve, thank you for the powerful introduction, and for sharing your lived experience. Michelle and Jen, thank you both for stepping up to help facilitate, for your preparation and suggestions leading up to the event, and for your openness and candor on the call. Kevin and Colleen, thank you for sharing ideas and providing support as we prepped. And Jon, thank you for jumping in at a moment’s notice to provide some context around Marvin Gaye and his powerful song, “What’s Going On.” I’m grateful to be at a place where everyone’s voice matters and we can support one another in this way. There is hope.\n\n264#Same day help|Last week Amy needed a PPT to try to land a speaker for Workhuman Live. She put out the call. You answered with assets to leverage, suggestions on content, and a quick polish to get it out the door. Thanks, team!\n\n265#ERGs @ HXLT Day!|Thank you to all of you for joining this week's HXLT meeting to present your progress and plans for your respective ERG groups. It was a fantastic kick-off for these quarterly check-ins!  Your presentations were thoughtful, exciting, and passionate.  It was truly emblematic of the work you've done as leaders of your groups. You've brought forth such great innovation and ideas (and also crowdsourced them from the many amazing ERG members), which has helped educate our employees across a diverse set of topics. As we continue this journey, the future is so bright. Not only will many more Workhuman people feel a stronger sense of belonging but the perspectives that all ERGs bring will play a big part in the growth of Workhuman as a company.\n\n266#I spy … Cy!|Team – way to go getting all the facets of our Cy Wakeman Host announcement into the market this week.  Every new message in the journey brings with it new challenges, new deliverables, and constant iterations to get it just right.  Working through multiple agencies this time adds layers of reviews, approvals, and forces us all to be much more buttoned up to make it all happen.  From contract to launch, every one of you stepped up to do your part and more, helping deliver over 1200 new registrations since the announcement went into market.  Way to deliver!\n\n267#When a dream becomes a reality|Months ago, Jess and I shared a conversation, almost giddy with the dream of creating a brand book in honor of the brand we both love. It's been a whirlwind of blood, sweat, tears, and laughter ever since. I am so proud of the Brand Book you created together. It's not often to see something in your head come to life so beautifully and so quickly that it exceeded what you thought was possible. Your collective and individual commitment to excellence has shown through in spades! Happy Workhuman Brand  Day!  Congratulations on a true team effort!\n\n268#Stepping in and Stepping Up|As is often the case with Workhuman Live, we had to make a quick pivot this week.   We learned late in the promotion cycle that we'd have to delay our keynote announcement.  What to do?  No worries with this group!  Dianne, you rally the troops.  Lauren, you crank out the best words to convey a new message.  Alanna and Jen, you design beautiful images to present the words.  This team stepped up and allowed us to stay on track for next week.  Thank you for all you do!\n\n269#Beyond Grateful for the Brand Book|Today was a huge day for our company. It is with a grateful heart I thank you for the long, countless hours of research, design, word-smithing, and fit and finish over the past few months creating our refreshed Brand Book. For making this dream a reality. For all the zoom calls, the slack messages, the emails and even texts. For pouring your heart and soul into this project, the late nights, weekends, and exorbitant amount of work accumulating into the beautiful set of tools for our company to grow and scale with. This is just the beginning, setting us up for success and I couldn’t be more proud. Thank you.\n\n270#Because of you.|Jess, Lauren, Jen, Sam. The past few months of working with you all on the brand refresh (the ideation, the messaging, the structure of the book, the creative execution, the photo shoot, and all the pieces in between) have truly been the best few months of my Workhuman experience. Sam, you have been here for less than six months. And in that time, I’ve watched you jump into these projects midstream, push for clarity and best practices, advocate for creative resources, support everyone involved, drive the process and the progress with internal and external resources, and do it all with a friendly and professional approach. Without your expertise, this project could not have moved forward. Jenn, you are the yin to my yang. I love working with you on anything from creative ideations and storytelling to word-smithing and brainstorming. I am in such awe of how your brain can go into several different directions at once and tie things together in a way that other people just cannot see. Without you this project would not be as insightful and inclusive. Lauren, for years you have been helping us tell brand stories in all our campaigns and day-to-day materials. And for the past few months, you have helped us thread together the story of Workhuman on the whole, and your words have brought life to the brand book. Without you, this project would not have the same level of soul. And Jess – when we came together in the new year to divide and conquer, I never expected that it would be the most fun, creative, and exciting few months of my time here. You encouraged and enabled us, supported us, and advocated for us, and amplified our voices. You actively listened and offered actionable feedback. You gave us the space to thrive, and we did. Without you, this would have just been another project, but instead, you gave us the chance to bring our best selves to work, and have a lasting impact on the brand. Thank you all so very much.\n\n271#Live site is Live!|This team! Tremendous accomplishment today in launching WorkhumanLive.com including a new registration platform. We had multiple new vendors, which is a huge lift to get set up and on board. We had few days to build and test. You all worked together, bringing your individual expertise to the work and determination to meet an aggressive launch date. I saw many of you patting your head while rubbing your belly (so to speak). Your dedication and hard work paid off. Humans are registering. Every day counts. I am thankful for this team in getting to Day 1!\n\n272#It's Raining... Focus|We were given a deadline from a vendor on Friday morning. We received specs for the work late Friday. The deadline was the following Monday. I believe this is the shortest timeline I've seen in the past 5 years. Because we are working with a second vendor, there was a lot of concern (at least on my part!) in creating assets in less than 8 business hours. Thank you for supporting each other over the weekend, knowing this was a critical deadline, being responsive in reviewing WIP, sending pieces of information, participating in the review/progress meeting, and maintaining... Focus. I'm so impressed (and hope we never have to turn assets around that quickly again). Cheers to you, team!\n\n273#When the rubber meets the road - for an event|It takes a lot of tires. The event dates changed. Within minutes action was taken. Within hours - Vendors were contacted. Logos were created. Assets for marketing and sales enablement were updated and shared. Things were paused. Plans for additional work were developed. Within days - Web pages were updated, email was written, built, and launched, comms were shared, calendars were updated, campaigns were revisited and adjusted. It was a lot of effort by a lot of expert and dedicated humans. Thank you!\n\n274#Think quick!|Jen, I really appreciate you pushing the envelope to drive forward the Workhuman Live design approach and gain the teams buy-in so we can get it into our agency’s hands.  I know there has been a lot of voices involved in nailing it down to get it just right – and the final product is just perfect!  Your efforts are ensuring we can deliver the site design and assets on-time, and of course, on-brand!  I can’t wait to see it all come to life in the weeks ahead.\n\n275#Voila - the risk disappears|A Risk was identified. You were notified. You made it disappear. Thank you for working together on an abbreviated version of the Event Look Book that was needed before the final asset delivery date. Your collaboration and quick responses allowed the event website work to stay on track. Well done!\n\n276#Spark of my day|Jen - you asked for a DACI today. You made my day. It was already in progress, perfect timing. Thank you for adopting the language that will help our team be aligned and efficient. Cheers!\n\n277#Workhuman Listens|All,  It’s been such a pleasure to talk to you all over the past weeks, and to hear how much the voice of our customers matters to you! Over the coming months, we will help you create surveys to tap into the wealth of great things our users have to say about our products, how positive their experiences are… how they feel using the platform!! We have distilled the conversations we have had into a roadmap, which we will share with all of you next week. Over the past year, we, the EXM team, have seen some heartwarming testimonials from users, and I have no doubt that we are about to open the floodgates of thanks! I recall about a year ago, when we did our first proper ‘Periscope’ that the resounding response was a 72% ‘Just plain THANK YOU’  and the remaining 28% had some really encouraging and helpful feedback to offer, which we can use to make our product even better!!  All we need to do is listen!  I am excited to start working with you, and encouraged by your enthusiasm for the program.  Let’s build Workhuman listens!    Brian, EXM team\n\n278#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n279#Creative Skills on 10! for Certified|Carrie and Jen, I am so thankful for the work you did on Workhuman Certified final deck.  The final strategy document genuinely captures the essence and vision of Certified.  I am so grateful that in your SPARE time you took time to help me position, brainstorm and create visuals for the next level of Workhuman Certified.  True Talent and Insight!!! Team work and imagination.... great power punch!\n\n280#Getting the DEI Party Started!|You can tell by how hard I'm cheezin' in this screen shot how our first DEI employee resource group meeting made me feel. Thank you all so much for not only reaching out with your interest in helping get this group started, but also for sharing your passions, stories and ideas. I can already see we've started a community that is inspired to speak up, to educate ourselves and others, and to make sure we're working together to do this the right way. We all bring your own unique voices, experiences, and identities to our discussion and our soon-to-come actions  - I see you, I hear you, and I can't wait to continue learning from each of you!\n\n281#The best Sous Chefs ever|Jen and Moe, yesterday we had a real breakthrough moment, realizing the urgency to divide and conquer this amazing brand refresh in order to leverage our years of experience (and have a bit of fun too). After months in the planning stages, we've got all the ingredients in place to bake our Brand Recipe and now it's time to starting mixing them, carefully adding them one by one. If we miss something early on, it could all flop and leave a bad taste in our mouth. If we add too much of one thing, it looses the specialness in each bite. It's a delicate balancing act of taste and measurements, but it will be worth it in the end. We all play a crucial role in making this Brand rise and I couldn't ask for a better team by my side to make it happen.\n\n282#And the Oscar for Best Supporting Cast goes to...|Chris and I are (for the first time ever) speechless.  It’s true!  You each put in an incredible number of hours, going above and beyond, to create an Ignite Marketing Keynote experience like no other -  for our colleagues and for Chris and me.  From the voice-overs, to the lights-camera-action equipment and setup, to the script writing and visuals on the ppt, slack channel and emails…and so much more.  This includes you, HRI and IT colleagues!  We are so grateful to you and want to recognize and say thank you for all of the incredible support received by this cross-functional team effort. It's THAT KIND OF TEAM EFFORT that is needed to create an iconic brand.  There is no better team than you all.   Here’s to a great 2021!\n\n283#Keynote|Thank you so much Jen for all your help on my keynote presentation for Ignite 2021! It was a difficult, virtual, WFH new world and so it presented it's challenges. But your work on the presentation was amazing and the finished result was a pleasure to present. I'm only sorry I had to cut a few bits for time - they were some of the best bits! At least we have a start on the next one now! Thank you!\n\n284#Advanced Appreciation|Hi peeps. Mid January means Ignite is in high gear. A stressful time to add work onto your other marketing work. It's going to be great. Your time, energy, and resourcefulness to turn the event digital is much appreciated. Thank you. Finish strong!\n\n285#Putting in the work|Team - on behalf of Patti and myself, we wanted to say, \"Thank you\" and recognize the teamwork, collaboration, and effort you've collectively put in to moving our Pulse Survey action plans forward from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Together, we've made great quarter over quarter progress due to your efforts. This is an \"above and beyond\" initiative you've stepped up to lead. In doing so, you are each playing a leadership role for your marketing colleagues and peers - and - making a meaningful contribution to Patti, Tyler, and myself in building an amazing employee experience. This type of work is not the kind you can do \"every so often\" or \"sometimes\" and expect to achieve progress. It takes ongoing focus, a solutions-based outlook, courage and candor to build and sustain a great employee experience. Thank you for putting in the work - we look forward to continued advancements as we turn the page to 2021! With gratitude, -C\n\n286#Story Partners|Owen and Jen, this award is long overdue, but as I reflect on the year, one experience that stands out was a week span in late August trying to work out how we were going to shape all the story ingredients for the October show.  We had so many different pieces to work with and ways to shape them, and each day our working sessions were comprised of the typical \"Sh$9t what are we gonna do?\", aha moments, and forward progress.  This award represents putting the work in, putting it in front of yourself, and the fluidity required to getting things done.  As we worked through capturing the content in September, and finishing it in October - that humid summer week was one for the books. Without your respect for all the things, the following months would have looked very different. Thank you!\n\n287#Work Fam|Jen and Alana...you both rock so much. I love talking with you, hearing stories, learning more about each of you. You both are kind, generous, funny, creative, and well..just awesome people! I'm so grateful to know both of you and that I get to work alongside of you. This award is for quality because you are both top shelf (people say that right?).\n\n288#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n289#Hand in hand|Jenn there is so many ways this award could go. But this recognition moment is for all of the moments that have happened recently, where are you and I have had the opportunity to connect, collaborate, commiserate, and celebrate everything that we are working on or experiencing in life. I have the most wonderful brand partner in you, and I am so grateful for your ability to tell a story, and do it in a way that respects all of the points of view that need to be considered. Your work on the new deck, the brand refresh, and re-thinking what events mean to our company, as well as the advocacy you show in everything from workplace rights, to accessibility standards in our colors… does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. You bring tremendous value to everything that you touch, and this is a better company because you are here. ❤️\n\n290#Pioneers and Innovators for ABM 2021|Wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has contributed to the evolution and strategic approach for our sales priority accounts.    A lot of time, thought, and effort has gone into taking our messaging and strategy to the next level as we work with some of our top tier opportunities, including recently with Raytheon and SalesForce.  This new collaborative process will help drive engagement into some of our most sought-out accounts, with the potential to change the landscape for Workhuman!  Please pass this gratitude along to anyone not the list, or potentially outside of our org (thinking of our freelancers who have been called on to elevate their work to ensure best-in-class messaging)!  Cheers, all!\n\n291#The Workhuman brand experience|A brand is an alchemy of identity, emotion, experiences, charisma – the soul of the company and the products it makes. Remove any of these factors you’re left looking at only part of the picture. Unless you look at how people interact with a company and its products, you don’t have a holistic picture of the brand. The experience is cohesive and purposeful though brand identity, marketing communications, physical environments and product experiences. I'm so grateful to partner with you and your teams to create the total Workhuman brand experience. Bridging the gaps between product and brand and ultimately designing those cohesive experiences that create strong emotional connections in order to build trust, drive preference, and ultimately create affinity. Because of you, this has been one of the best collaborative initiatives I've had the pleasure of working on at Workhuman and can't wait to see it all come to life!\n\n292#Offer of support!|Jen - I just wanted to extend my gratitude to you for meeting with me last week, for your sage advice and then going above and beyond by putting yourself into the mix as someone for Jordane to reach out to with regards her development. I appreciate your openness and offer to support her and I with this.\n\n293#Hello, it's me.|I was wondering if... you ever get sick of my emails? Since 2014, when a group of us first started planning this thing... Workhuman, I've created folders and spreadsheets in an attempt to track all the details. Fast forward to 2020 and I realize that was a good idea but would be an attempt at achieving the impossible. I would need humans to help me remember it all. (And, btw... when i say \"ALL\" - I mean the things in my world. Ha!) Well,  those humans are the two of you! Thank you for answering every random email with questions dating back to the beginning of Workhuman time. The latest one will be used in a meeting with new members of LinkedIn's leadership team - including the CHRO! You are the best!!!\n\n294#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n295#Workhuman Certified Superstars|The words “thank you,” can’t begin to express the gratitude Brenda and I have for this team of talented colleagues who we’ve had the pleasure of working with to bring the Workplace Charter of Rights and Workhuman Certified to life. Whether you’ve been on this journey with us for the past year or the past month, you’ve all had a hand in helping us achieve our vision of changing the workplace for good. Our Marketing friends set the stage for success with a strong go-to-market strategy & brand design, an engaging web presence with compelling copy, customer pioneers to validate our program and tell their stories and customer “friendlies” to preview the program, influencer briefings, securing previous WH Live videos, and so much more! Our HR team challenged our new way of thinking about HR programs, helping to shape the Enterprise application process and ensuring we as a company were demonstrating progress in the Rights, while also preparing to educate and inform employees about this new initiative. And behind the scenes, our very own legal eagles were there to ensure everyone’s best interests were kept in mind. This is the largest cross-functional project we’ve been part of during our time at Workhuman, and we couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together. The saying is true…teamwork really does make the dream work! Thank you, all!\n\n296#One more thing|Jen - thank you for answering the call this AM to make a last minute slide for a presentation to executives. You knew just what to make and were on standby to finish it once the data was supplied. Thank you for understanding the important and urgency of this request.\n\n297#Meeting of Digital-First Minds|How do you go from physical and digital events in record time? You rely on talented, self-less leaders who, in addition to managing teams, also manage to roll up their sleeves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. From book and certified microsites to corporate site work and event promotion to the story, UX, design, infrastructure and development of the show itself, you all worked tirelessly through the tightest of deadlines. Your efforts will not only make WHLO a success, they will move us closer to being the iconic digital-first brand we aspire to be.\n\n298#Workhuman Live!|I felt like something was awfully wrong in the world this past weekend. I had NOTHING to do for the Workhuman Live broadcast this Thursday! So this is what it feels like to be ahead of the game and prepared a week early! Well done to you all for the preparation, planning, writing, filming, logistics, vendor management, technical excellence and execution of the creation of this fabulous event. The event looks amazing – and I include in that the subsequent web site creation and lead capture processes. It’s a slick and professional production, I’m sure it will be a huge hit. Awesome job, thank you all!\n\n299#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n300#A Tough Nut to Crack!|As we approach the final stretch of the Workhuman Certified Campaign I wanted to take a moment to thank you all for the creativity and resilience you've demonstrated in the past week, really digging into the design of the Certified website. This site is a gateway to the entire WH experience and Workplace Rights while acting as a centerpiece of the GTM campaign.With that this team was presented with some of the toughest UX \"nuts\" we've had to crack, and you all rose to the challenge. While there is still a long road ahead of us (and more than a few tough nuts along the way) I'm sure this team will help lead the charge with an amazing digital experience as we introduce Workhuman Certified to the world. Thank you!\n\n301#Versions 1, 2, and 3|Thanks to this team for being able to pivot quickly. I can imagine how difficult it is to get assets out the door with so many eyes on it for review and approvals. I appreciate everyone huddling together early this morning (thanks to Dianne for making it happen) to come up with a game plan. Plus with our talented designers every version just gets better and better!\n\n302#VIP Invite|Thank you for all your hard work on the Board of Directors invitation to Workhuman Live Online. An important piece of communication. The extra rounds and extra hours are appreciated.\n\n303#Looking both ways|We've got less days ahead of us than behind us on the journey to Workhuman Live Online. But there's no coasting downhill for this team. Some of the work is ramping up, some of it is continuing to speed along. You've all been putting forth your best efforts,  and many extra hours. The shared experiences build not only the event but also keeps the department strong. Cheers to you!\n\n"
"304#Building A Pathway To The Future|Team, thank you to each of you for letting me join your team meeting today. There is so much opportunity ahead. I left our discussion feeling excited by our agreed upon next steps as we build our pathway ahead.  Your ideas, your passion, and your desire to build for a better way of working together exemplifies respect for team and what it means to truly Workhuman.\n\n305#Tri-Force|Each time we huddle about content, questions, meeting prep, production approaches I feel like the image of Link hefting the tri-force (because its the 3 of us) is a fitting representation of the outcome.  Conquering dungeons. Solving puzzles. Making progress each day on this adventure (where I guess we aren't saving Zelda and instead making a movie), reminds me how grateful I am for the humor, candor, resilience and determination you each bring every day during our huddles.  I definitely land in a better place because of them. Gannon better watch out!\n\n306#The little things.|I just asked you what could have seriously been a yes or no answer. Yet you, in true Jen fashion, brought in-depth and helpful insight to the situation. You truly know how to work the little things and equip those around you to be better prepared. Thank you!  Ps...this image above needed a place to live and you help so many do better!\n\n307#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n308#Thoughtfully Creative|Thank you so much for thinking about the team and our schedules with all the new school stuff happening in the upcoming weeks. Your heart to reach out and make sure we were all transparent with us and the PM team is SUCH a blessing. Thanks for being you and for making work a place that people can truly bring their whole selves to.   Ps...I wanted to have this random part of one of our conversations shared for all to see....so I attached it as an image.\n\n309#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n310#Building Momentum|Thanks to this team for your time today discussing certified customer stories for Workhuman Live Online. Sometimes it takes an hour or two of good old-fashioned brainstorming to assess where we’re at in the process, identify the key leaders we want involved, and talk through any potential challenges. A special shout out to Eileen, Marie, and Paul for providing additional insight into each of your respective certified customers. Your expertise on collaborating with these accounts is priceless. While it will take a small village to get this over the finish line, there’s no better group of humans positioned to do it. Thanks to everyone for taking on the challenge so we can create something really exceptional alongside our customers.\n\n311#Just, you know, all the things|So, I've been trying to craft this for a while, but I can never find the words that are appropriate for what I'm grateful for. Really, its because its for everything. You my friend, are a force of nature. I am so grateful to have you as a peer to lean on, because your unique perspective almost always makes things better - either directly or indirectly. You truly invest thought in everything that you do, and are such a fun person to bounce ideas around with - regardless of whether they crash or skyrocket - its a BLAST. You recently organized a brainstorm session with a bunch of folks, to take a peek at the October event direction, and elicit some feedback. We were all so into it that we literally had to hop in and out of zoom twice, to be sure we didn't get cut off... Loved it. Thank you for being such an inclusive and collaborative teammate. But most of all thank you for always inspiring the rest of us by bringing your genuine self to the group.\n\n312#Miro, Miro, on the Wall...|We all know how slow some things can be to change. At Workhuman, we have an affinity to powerpoint. What we also have at Workhuman is a plethora of talented artists and creators. Needless to say (or maybe not for some) that powerpoint is not the prefered tool of design for artists, generally speaking. Chris, you enabled us to move forward with pre-production planning using a preferred tool, Miro. You also let us keep using that tool to socialize our work with the marketing VPs. This was a bit of a new method for us but we weathered the storm and came to a place of alignment and shared vision. Chris, James, Jen, and Lauren: No one has ever done anything all on their own and this pre-production work is no different. Thank you for your brains, your eyes, your input, your pushback, your hole-poking, and your collaboration in developing the plan so far. I think we have a solid foundation to begin executing up against. Cheers!\n\n313#Trusting the process!|Team - thank you for buying into and committing to the new process and approach we're using to develop an integrated and collaborative 2H Marketing Plan (ie., offsite, collaboration, data-driven goal setting, etc.). Because of your willingness to lean into this new way of working we've been able to advance new creative, powerful, innovative ideas for 2H digital programming, virtual engagements, and WHL-S that tap into the zeitgeist, create urgency, represent that Companies that thrive Workhuman, in a way that is unique to our Brand and business. With gratitude, Chris & Patti\n\n314#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n315#The future is now. The future is working human.|Team - this group has been the nucleus for \"what's next.\" You've ripped up and thrown away the rule book for what was. You've embraced the freedom, liberation and inspiration that comes from having a blank sheet of paper to operate from. Yes, we've been grinding the last two weeks, but we are on the precipices of exciting concepts that will propel our brand and business forward. Keep pushing, we're nearly there. With gratitude, -C\n\n316#Leadership|Jen, I wanted to send you a huge thank you for your amazing leadership throughout this crazy time! You consistently check in with our team, letting us know if it's a crazy meeting filled day, if you have down time, and asking if there is anything you can do for us. Although there is (social) distance, you make it so that we do not feel disconnected from each other. I appreciate you asking not only how things are going work-wise, but also extending a regular and more personal \"how are you guys feeling?\" Always making sure we are taking care of ourselves and our families during this time. I also appreciate your regular updates on how things are going with decisions around our own events, and our reactions to current events so we don't feel out of the loop. Finally, I thank you for creating a space of trust and open communication as a manager. I always feel I can go to you with questions and open dialogue about growth, projects and whatever else comes our way. THANK YOU for being you!!!!\n\n317#Beautiful teamwork|Once again, I had a front row seat to watch the creative team work their magic. A ridiculous deadline and not a lot of direction didn't stop the show. You tagged each other to make a beautiful ad today. Thank you!\n\n318#Grateful|Jen & Alana, I was reading messages on slack and came to the one you both are in. I'm grateful that I get to work with you both for many reasons. Not only are you both awesome designers, your sooooo funny, considerate, kind, thoughtful, weird, silly, and all around real! If I see something funny I know who I can send it to right away...y'alls. If I need to process an idea...my go toos are right there. I'm leaving that word toos in there cause it kinda says toes but not really. Thanks for making work a place that is fun and a place I know I can talk with friends. <--Grammatically off...but you get the point.\n\n319#Getting on board with Onboarding|Jen, thank you for taking the lead on our new approach to new hire onboarding for Workhuman Live.  With the change in structure and formats – it meant a total revision of how we bring Live to life for our new Humans.  You jumped right in (no shock there) and ‘barfed’ (hey – it’s your term!) a whole deck together in less than a day.  You made it so simple for the rest of the team, and our first run through of it this week went great.  Thanks for always jumping in and being such an amazing teammate.\n\n320#What Makes Us Human: Heart and Soul|Team, when most of us are feeling defeated, deflated, and hopeless, each of you came together to unite our hearts and souls with the people we most want to reach. I shed more than one tear experiencing the imagery and messages of hope and pragmatism. Your respect, empathy, and compassion for all hearts and souls inside and outside of our company has made an impact.  Thank you for transforming a sad exception to our lives into one that brings us together instead of dividing us all.  As always, thank you for your hard work and determination to Workhuman. Best, Patti\n\n321#Social Media Livestream power players!|Thank you to this group of social media power users! You each contributed 5+ posts during the week of Workhuman Livestream, contributing to a company record of over 500 employee posts in a single day. Well done!\n\n322#Fierce commitment to urgency|\"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there IS such a thing as being too late. This is not time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.\" - MLK JR.   Team, since I started just over a month ago, I have heard from many of you and our stakeholders who have talked about the misfortune of joining Workhuman during a global pandemic that has changed every thing about how we live: from how we interact, to what we spend our time and money on, what we value, and how we work.  The truth is, there was no better time for me to be able to witness the magic that is Workhuman. We already know what is important and that is human connection. What you have demonstrated is humanity during a time of extreme urgency - a rarity in life and certainly in business. Thank you for your passion for your and your commitment to each other and our stakeholders.  I am honored to work alongside each of you.\n\n323#WHLive Stream Core Creative|Team, I gotta say when this project dropped on us with the deadline it had - I was shitting my pants.  But after a few days of early conversations and landing on some form of a concept - you started bringing it to life.  Early keynote graphics, scripts and show flows, injection of entertaining segment that made/didn't make the cut,  locking down speakers and schedules, communicating to the execs our executional needs, and the list goes on and on.  It started coming together piece by piece, hour after hour, and then we started figuring out how to steer the project.  I started to feel confident about it.  Live stream vendor was locked.  Content was getting locked.  Filming was locked.  At 12:30pm on 5/12 I hit the equivalent of a big red button and we were broadcasting to the world.  In less than 6 weeks you created a F^*$ing movie. And we didn't want to fight each other after!  I have never done anything this big in such a short time in my career, and I am a grizzled veteran of this world. What a team.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.  Thank you.\n\n324#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n325#Unwavering Commitment. Unrelenting Creativity.|Team, as we head into the final weekend push before Livestream, I wanted to thank you all for your tireless efforts through a constant stream of creative deliverables--across the entire company. Through all the shifts, changes, late nights and same-day turnarounds, you have dug in, adapted and got the job done like the true pros that you are. When I first started six months ago, I wasn't sure exactly what the Innovation = Imagination + Determination equation meant. But you all have shown me every day through countless examples of finding the most creative solutions for what the time and business situation afford. And you do it all with good nature and good humor--which, turns out, is all the more special and needed during a global pan freakin' demic. In any case, I appreciate you all more than you know. Miss seeing you in person. However, I will continue to enjoy seeing the all the fruit of your labors in market. And I am even more excited about the prospect of what this team can do when some level of normalcy is restored. Bless, cl\n\n326#Spotlight Speaker Success Stories|Team - thank you for stepping into the spotlight during our last three marketing town halls. You’ve shown at an exemplary level of innovation, determination, and grit amidst our new normal. You’ve conveyed your success stories (Merck webinar, Keeping work human series, and WHL) with an awesome combination of humility and accessibility. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being leaders of the moment and in the moment. The best practices you’ve shared and modeled to achieve such high levels of success are great guideposts and shining examples of a high performing culture ! Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n327#Recipe for \"Superstar\" Success|What do you get when you combine equal parts \"awesome sauce\" + inspiration + creativity and a little bit of perspiration and magic? Well, you get an incredible Jenn Perry-led keynote address for Workhuman's first-ever Live-stream event. Jenn, thank you so much for rallying the team around this in a highly positive, brand-right, and in the moment keynote speech for Eric. Great stuff! With gratitude, -C\n\n328#Thank you for a warm welcome|I feel so lucky to be a part of the team! The three of you have made me feel super welcome, valued, and supported (and I haven't even done anything yet!) Looking forward to growing the WH brand together.\n\n329#Livestream Launch!|I was going to find an image of a nice stream for this recognition, but the way this team came together and launched – with immediate results (more on that below) – a rocket made more sense.  We have been in a hurry up and wait, start and stop process on bringing a digital/live stream event to market for a bit now.  In the past few weeks it all started to come together, and this past weekend it all really came together.  Our band of weekend warriors once again rallied to pull everything into place and then dragged many more souls into the battle for a rapid Monday launch.  With Dianne at the helm providing impeccable project management and, might I say, a few beatings we were all kept on task.  Jen, Chris, Kevin, and Jay – you were right there every step of the way on design iterations and animations.  Owen, you’ve been a master of the nuanced wordsmithing we’ve needed on this.  Matt, Biz, Geoff and Mark – you built, staged, tested, and launched all new site pages and elements in almost no time at all.  Your work set-up for a great launch – where we dragged in Anthony to build, test, and deploy our emails with about an hours time from asset to release.  Rob and Roshni jumped in to iterate social/digital and bring us live globally.  Colleen, Anne and Jess pulled the enablement tools and comms together and put them in everyone’s hands to help us all share and promote the program.  Mike and Lauren working the external networks to amplify and extend reach.  And Jill.  Maintaining a calm presence, helping align priorities and strategy, and ensuring we’re on track for the overall business goal.  We’re really just a the start of a 3-week journey.  Much work is yet to be done, but you put us in the best possible place to succeed.  So much so, that within hours of launching, we already over 1000 registrants.  Impressive!  I so enjoy working with this team and knowing that together – we can and will deliver!\n\n330#Questions & Answers = Crushing it|The questions were: \"Are you there?\" \"You working?\" \"Can you come inside on this beautiful Sunday?\" The answers from this group were \"Yes!\" \"How can I help?\" \"Be right there!\"  Thank your dedication, time out of your weekend (or your whole weekend), and flexibility. For answering your phone, responding to texts, jumping on calls, endless Slacks, and using Workfront ;-)  Multiple communication channels are needed to launch a promotional campaign in 4 days, over a weekend, while working remotely. I am proud of you, to be a part of this team, and for what we accomplished together. Thank you.\n\n331#Encouraging McEncourager III|I started to send this in slack and was like...nah...other people can speak to this too. Thank you for using your voice to encourage others. Words of affirmation help me know I am going in the right direction. Your AIMs, check-ins, daily verbal high fives are so helpful to me. You are a story teller through and through. When you use this gift to speak to others the weight of them is likened to the greatest duvet cover ever…eva eva. Truly appreciate who you are! THANK YOU!\n\n332#Weekend site updates|We got copy to update the Workhuman Live portion of the corporate site after hours on Friday. Thank you for taking time out of your weekend to answer my messages (Slack/text/email!) and make some quick decisions and edits to the site. Great teamwork!\n\n333#A tough day, a great team|Each one of you exhibited all of our values today but I chose Respect for All because we had a lot of decisions today that required us being in agreement and with a path to move forward very quickly and everyone did it in a respectful, efficient way. This was not a fun meeting - we all love WHL and are dedicated to it being perfect. Today, though we were taking it apart, was no exception. Everyone concentrated on the right message for our audience, thoughtfully went through all affected segments, and delivered a great plan. I'm so proud to work with each one of you and hope we are back together very soon planning '21!\n\n334#IWD Champions!|Jen, Jen and Chris - Thank you for stepping up and being vulnerable enough to share your International Women's Day quote and be the face of our U.S. social posts! Sharing on your own social media is one thing, but being a part of a campaign thats going to be shared on behalf of the organization is something that not everyone may be comfortable with. I appreciate the enthusiasm you all shared for helping us create this campaign, and the great level of care you took in crafting your quotes. Raising awareness  and challenging ourselves to achieve gender equality in the workplace, and in our personal lives, takes many ongoing conversations from many voices. Thank you for being the voices for this particular effort!\n\n335#Team Corona|Coronavirus.  Covid-19.  A giant headache.  We all call it something different – especially because the situation with it has been changing minute by minute and making our decision making process so challenging.  When we made the decision to create new content and FAQ’s for our Workhuman Live site and audiences at 8PM on a Friday night, I crossed my fingers we would be able to activate.  We needed to get information out to our audiences that was clear, consistent, and valuable to ensure they felt informed and at ease.  No surprise – every single one of you stepped up.  Dianne was slacking me almost immediately with project set-up details and timelines.  Lauren had copy in my hands before 6:00 AM (you actually sent it at 1:30!?!)  Chris and Amy were both there to review, edit and get on the phone to talk it through.  Jon had site pages staged and new pop-up functionality built and staged Saturday morning.  Jen and Anthony had layouts and content ready to deploy.  Jill was providing copy strategy and reviews.  Holly and Anne were standing by ready to act as needed for our audiences.  And Lauren – our guiding light and champion of strategy supporting the whole process was as responsive as ever with reviews and feedback.  This is such an evolving and fluid situation, but the team never ceases to amaze me.  You gave up family and weekend time to help ensure our customers had the information they needed, when they needed it.  Your continued dedication and respect for customers, urgency, quality, and teamwork is amazing.  Thank you – and Cheers to Team Corona.\n\n336#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n337#We have lift off!|I wanted to thank all of you for the total team effort that was the creation and launch of the new Workhuman Live Europe website. This was an incredibly fast turnaround with many moving parts, from implementing new branding to building a preliminary agenda to getting Bizzabo up and running for registration. It's hard to believe that in the middle of an already crazy few weeks this team was able to quietly and efficiently create a fantastic new site that will introduce more of the world to the amazing experience that is Workhuman Live. Well done!\n\n338#Humans Unite!|Team - I wanted to recognize a tremendous display of urgency, creativity, and teamwork to overhaul the existing creative approach for WHL audience acquisition and event campaigns. In just 48 hours (and I think you used all of those hours ;), you responded to our call to action and put forward a compelling, thoughtful, hard hitting, and provocative new approach to this campaign. I believe it will help us meet our goals, and provide a whole new influencing lens on the broader suite of marketing and brand elements we go to market with. From the stat + fact formula powered by WorkHuman IQ \"3-ups\", to the big, bold, palettes and voice shared ... our fellow humans will definitely not want to be a \"Mo\" come May 11th. Thank you for the hard work, quick action, and hyper-focus that generated very exciting and high quality creative. Keep it coming! With gratitude, -C\n\n339#Breakfast Club|Thank you all for coming in on a Saturday to test the WHL session registration module before we promote it. It is critical to our success that this functions properly, is easy to use, and correct messages are conveyed all without disrupting ongoing reg. I’m proud to be part of a team with such dedication. I appreciate all of you.\n\n340#Making Sense through the Chaos|Jen, Thank you so much for all the work you've done on all of the experiences for WHL lately. There are so many ideas, events, words, spaces, and designs and you have an incredible ability to take it all in, select the best, put in order, and articulate your vision so that we keep this train moving. As always, I appreciate you.\n\n341#Ignite US 2020|Huge thank you to all of you for every part you played in this years US Ignite!  Content, speaker requests, dry runs.  Fresh new design for Ignite and getting all the creative requests through.  Activations for attendees to take part in, possibly seeing a small sneak peek of what might be seen at this years WHL.  Video's, opening videos, traveling out of country to make videos!  Walk in music, imbedding videos into presentations, adjusting presentations, walk out music, directing PSAV crew onsite.  WH Gives coordination, helping out at registration getting badges and jackets out.  Setting up and breaking down back drops and activations as well as setting up and breaking down for the gold party.  Coordinating signups for breakouts and dine arounds, changing reservations up to the last minute.  Filling your cars with all the items that needed to get there and then filling them again to get them back to the office so they can be prepared to travel across the pond.  Having a smile on your face, answewring many questions, getting plenty of steps in\n\n342#Ignite Core Team|It’s hard to decide which value to recognize the members of the Ignite Core team for.  There was a commitment to teamwork, quality and our internal customers.  Colleen and I decided to go with Respect for Urgency since you all worked so hard to pull this event together in a very short time.  Jenn S and Melissa – no idea how you were able to find 33 restaurants to host dine-a-rounds, pull off the amazing Gold party, and all the other details that somehow came together in weeks.  Mark – not sure how you stay so calm as we’re constantly changing slides, the agenda and all the other technical needs.  Somehow you did and were able to deliver an amazing experience for our humans.  Jenn P – Again, in an incredibly short time, you were able to visualize and produce some engaging activations to enhance the experience for all.  Aimee – you were willing to step in and do whatever needed to be done, including taking care of a team member who was ill.  Lauren, Kate, Sarah, and Niamh – your partnership and responsiveness as we constantly looked for input, approvals, etc. was second to none.  Your guidance and energy were key to this process.  Thank you all and we look forward to working with you to make the Dublin experience amazing!\n\n343#Passing the Baton|Thanks Team #3 for a great Ignite Solutions session! So many creative yet practical ideas for our customers to encourage their employees to use the platform and practice gratitude consistently. Shout outs to Rachel, Andy and Jen for presenting, James for organizing, Sarah for running the brainstorm and capturing the brilliance on paper, Mark S. for \"Dick's Day\" and Tim G. for pigeons. Not forgetting Claire, Jess, Mark A. and Tim M. - you were ALL engaged in the conversation with impressive \"yes, and...\" & fine-tuning and truly collaborated with respect. Let's reconvene for Innovations 2020!\n\n344#Fellow Sushi Astronauts|Thanks to each of you for taking the time to leave the safe bubble of the hotel, then joining as a group for dinner at Fuji! It was great to get to know everyone better and to have the opportunity for some stimulating discussion. I look forward to seeing each of you again soon, and if anyone ever wants to do another sushi dinner in future just let me know!\n\n345#Neon for days!|Creative geniuses, the design of this years Ignite was simply stunning. It was bright, colorful, purposeful and exciting! The way you carried through the entire concept from the opening video, the Workhuman Cloud icons, to the lanyards was superb. There is so much effort that goes into all the details that truly made this special. You are a dream creative force, I'm incredibly proud of you all.\n\n346#Ignite Keynote|Many thanks to you all, especially you Jen, for the work you did on the Ignite Keynote! Always amazing to see how it comes together in the end. Never doubted it for a second (cough, cough!). It's always a high stakes project, and one where we set the bar absurdly high. I enjoyed presenting it and believe we now have at least half the Workman Live keynote! A lot of creative minds and produce great things. Now onward to Dublin and San Antonio! Thank You!\n\n347#Acceleration and adoption breakout|Breakout team presenters-you all stepped up and volunteered to present the brainstormed ideas on how customers can reach their employees and continue to drive adoption within their recognition program. There was a diverse group of us coming together with fresh perspectives and out of the box thinking. You were able to take everyone’s ideas on paper and robustly delivered great context behind each theme. Great job team! Hope we can implement some of these ideas in real life!\n\n348#Hackathon for the Ages!|Amazing team, I cannot thank each and every one of you enough for your brilliance during the second Workhuman Live Hackathon this week! First and foremost, with Ignite around the corner;  there is no shortage things to get accomplished, GREATLY appreciate the time taken out of your busy days to help us crowdsource ideas and think differently to capture the excitement AND carry it forward, even when WH Live 2020 comes to an end. Nice work being respectful brainstormers and challenging one another. I am so excited to put these ideas in action against our personas and a timeline. We have never been in better shape to make the most of Workhuman Live and it's because of this group, Cheers to you all!\n\n349#Ignite 2020 is going to be hot!|While I might be biting my nails and bouncing my foot anxiously trying to get artwork out to the print vendors for Ignite, I do respect the quality of the work your beautiful minds have put together! Alana, your concept for 2020 Ignite is gorgeous! Way to bring us something fresh and showcase your talents in a new way! Jen, you helped steer people who are going off track in the right direction. You reminded people to include me when it was obvious a PM should be involved. You are fully supporting your team to make the best decisions and guide design even further in a stunning direction! You made yourself available to jump in and help. We all know you’re also spending time getting Eric’s keynote perfected on top of everything else. Thank you for all the time you both put in to everything you do to make the most of this amazing event!\n\n350#You bring value and awesomeness on the daily!|Jen...I got to go to NYC with you and realized even more how awesome you are. You think differently about things...IE...people, places, things (been playing Madlibs lately), etc. You are constantly connecting things and weaving a beautiful thread through your connections, thought processes, and your work. In the classroom you brought such great insights and POV to the discussions and you (like you do) made people get closer to each other. That is a gift!  I got to see that gift in action all week long. You would jump into conversations with people we met (ie uber ride sharing peeps) and had I just gotten in to the car I would have assumed you had know them for 10+ years.  It is a blessing to be on your team and to get to see how you mind and creativity work.   To top it all off, I was never bored. Who can say they can hang out with their boss and not be bored? ......ME! Thanks for making my NYC experience 100X better by being you!\n\n351#28 this quarter!|28 humans. That's how many people assisted in one way or another with the Q4 year-end, last meeting of the decade and for each and every one of you, I am grateful! It's pretty incredible to think about the village that comes together to make this meeting happen. From confirming our speakers, creating slides, providing content, answering my many questions, testing and testing and testing (yes, 3x) the technology to provide a great experience for all, to ringing the gong - each of you receiving this award was integral to the overall success of the meeting.\n\n352#2021|Thank you both for jumping on a plane for a whirlwind trip to cities in 4 days looking for the next location for WHL. The event has grown to the point that we have to start securing venues years out to ensure we have the right location to provide the experience that our attendees expect from WHL. I know that no one wants to travel this time of year but you both packed your bags and came home with some great recommendations.\n\n353#Thanks for your support!|Jen, Thank you for all of your support and guidance during my first Workhuman trip!  I appreciate you taking the time to answer all of my questions as well as providing thoughtful insights throughout the week.  I found the trip to be enjoyable, productive and a helpful learning experience.  Thank you again!!\n\n354#Bringing the MCW Vision to Life!|I am so proud of this creative team! Thank you for all of your support and for sharing your creative talent for our first ever booth presence at the MA Conference for Women! The concept and design was absolutely amazing and drove some great foot traffic. The alignment of the booth design with our brand, and the activation of the 'Wear who you Are' stickers was so well received and exactly in line with what our mission is at workhuman. These assets made it easy for attendees to connect the dots and understand who we are. Thank you for guiding me through this process and providing your strong expertise along the way! I'm so happy to get to work with such an amazing group of creative minds who get it done RIGHT - every. single. time.\n\n355#WH Live  - we hit our first milestone!!!!|Team,  I am so proud of, energized and inspired by each of you!  We have hit our first milestone!  Your creativity, dedication and action bias have been evident from day 1!   I truly look forward to taking this exceptional movement forward with this tremendously talented team. On behalf of everyone that will be lucky enough to enjoy WH Live, Thank You!\n\n356#Cyber Monday!|As I sit here looking back on the past 2 ½ days, I am in awe at what this team has just pulled off.  It's one thing to think about rolling out a massive multi-day / multi-touch / multi-channel campaign with weeks of planning … but we decided to do so much more.  In just these 2 ½ days, we have managed to launch housing to all audiences, which included segmented email deployments, multiple site updates, platform updates, rebuilding every confirmation email, design, social, and more!  Buy why leave it at that?  We also pushed out the Justify your Trip content.  Custom letters by audience, site updates, design changes, functionality tweaks.  And even took the time to redesign and rebuild Eric’s Keynote page.  On top of all this – Cyber Monday went out the door today.  I started doing the math on the executional elements we have for this one campaign, but ran out of fingers, toes, and strands of hair to count on.  We basically crammed week’s worth of work into just two days, like it was nothing.  But it was everything!  This was no small feat, and every one of you played a role in pulling it off (almost) seamlessly.  The results are not in (yet), but this could not wait because we have completely set ourselves up for success thanks to all of you.  I so appreciate your focused commitment to the success of Workhuman Live.\n\n357#An Outstanding Start|Thank you all for your participation in this weeks site visit. We accomplished an outstanding amount of work in 2 days - identifying great venues and experiences for all of our evening events, thoughtfully putting together the beginnings of our WHC plan, and running through the details of what will be an amazing few days in May.  And, you all did this while keeping up with all of your day jobs. Thank you for bringing your A-game to all that you did this week.\n\n358#Workhuman live 2020 usability hub vision|This is a well over due one! I want to thank you both for all your input into my initial proposal for the usability lab at Workhuman live 2020! From my initials pitch you both were very welcoming and open to the idea and straight away provided feedback and direction to myslef and the team for how to progress forward with the idea. As we kept meeting more and more ideas came up all I favour of enhancing the experience of the attendees at Workhuman as well as helping the products teams to learn about our users! After every session with you i feel so inspired by your positive attitude and creativity! I’m so excited to see how this is going to come to life and looking forward to collaborate more! Thak you\n\n359#The wow factor!|Jen  - you never cease to amaze me. I love what you've created for our front desk in Framingham. What a beautiful, fresh and lively first impression for everyone who comes into our space. We changed our name to Workhuman months ago but the new signage was well worth the wait! I can't help but smile when I look at it. It's more than a sign. It's an art installation. Thank you for the creativity and warmth you weave into all that you do. This is simply gorgeous!\n\n360#Defining Success|Chris, Jen, and Maureen - I want to thank you all for the thoughtful approach you took to looking at the creative team structure. You all went above and beyond the ask to create a vision for the team that can leverage each team members unique skills. In the middle of all of the day to day work that each of you has on their plate, you took time to meet, discuss, and effectively communicate a plan that will provide clarity and a path for growth on the team. Gratitudes all around!\n\n361#The road to London|Thank you for helping with last-minute print files for London Executive Forum. We wait till the very last minute to have the most accurate details and to include the latest registrants which puts pressure on you, but you rise to the occasion and respond quickly. I appreciate it!\n\n362#Certified Human Effort|Ladies, I really appreciate the quick turn on getting the second round of concepts for Human Certified where they needed to be. Seeing the way you both work made me very comfortable that we would have a great meeting, which was selfishly important for me given this was/is my first real project here at Workhuman. So thanks for being strategic and thoughtful and not sacrificing craft while moving at warp speed in between everything else you have going on. Great things to come!\n\n363#You Delivered a Breakthrough Moment!|Belated thanks to each of you – Jess, Jen and Maureen – for the breakthrough moment you delivered on the WHCE project a couple of weeks ago. We'd been struggling with endless edits and inputs on the wording of the rights statements, trying to deliver on the bold vision for the program. Simultaneously you all were working away on ideas for the program's marketing campaign. When we put the two together it was pure magic! Not only were your mock-ups beautiful, reflecting a number of fresh, edgy, on-message design directions, but they delivered a key breakthrough moment where we realized that the provocative, disruptive impact we were striving for in the words should come from the combo of the words AND graphics. A \"duh\" moment for you marketing pros, but an \"aha\" one for me! You made the clear distinction between the marketing campaign and the program itself, which took the pressure off the words themselves and has allowed us to put the continued brainstorming on words to bed. Brilliant! It was such a pinnacle contribution that moved the project forward in a way that really embodied the spirit of our Innovation = Imagination + Determination value. I’m so grateful to each of you for that piece of work in particular, as well as having your passion and design wisdom as a resource on this critical project. Thank you!\n\n364#Team Workhuman Live giving me liiiiffeeee|Just wanted to say how awesome it has been working with the 3 of you on Workhuman® Live 2020! Jen - I really missed collaborating and creating with you and am so happy to see you absolutely thriving in your semi-new role! It's been great to see how enthusiastically you are now tackling the conception of each and every piece we create from both a visual perspective as well as a tone/voice perspective. I think it's going to pay huge dividends in tying together the messaging we are pushing out for a cohesive event both promotionally and on-site. Kevin - you are so fun to work with and I love how you approach everything with an easy attitude and constantly adding value when it counts. Your recent Instagram stories had such a unique perspective and I am excited to see how they perform. Plus, you are always willing to pounce on little things (fire drills) like the newsletter placement you just turned around for me in LESS THAN AN HOUR!!!! Alana - I love that you have been so willing and open to learn about all the different channels/tactics we are using for the audience acquisition plan! It's a great quality that I really admire and I think it shows that you are committed to understanding everything we are putting out from conception through to launching, performance, and analysis. Plus, your hand-written scripts are giving so much liiifffeeee to our web, social, display, email assets and more! Love working with you guys - best in the biz! xo\n\n365#Amazing Creative Review!|Jen thank you so much for this morning's onboarding for  Creative Services & Corp. Marketing! You did an amazing job covering the full history of Workhuman, and you can really tell how much time you, Jess and the entire creative team put into creating such an amazing brand.  It's always great to get the creative standpoint on things because it really helps bring the overall mission to life. The session was fun, and helped initiate that SPARK in all us newbies.  Fabulous Job!!! :)\n\n366#Stronger Together|Jen - I don't know what I'd do without you. Everyday you inspire me to think harder and smarter about everything I do. Together we face so many challenges and opportunities and I can almost see your brain churning as I wait to hear what I know will be the first thought of an idea that will make this company and our events better. I treasure our teamwork, our collaboration, and our friendship and I don't tell you often enough. You often describe what you do as picking the colors but we all know what an understatement that is. You make every experience meaningful, unique, and relevant to our business. I would describe what I do as making Jen Perry's ideas become a reality and that's a pretty awesome way to spend my days.\n\n367#It Takes an Army|I want to extend a special thank you to everyone involved in bringing together the Taste of Workhuman Live event series. Amanda/Amy for pulling together graticards, gratitude journals, speakers, coordinating content, setting up briefing meetings, and keeping everyone on track. Jess/Jen/Mike for the execution of campaign materials numerous operations requests, and fast turn-around timelines. Lynette - for being the rockstar that I knew you would be speaking at our events. Thanks for your constant energy and passion you bring to everything that you do. Also, for helping set up at Raleigh and Atlanta. Mark - for stepping up, helping research and cover for me while I was on vacation. Mike - for coming in last minute and saving the day with Laurie Ruettiman to speak at our events. Everyone made these events successful and spectacular. Thank you all!\n\n368#My 'go to' this week|Jen - I asked many things of you this week, all without notice. Whipping up a few Exec Forum name plates? Sure! Making edits to existing files to cover for a designer taking a long weekend? Okay! Creating a banner for a reg page you knew nothing about at first? Yes, tell me more about it! Thank you for your flexibility and positive attitude to last minute things. I appreciate you!\n\n369#Thinking here, way over there, and then back.|Sitting in the Ring the Gong announcement I got to sit next to you. During the meeting you gave me more insights into workhuman® and why AstraZeneca is such a big client to get. After the meeting I got to hear more. It was in that moment I realized how forward thinking and innovative you are. You have a way of explaining workhuman and projects that make me want to get more involved. There have been many times where you share ideas for the workhuman live event and I’m standing there like….how did you get there & that is a brilliant idea. Thank you for being someone who shares freely and creatively all the while not making anyone feel left out.\n\n370#supporting the new girl!|Jen took it upon herself this morning to pop by and see if I was available and interested this morning in joining the women's network monthly meeting. . Something I may not have known about otherwise, she has continued to make myself and other newbies feel part of the team in less than a week at WH so thank you!!\n\n371#Workhuman Live Power Session!|Jenn, thank you so much for jumping in to help with Bring Your Gratitude to Work Day by presenting on Workhuman Live! The undertaking of this event is so gargantuan - and trying to fit it all into a presentation of just 10 minutes is no easy feat! I'm so glad that you embraced this opportunity to share the event with our very special guests - and you really showcased how impactful the event is, and how it's disrupting the HR conference world! Thank you for jumping into action so quickly and enthusiastically to bring this session to life!\n\n372#Gratitude Day in Framingham!|There is literally not enough Gratitudes to give for what this team pulled off yesterday! What an amazingly human experience we were able to provide to all of our loved ones, who took time out of their day to come learn about what we do! There was so much innovation, imagination and determination, that went into making this one of the most special internal events we have done! My inbox has been buzzing with so many heartfelt messages from your guests, my face hurts from smiling! Thank you all so much for helping this idea come to life! Special shout out to Kristen Banks, the mastermind behind it all.. I hope you're smiling just as much too! To quote one of the emails I received from an attendee \" We will be talking about this day for a long time to come!\" I couldn't agree more! Outstanding work team!\n\n373#Group wisdom!|Team - I just wanted to express my gratitude and excitement coming out of today’s sprint retrospective. What a great discussion around our insights from the past couple of weeks. Not only did we celebrate our shared successes but we also looked ahead to future goals and examined realistic ways to achieve them as a team. I hope we continue having these “after parties” in the future as I feel they are a shining example of cross-team collaboration at its finest! Great job everyone and thank you for taking the time today!\n\n374#Making a list and checking it twice|I loved collaborating with you both on the wish list of must-haves vs nice-to-haves in prep for today's EBC meeting. We synthesized the ideas into a cohesive format and you were able to walk the team through a discussion that was thoughtful and productive. We even ended the meeting a few minutes early! Well done!!\n\n375#Best Looking Site in Show|Wow the new Workhuman Live site looks incredible. The color scheme is great, the new motion graphics look awesome, and the videos are integrated so well. Working with you all has been an incredible experience. You all are insanely talented, and it is a pleasure to be a part of a team with you all. I know the site is only going to look better as we add more content to it, and I can't wait to see what you else you guys create!!\n\n376#The highest of high fives!|When you start a new job you are wondering how working with your boss will be. You hope it will go smooth but you have to wait and see. Will they challenge you, will they be able to explain vision, design edits, will they help you grow as a designer and as an individual? I can say yes to all of these for you Jen. You have a joy about you and this fountain of inspiration and being able to beautifully express it all. Your thoughts on how people can work together all the while allowing us as designers to be free to create is such a blessing. Then add the life part into the mix. Flora’s arrival and first couple of weeks were not only a blur but kinda heavy. You ever so graciously extended peace about work, help if needed, and words of encouragement. I'm very grateful to have you as my boss and to be on your team! ✨\n\n377#Workhuman Live Web MVPs!|Today we kicked off the 2020 WorkHuman Live web campaign with the MVP launch of the new workhumanlive.com thanks to the incredible efforts of this team. I was so impressed with creativity and skill you all brought to every phase of design and development. From our initial brainstorming session earlier this summer through every morning sprint there was always a drive to innovate and improve our online experience, while remaining hyper focused on our goal to drive registrations. You all took great care through your work to represent the very best of the Workhuman brand and on-site experience. This was only the beginning of what I’m sure what will be an exciting year. I can’t wait to see what we can we accomplish together!\n\n378#Bottling the Experience!|As a parent, I have heard (and used) the phrase “It takes a village.”  I believe that same idea applies to many of the business challenges we encounter.  Being asked to develop a marketing approach to Bottle Workhuman Live – I knew right away it would take a village.  And WOW – did you all step up.  Taking three hours out of your afternoon to participate in our first ever ‘Bottle Workhuman Live Hack-a-Thon’ was a big ask in the midst of so many competing priorities.  Yet, every one of you jumped at the change.  You even took the time to do some homework in advance and help formulate the direction of the workshop.  You changed schedules to be there.  You came focused and ready.  You gave it your all!  I now have a 20 page deck of ideas to leverage – to create some fun, exciting, bold and disruptive marketing from.  All thanks to you.  I have a deep appreciation for every one of you.  Thank you!\n\n379#B is for Bizzabo|When you are working with a new vendor using new software, and the main contact with that vendor is no longer involved... you need a Plan B. Thank you all for being part of Plan B for Bizzabo. You were ready, willing, able, nimble, and responsive in getting up to speed with the platform. You set up the program, tested it, connected it, troubleshooted, learned the ins and outs, developed copy and creative, and collectively tackled the Bizzabo beast!   Thank you for all of your time and attention in a very important step on the trail to San Antonio. The Workhuman Live 2020 reg site is open for bizzness because of your efforts - cheers!\n\n380#Speaker Recommendations|I’d like to take a moment to thank each of you for recommending Workhuman Live speakers and/or encouraging individuals to submit as part of our call for papers. Lynette & Alex, you’re wonderful partners to the content team on this front. You always let us know once you leave a conference or Evanta if any speakers stood out to you. Jen, you always have Workhuman Live on the brain and you’re quick to share an article or idea that we can potentially leverage on the mainstage or during breakout sessions.  John & Kieran, thank you for taking the time to bring names and companies to our attention that support our international efforts. I’m looking forward to expanding our global speaker network. Chris & Corinne, we had multiple applicants who noted that they applied after speaking with you. Thanks for being advocates of the movement and educating those in your networks about potential opportunities to engage with us.\n\n381#WHL2020 Team|Thank you all for coming to San Antonio and collaborating  on what will be the best WHL yet. This pre planning work is so essential in creating the experience and all of you came with your best ideas, concentrated on your areas, looked at the big picture, and came back with a solid plan to move forward. Thank you for being such a great team.\n\n382#My mentor.|Jen, I really wanted to thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to have lunch with me the other day. From the beginning (in a previous life before Globoforce/WH was known to us) you took me under your wing as a young designer fresh out of college. You made sure I was given the opportunities to learn and further my career – even in the early days. I truly can say that I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for your amazing mentorship. And I'm proud to say that I've been able to literally follow in your footsteps and take all your teachings to interns and junior designers I have since looked after. I can't tell you how many phrases of yours that have stuck with me. You are such a ray of sunshine. You've always had a positive and inspiring attitude that is contagious. You see the good in everyone and everything and are willing to do whatever it takes to make something the best it can be. You have an imagination that can't be matched and are able to make the impossible come to life. I'm so lucky to have had you by my side through the early days of my career AND to work at a company that focuses on the growth of their employees and encourages mentorships (especially across departments). Thank you for always being here for me personally and professionally. I look forward to more lunches and teaching moments as my Workhuman career continues and grows. Thank you for being an amazing human.\n\n383#Creative Humans!|Jen, Alana and Kevin - Thank you all so much for your quick and creative minds for our TechJam event! Being first time sponsors we really need to make a splash, and boy did you all cannonball! Our presence was really felt from the brightness in the backdrop banner to our awesome human t-shirts that really got everyone talking.  We really appreciate all of the support that you provided prior to the event to really make this a great brand opportunity for Workhuman! Thanks again for all that you do!\n\n384#Super Fast Response|Thank you all so much for dropping everything to help out with this important request from Unilever. It came directly from the top and is for a key meeting with Unilever's new CEO. Recognition is very much on their agenda and the creative work you pulled together within a matter of hours, will be used to illustrate the global direction they are taking. The VP Global Reward specifically requested that I pass on her sincere appreciation for the work you've done on this. THANK YOU!!\n\n385#Wh Live Agenda Building|Many thanks to this group for your time brainstorming the Workhuman Live agenda layout. Now is the time for us to look at different options and ask all of the questions. “How many sessions is the right amount?” “Where can there be more facilitated networking?” And most importantly, “What can we do next year that’s new and different?” Next step, our site visit in two weeks to test some layouts and floor plans!\n\n386#What a Brainstorm|There’s nothing like a three-hour meeting, sandwiched between the company meeting, a marketing vp meeting, and countless other commitments.  Yet, every one of you came with your A-Game – ready to brainstorm a whole new approach to the Workhuman Live website experience.  Thank you all for showing up focused, open-minded, and collectively in alignment on exceeding our audiences’ expectations through the site.  Reimagining a website is never easy, especially when trying to set aside what we already know to try new things.  Every one of you stepped up to share your areas of expertise and add value into the overall plan.  Your input was so valuable and is helping to frame out an exceptional site plan for 2020.\n\n387#10 minutes?|Jen, thank you so much for jumping in to help me with some formatting on three slides for the company meeting. When you offered to help in one area, and I didn't need it, but tried to grab you for another area, you didn't hesitate to help. Your 10 minutes of magic made a difference and I appreciate your partnership! Thank you.\n\n388#Creativity and Execution at its best!|It really is a massive physical and mental effort when you have the Global CHRO of a company like Schneider Electric bringing 29 of his Executives from all over the world to a Learning Expedition at our HQ. Throw in the fact that we've never done anything like it and the pressure becomes very real! Luckily we belong to the Workhuman family where we excel in creativity and teamwork! You have all played a key role in bringing the vision of the day to life and have been working tirelessly behind the scenes! I had so many creative asks that had the added component of demonstrating that we are aligned in values and even the initiatives that they were passionate about (sustainability, D&I, CSR  to name a few hah!) and it didn't end there - of course we had to make sure that all of this led them down a path that would fuel them to take action to do more with us in partnership and within their StepUp recognition program. You all came through and orchestrated it all so beautifully. From the amazing artwork in multiple languages, the gratitude bar, creating video montage, getting WH live content ready and approved just to name a few! When their Global CHRO thanked me for an amazing day and an unparalled learning experience, I shared that there is an extremely talented team of heros behind me that he did not get the opportunity to meet and he wanted me to extend his thank yous as well. While you were not there to share in that experience with us personally, know that you were all thought of and your efforts at the flawless execution have not gone unnoticed. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!\n\n389#Strategic Experience Mapping Workshops|A big thanks to all of you for coming to the Experience Mapping Workshops ready to share ideas of how we can use WH to help achieve our company goals. It was fantastic to see how aligned everyone is! Your time and dedication will help create the best WH yet with carefully curated experiences that will inspire all attendees and customers. Great job everyone.\n\n390#SO. MUCH. FUN!|You were all rockstars in our brainstorming meeting for the Executive Briefing Center. You did your homework and came prepared, we were energized, laughed a lot, and came up with some amazing ideas that we shared! I loved how quickly we all bonded together as a tiger team, it made me smile watching all the connections, how one idea fed another, they all wove like a dance. Where did the time go? This is a huge initiative for our company and I couldn't be more grateful for the team I get the pleasure of working with.\n\n391#Minimally Viable Presentation|MVP TEAM! WOW! What an amazing feat pulling together one of the best narratives we ever had presented at the ELT meeting today! The information flowed, they were wowed, they laughed, it showed our strengths and highlighted our successes. You ALL were integral to making this come to life, especially during the last minute crunch hours (YAY BRUINS!!!) I was so honored to re-pre-sent all that Marketing has been working on what's to come. You are a fantastic group of humans, so grateful to work with you.\n\n392#Bringing the Grat Bar to life!|What a great brainstorm session we had this week to start the initial thoughts on bringing the Grat Bar to life! It's such a pioneering experience and can really increase awareness and adoption of our brand and product. We are just scratching the surface but I know this team will be able to do amazing things and show the world what we can do! SXSW here we come!\n\n393#Making Time to Brainstorm|Dan, Lauren, Jen, and Geoff, thanks so much for your time during our call for speakers brainstorming session. It's helpful to hear new and exciting ideas on how we can update the call for speakers webpage. The design layout plays a huge role in how an applicant  absorbs who we are and what we're looking for. The text on the page needs to match the voice and tone of Workhuman while still being practical and instructional. We're on our way to creating a new template that serves all of these needs. I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out!\n\n394#Nailing the interview|Jen, there's a group of interviewing a candidate tomorrow for a designer opening. Thank you for taking the time to think through what we want to get out of the process. You gave each of us a good understanding of what role this candidate might fill and how the position could potentially evolve over time. And then, you provided each of us brief but thorough interview notes - specific topics for everyone to focus on. While I previously read the candidate's resume, now I suddenly feel way more prepared knowing specifically what I should look for during my portion of the interview. Plus, having a general idea of what my peers are going to talk to the candidate about provides great context setting. This was very helpful. I appreciate the time and thought you put into ensuring we ALL nail the interview!\n\n395#Team Coverage|Jen - Thanks for stepping in and helping us out this week with a design review.  You willingly and quickly stepped up to the plate and helped us move our program along.  You have a great team full of talented players, and it was reassuring and motivating to see how you work together and cover for each other when needed.\n\n396#Go get em attitude!|Thank you so much Jen for being a great support in Maureen’s absence today. You listened. You supported. You collaborated. You offered great advice and next steps. You made it all seem so easy. Right when we needed you, you really came through. We don’t get to work together often, but today reminded me of how willing you are to get to the bottom of something and get answers! Much appreciated!\n\n397#Taking our moments brainstorm to the next level!|Team - what a great session today!  Thank you for your time, energy, passion and inspiration!  We came out of our moments brainstorm which was focused on elevating our pre-pitch and pitch meeting engagements with a solid strategy to take these two game-changer moments to the next level! I am so excited for our check-in scheduled for May 6 to agree how our \"experimental\" strategy will come to life!  You guys are the most awesome colleagues!  Our session was fun, inclusive and full of inspiration!  I love working with you all!  Thank you for showing up with such positivity and commitment and thank you for doing all the prep work so that we could maximize out time together - way to live RESPECT!  Thank you!\n\n398#Taking it all in stride|Jen, you just got back from vacation and so many things fell in your lap this week. You were so willing to step in and help the team where need be - you brought such great ideas, feedback, and support. I want to thank you for taking it all in stride and being there for us!\n\n399#Gratitudes for our breakout group leaders|Thank you for stepping up to lead the practice area breakout groups today. It was a packed agenda that I tried to choreograph down to the last minute and last detail. I felt completely at ease with the five practice area team presentations because I knew I had awesome leaders guiding the way. The teams were cross functional spanning all areas of our department including some new faces from our PR firm, but in watching everyone interact with each other, you would have thought we worked really closely together for decades. So much collaboration and lively discussion. Insightful presentations....It was a beautiful thing. Thanks again for your leadership.\n\n400#Persona Workshop Warriors Unite!|I have such a grateful heart for this day, this entire team of Marketing mavens, and all the opportunities that sit within our reach. I have never felt more connected to our team than I do at this very moment. We just completed an all hands, all day persona workshop! Woohoo!!! Thank you for your investment. Thank you for being a kind audience that stayed engaged. Thank you for asking thoughtful questions. Thank you for your humor and your patience. Thank you for being real. Thank you for embracing the 7 1/2 hour marathon persona training session we shared today with gusto and heart! I truly believe that we will be a better team, and we will produce better marketing because of the time we spent together today. I can’t wait to hear your feedback about the agenda, the learning modules, the wiki….ALL the things! I can’t wait to apply this first body of persona work to our marketing efforts. Let’s GOOOOOOO!\n\n401#Learning about our customers and future customers|Congratulations wiki quiz winners! Thank you for taking the time to explore the wiki and learn more about our HR audiences. Wiki, wiki, wiki!!!!!!\n\n402#What will our favorite food be next year?|That’s what I’m worried about because I don’t have to give a thought about how many great ideas you will have or how beautiful Workhuman will be next year. I love our partnership on this event. I love every time there is an inkling of an idea, you turn it into something great. Like from the moment we ate that hot chicken, we knew we needed to share it with others and turned into a fantastic event. I know someday I will look back on all the good times we have and the synergy with Sparks and think those were the best of times. I hope I get to do this event with you for many, many more years to come.\n\n403#J&J|While most people will see J&J and think \"Johnson&Johnson\" (even myself in customer experience), I now think of it as Jill&Jen! You two have been incredible leading up to and during Workhuman Live. I appreciate you giving me access to be part of the \"core team\" and be involved in so many things that are new to my role and give me a better understanding of the inner workings of the event. Jill - you never miss a thing. Not one! Always on top of every single detail and that is SO appreciated. You are a master! Jen - your creativity inspired me to thing bigger and better every time. You helped me create a vision for items in the lounge that were an absolute HIT! Thank you for sharing your beautiful brain! HUGE thank you to the both of you for all you do day in and day out to make Workhuman Live incredible and inspiring.\n\n404#QA+|To my long time partner in the agency world, thank you for being my second set of eyes on the follow-up Workhuman microsites for prospects, customers, and executives. While time is of the essence, so is quality for our Workhuman Live attendees. When I needed someone to review comments and feedback with, you said \"pull up a chair and let's do this together.\" A true human connection that was efficient, necessary, and productive. Thank you for your time and insight as we worked together to problem-solve and prioritize. I hope there are more of these moments in our future!\n\n405#Mighty Microsite Effort|The follow-up content for Workhuman Live attendees took many windy turns over the last few months, but this team turned it around and delivered three excellent microsites in very little time. While we had some bumps and bruises along the way (all to be discussed and ironed out for next time), the deliverables will be so helpful for future customers, customers, and our Executive Forum attendees. We’ve evolved from PowerPoint action plans to a comprehensive follow-up experience that includes a lighter version of the action plan, and links to the survey, credits, breakout session PDFs, call for speakers, blog posts, and unique content for customers and Executive Forum attendees. Geoff – you worked tirelessly on the code; Brian – you spent hours on the breakout session uploads while providing guidance; and Jen – you stepped in for the necessary QA and provided photos. Dianne – thanks for keeping us on track, and Aaron – thanks for managing the process and for writing the copy for the action plan. This was a superior team effort and I am grateful for each one of you.\n\n406#Piling on the Love!|Warren Bennis said \"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality\" and to see your 'all white and light' Nashville 2019 concept come to life made me so proud. You did an amazing job with your first Workhuman Event as the Creative Lead. The look and feel was astounding, everyone was blown away by the creativity, the modern appeal, the bright colors. It all starts with a bunch of stickies and a pinterest board, I was lucky enough to sit on couches and pivot crazy ideas with you. Clouds! Cotton Candy! Rainbows! LEDs! WOOD TYPE! COWBELLS! The list goes on and on. The keynote has been hailed as one of the best to date, the Husk dinner a thing of beauty, the activations fun and captivating. GREAT, GREAT JOB and can't wait to see what you and the team come up with next year.\n\n407#The Best Workhuman Yet!|Jen and Ellen, congratulations on delivering an absolutely incredible experience for our customers and future customers. We had our fair share of challenges, but each one was overcome with aplomb and grace while you remained focused on delivering something exceptional. Workhuman continues to be the best conference I have ever personally attended, and judging from the reaction of our attendees - they agree wholeheartedly! Well done!\n\n408#Got my back at WH!|Workhuman is always a big team effort, but you 3 are the ones that worked closest with me, making sure we had quality, up to date information to present.   You 3 always had my back from content preparation, design, rehearsals, the right thing to say at any time.... and much more!   Thank you for being a great team to work with, always having an eye for quality & the attendees interest.   And, what a great success has once again been delivered!  I am grateful to work with such talented people. Thank you!\n\n409#Workhuman 2019|It takes a village to plan, prep and launch the good ship Workhuman! Your contribution was immense, in either the design and management of the event, or as one of the key speakers at the event - or sometimes both! Workhuman is our flagship marketing event in the year and it is impossible to overstate its importance. You also represent the other 500 people at Workhuman - it’s their conference too. And of course there is another 100 Workhuman employees who contributed their energy and dedication that are not on this award - please reward them too! You all did an amazing job and WH19 was an unqualified success! The event was even more of a success than previous years, it seemed to have an extra level of energy that transcends what we have seen before. The energy, joy and inspiration experienced by the thousands of attendees will stay with them for a long time. This event lifts people like nothing else in the business world. A huge part of that is the Workhuman team, everywhere you look, helping and inspiring the attendees, and sharing in their enjoyment. We turned a cavernous empty space into something beautiful, and then filled it with energized humans. Our Workhuman speakers led the charge from the stage and our roster of external speakers combined to present a unified message. On top of all that we also had the launch of Workhuman Cloud for Teams, with hundreds of trials going live at the event - an unprecedented level of extra complexity - and opportunity! What an amazing success for all of us, well done to you all. My endless thanks to you and the teams that you lead. Another inspiring and energizing Workhuman in the books. Thank you!\n\n410#Workhuman Keynote|Jen and Jess, thank you so much for the work you did on the Workhuman Keynote! Over many months we toiled on this presentation and what we had this morning to present was a fantastic balancing act of strategic and entertaining content that covered the main business objectives whilst also giving some great food for thought to the attendees. Some of the feedback I have heard was a testament to the impact of some the incredible visuals. Jen, your eye for graphics and tone is amazing and it also fitted in seamlessly with everything else that was set up and designed at the conference. You can tell that the same team designed so much of the presentation as the conference surroundings! Kevin, special shout out for the Oceans 11 starter video! With incredible short notice you pulled that out of the bag and we ended up with an even better opening than we had before - Kudos! So, thanks team, another great success story!\n\n411#Executive walk-through Excellence|Jen and Ellen, I hope you feel an enormous amount of pride in what you have created together. Seeing it all come to life over the last 18 hours during our executive walk-throughs has been awe-inspiring. Your professionalism, competence and creativity is a joy to behold, especially as you explain your vision to our exec team. What a great way to start!\n\n412#Creative Genius|Jen – thank you for lending your creative genius to the customer events!  You have excelled at leading the creative charge in realizing the vision of bringing the Workhuman cloud to life at The Wildhorse.  Thank you for exceeding any expectations I could ever have had!  I am constantly in awe of your creativity!  You have a very special gift and that gift combined with your passion, vision and 100% alignment with what we are trying to do at Workhuman results in an incredible realization of our goals!  Thank you!  I love working with you and want you to know how much I appreciate you!  I am grateful that we can have open and honest conversations and I feel 100% comfortable giving you my unfiltered feedback and am grateful that you are always able to be understanding and provide the same right back to me!  Thank you for being an awesome partner and friend! Let’s get ready for some fun tomorrow night!!!  PS – I Just LOVE this pic!  Creativity IS intelligence having fun!!!!!\n\n413#A place for All The Things|Hi Jen, Thanks for putting on your worker-bee hat to crank out a notebook agenda for Nashville. Always down to the wire, this year was especially stressful as we tried to combine the notebook and agenda in one asset.  The notebook is a beautiful handout that our attendees love and look forward to each each. It has All The Things and they can add their own additional things. Thanks for stepping in when Lisa was buried.\n\n414#Always thinking of others|Jen, I wanted to thank you so much for the incredible ideas that you've been sharing the past few weeks about ways we can bring Nashville to our employees that aren't attending the conference. You had such fun ideas and Laury and I talked about them and are so psyched to be making some of them happen. Cotton candy on Tuesday with Hatch postcards helping explain the Nashville connection and hot chicken sandwiches on Thursday for lunch - all happening in both offices and we're mailing to the few remotes not coming to TN. Thanks so much for thinking about inclusivity and sharing the great ideas of things you've learned from your trips!\n\n415#Final Stages|Ladies, I have been extremely lucky enough to be called a part of this \"core\" team building out Workhuman Live 2019! You both need to take a moment and so extremely proud of your accomplishments leading up to right now. Jen, your vision, strength, experience, and leadership skills have exploded through everything you touch! You make everything you do looks so smooth and elite! Workhuman is blessed to have your eyes as the vision of this company. I hope you walk into Workhuman Live with a smile on your face because you deserve it all with all efforts and determination you bring everyday to work! Jill, leading lady of all things Workhuman Live! You pulled this rookie onto this team and have made me a better person because of the things I learn from you everyday. You show so much perception, well organized, driven, and are a true asset to this Workhuman Team. Your leadership shines throughout every aspect of each piece of this conference. You both work so well together as teammates because you trust each other and all your decisions are a group effort. I look forward to see this amazing conference shine more than any other year and you both should be extremely proud. Cheers ladies!\n\n416#Snow Queens|While the rest of us hunkered down at home during the snow storm, you braved it into the office and made sure the rest of the team had what they needed to keep moving remotely. Thanks!\n\n417#Working on a Holiday|Ladies!!!! Thank you so much for stepping in and helping us get everything out the door for the polos and the t-shirts for WorkHuman!!! We had a tight deadline and I needed answered and approvals for everything on one of the only holidays we get!!! You worked together and got everything approved and out the door yesterday! I can’t thank you enough!!!\n\n418#Ships in the night|The last few weeks have been crazy with all of the rebrand materials coming in and looming Workhuman \"the event\" deadlines. We may be \"ships passing in the night\" when it comes to actually seeing each other in the office, but I'm extremely grateful for all of your slack check ins and texts to make sure I'm staying on track with everything that needs to get done. You've jumped in to help whenever you're needed, created some stunning designs for WorkHuman, (and the rebrand!) and been extremely responsive on any changes, approvals, or discussions that need to happen to keep everything moving. Thank you!!!!\n\n419#Long weekend|= extra time to work on the event called Workhuman! Thank you for answering texts, Slacks and emails, and putting in hours over the long weekend to keep the work on track. Necessary and appreciated!\n\n420#Proofing, approving, tracking. & releasing|It was a very busy week with a lot of deadlines but we made it. Thank you to all of you who went multiple rounds to get it done right and on time.\n\n421#What's Not to Love About WH Flash Deals?|TEAM! A huge thank you and kudos to a job well done in regards to the WH flash deal. With Valentine's day near, we wanted to leverage a past promotion that performed well in market. Easy, right? Never! But that's what we love about WH!? Jen and Kevin, thank you so much for the collaboration, brainstorming and thinking out of the box to make this promotion BETTER than we originally thought. Lisa, thank you for your amazing dedication, not only this project, but ALL the WH design - you are such a star and SO responsive! Holly and Roshni, huge work on the executional details, getting into social, building communications for sales, and all with a huge and can-do smile! I feel privileged to be part of such a great team. Well done!\n\n422#Award Winning Content|Thank you for helping us produce such strong content for our GF20 General Session.  Your attention to detail and enthusiastic embrace of the vision we had for the event helped to create a seamless storyline.  Eric and Derek were able to deliver on our objectives with clarity and creativity.  Everything was beautiful, clean and frankly, mesmerizing.  We are lucky, and I am grateful to have your guys as part of the team delivering powerful live experiences.\n\n423#Storytelling Excellence!|Jen, Eric’s keynote was beautiful. I know it took a lot of work to craft a message this big, in a very simple visual way. And I love how it turned out. I also fully appreciate the fact that you saw how things were piling up on my side, and “volun-told” Lisa to jump in to help! Haha. Lisa, your quick work on the slides for Derek, gave me the bandwith to put out a few fires and get things back on track. They looked beautiful.\n\n424#Bringing a special workhuman moment to life!|Thank you all for your critical involvement in creating and delivering Eric's 20-year award!  We had several key requirements that were unique to this award including ensuring the secret was kept until the precise moment of celebration at the gala dinner!  Your excitement, passion and dedication to this unique and meaningful project was a joy to witness!  Jen thank you for your \"yes and\" collaboration to inspire the concept of a timeline award for Eric, Dan thank you for setting up the site and giving access to our workhuman family, Brian M thank you for setting up the site and applying the branding, Alana thank you for deigning the award, Maureen thank you for your design, approval and logistics management, Angela thank you for keeping all the deliverables on track, Matt thank you for securing the vanity URL, Colleen thank you for managing all employee communications and most importantly making sure Eric never got an alert message!!!  Lauren and Regan thank you for helping to get the board contributions, Eileen thank you for helping to gather the client contributions, Kevin thank you for your help with the messaging and Ellen thank you for being great stakeholder.  Amanda - you worked on this project with the most amazing amount of passion and determination and were a master coordinator of all things related to this project!  No challenge to tough to solve and no request to much work!  Your attitude was truly remarkable, AMAZING work and dedication to result in a special and powerful moment!  Brian K - AMAZING dedication and hard work to load all the employee awards into the private location along with all the family, customer and board messages!  Thank you for respecting the request for privacy and finding a great solution for us!  This team was amazing, and this was the most fulfilling workhuman project to get to work on!  Thank you!!!  Mission accomplished!  A great workhuman moment came to life because of you! Thank you!\n\n425#Picture perfect team!!|Thank you all so much for helping with such a fun photoshoot. This was something that I've only done on a very small scale before and you all made this such an easy process from start to finish. From helping with planning, to setting up all of the equipment and making a perfect seamless set up, to helping me style and arrange all of the products, adding in some lettering skills here and there - I couldn't have done it without y'all! Hopefully this is something we'll get to do more of in the future!\n\n426#\"Future Globoforce Intern\"|When I reached out about bringing in my Little from Big Brothers Big Sisters, each of you wrote back literally within minutes.. some seconds with a 'yesss!' Krystal loves the STEM program she is in and I thought it would be cool for her to see what a software company looks like and the wide range of opportunities there are. She had so much fun visiting and getting to peak behind the curtain at what each of you do. Before the visit I asked her what she imagined we would see... she said \"busy stressed people with computers.\" HA! After the visit, I asked what she thought and if there was anyone who stood out to her. She said \"I love it there. Every person that walked by smiled at us and said hi. The office was so colorful and had cool pictures and fun things to do and lots of food. I don't have a favorite, I loved Jen, Matt, Lauren and Laury!! I want to work there!\" I can't quote everything she said on the ride home but she chatted my ear off about each of you. It's so cool to know that this was the first time she's ever seen a place like this and she won't ever forget it. Who knows what might have inspired her or what she will become after talking to each of you. In six years, she could be your intern! :) Thank you for your time yesterday and having such a positive impact on Krystal! You are special people.\n\n427#Great team meeting last week!|Last week was quite busy and I was so impressed how you put together a concise presentation of work to share with each other at last week’s Creative Team meeting. As you took a few minutes to review where you are with your priorities, how things are going with client and project work, and some shared tips and tricks we can all do to help each other succeed, made the time productive and insightful. There was some thoughtful work shown and 2019 is looking mighty bright! Great work everyone!\n\n428#Working Human, Working Smart = Big Results!|Hey team, I wanted to acknowledge the great progress you have all made in just a few short weeks. From getting more data to better understanding registration sources and drivers, to launching an incredibly successful Cyber Monday campaign, it feels like every week the team gets savvier, more disciplined and more effective. You are a living demonstration of the power of \"working smart\" vs. just \"working hard\". I can't wait to see even more insights and intelligence as we continue to learn and optimize!\n\n429#Team Orange|Brian, you're probably the only one who will recognize this little guy, but I'm stealing him as our new mascot. (#ORANGE for life!) WorkHuman has been ramping up lately, with web deliverables, campaigns, and onsite hitting all at the same time. I wanted to take a minute to thank my amazing orange bucket (and web partners) for everything you've been doing to keep the glue together. Jen, you've jumped in to help - creating slides, making time to sit with me in person for creative approvals and revisions as quickly as possible, and tag teaming meetings so we can keep it moving. Dianne, you've been completely reorganizing our dashboards so that Workfront can work better for us and our workflow, and you're constantly finding ways to make the process better. Brian and Geoff, both of you have been crushing tight deadlines and new designs on workhuman.com - we're getting into a groove with new homepages, landing pages, and overdue web cleanup. So, thank you for being such an awesome team to work with and for always pushing forward!\n\n430#LinkedIn|I chose Urgency for this award but we couldn't have done it without a whole lot of respect for Teamwork. Thank you all for getting the LinkedIn package together in record time.\n\n431#Its take a village to pull off Cyber Monday!|WH Team!! Such good teamwork, hussle and creativity went into our Cyber Monday WorkHuman promotion. It literally took a village from design, web, ops, digital, third party, ops, content creation, registration and OH not to mention awesome leadership!!!! I'm thrilled with the results so far (over 100 registrants in a few days). Thanks so much to everyone involved who went the extra mile on this project, the results are a clear indicator of some good work and thoughtfulness. Let's get to the next milestone!!!!!!\n\n432#workhuman.com--wow!|Hey team, what a great effort to take the workhuman.com homepage to the next level! The challenge of the web site experience is to capture some of the amazing energy of our event and establish instant credibility that this is something not to be missed! With a good balance of inspiration and explanation, the web site will work so much harder to convert visitors and drive registration. You all gave it the care and attention required to do great work in short order, thank you!  We have some more work to do on interior pages, let's keep going!\n\n433#WorkHuman Wonder Women|Ladies, I just want to acknowledge all the work you're doing to make sure the marketing/creative side of WH 2019 continues to run smoothly. It's not an easy job, but the three of you are managing it with efficiency, grace, thoughtfulness, creativity, and humor - as always. You rock!\n\n434#Tiger teaming it!|Jen- you are one of the OG tigers and the way you speak to the work we’ve been doing on the Agency Workflow is perfection. You put in so many hours uncovering Globoforce’s pain points and addressing what it would take to make the process of working together so much more efficient. You had an epiphany along the way that opened our eyes to some of the gray areas that needed attention! You created slides to present information clearly in our team meetings. If something isn’t working, you’re always quick to come up with a solution. Thanks for all of your invaluable feedback, creativity and thoughtful ideas along the way! I also have to mention it wasn’t an easy time to focus as you were the only creative director at the time, managing the majority of the designers and being in the know on all of their projects. Great work juggling everything!\n\n435#Outstanding Creativity!|A huge thank you to the team for your assistance with the recent BT & BA finalist presentations. An enormous amount of work went into the planning, design and delivery of all the branded assets and sites we presented to both clients. The inflight magazine that you created for BA was a stroke of genius and very well received by the BA team - they were extremely appreciative of all the effort you went to - they loved the Rise demo branding too by the way! So much so that I've been invited back in for a one to one demo session with the exec sponsor...many thanks for helping to open that door for us and for making us look great!\n\n436#Marketing Leadership at Work!|Big Team - thank you for all the hard work and homework you put into preparing for the Marketing Offsite. It took weeks of prep, but we plowed through the entire organizational plan AND gave ourselves space for some extraordinarily creative and transformational thinking (who doesn't love THAT? ;-) Thank you for bringing your whole selves and giving your colleagues the gift of your undivided attention. Thank you for your leadership, candor and trust, and thank you for your DECADES AND DECADES of experience, put to work! :-)  As we all know, the real hard work starts now to get us to coherent and aligned 2019 plans, executing against those plans and tackling the big projects we identified. I am so proud to be a part of this team, and I meant what I said: I have NEVER worked with a more engaged group of people in my entire career. I am so excited about what we will accomplish together, and how we will contribute to accelerating Eric's thrilling vision for our company!\n\n437#Office 365 Branding|Thank you for the Support and guidance and the actual work of completing the Branding exercise for the Office 365 platform.  As soon as I put in my request I had a team of people put into action asking questions, gathering ideas and in no time at all it was completed.  the speed  and quality that you work at is above and beyond my expectations.\n\n438#Executive Forums: The behind the scenes dream team|From emails and landing pages, to agendas and name plates, to shipping and room blocks, I could not have pulled off all of the necessary logistics and communications to host 3 executive events in 2 weeks. Your attention to detail coupled with your willingness to be flexible, allowed me to pull together a program that met the needs of attendees as well as our own executives. You helped make my job easier and the forums a success. Thank you!\n\n439#A Week of Tag|This was a week of tag. You were tagged to revise a file, find a file, build a thing, hackamajig - to cover for teammates who were out and/or last minute changes to plans. Thank you for stepping in and stepping up when the fire bell rang. I am very grateful for teammates who understand it is part of the world we work in and want to say - Cheers to you!\n\n440#WorkHuman 2019 success!|Jen, Jill, thank you very much for reaching out and taking the initiative to gather input from the sales leadership team regarding specific ways we can drive WH'19 pipeline results. Among many goals, two are certainly to move more prospects into the pipeline and progress more opportunities into the \"closed won\" column. The exercise brought some interesting ideas and strategies to enhance the likelihood of success. It was a great example of teamwork, collaboration and focus. We are more than happy to help with the execution of these ideas. Thanks again!\n\n441#Breaking new ground|A huge thank you to the team as we complete and roll out a new set of product sheets for the sales team. We've re-thought the approach, really paid attention to the message hierarchy and flow, and the result is a harder working, more impactful and engaging piece. Z, your leadership on this project and commitment to quality were both remarkable. With a focus on the use cases and our differentiators in the market, you made sure that proof points and our customers were front and center and that we highlighted the unique value we deliver. Eric, your advocacy for Conversations continues, and was a really important contribution on that front. Jen, in a single working session you worked your magic, creating a design solution that gave the piece a new energy withTyler following on to make sure it all worked and came together for launch. This new template will serve us well going forward so bravo to all!\n\n442#Wonderful first impressions|I'd like to thank each of you for making the first two weeks of my time at Globoforce a wonderful experience. I'm so thrilled to be working with such a talented and motivated team! I've had insightful conversations, productive learning sessions, and rewarding moments getting to know you each as the wonderful humans you are. What a way to begin this journey! I'm very much looking forward to supporting you all in your roles. Thank you!\n\n443#Pivot to present in hours|Taking a minute to recognize my teammates on the Agency Workflow priority. Monday afternoon we had to pivot and rework our presentation with a tight deadline. This team jumped on Slack to sort out how to divide and conquer and put our best message together. I doubt anyone in the room felt it wasn't a presentation that had weeks of time against it. It was simple yet complete, and elicited solid feedback. Way to be responsive, team!\n\n444#Thanks for the hustle!|Jenn, the ppt deck project came at us fast and furious, but you were there to catch it! Thank you for keeping an eye on one of our key priorities and bringing it home on time! Now, for the next round... :-)\n\n445#GFWN - Recruiting Subcommittee FTW!|Thank you so much for participating in the *first* recruiting subcommittee meeting of the GFWN! It was a fantastic kick off meeting and everyone brought so many amazing ideas to the table. I'm so excited to see where this leads and look forward to bringing our ideas to the larger group. Thank you for your time, interest and excitement!\n\n446#Workin' the Workflow|This is long overdue but I wanted to recognize you for your commitment to making our team better,  not only because improving the workflow is a business objective we need to scale, but because you really care. In the short time since we've all been together as an IHA, you have taken on the daunting challenge of meeting, reviewing, walking clients through, documenting and really coming to the table with potential solutions for success. It's a mountain we are climbing step-by-step and you are so close to the top of the peak, I am so proud of the work you've achieved and the successes along the way. I truly appreciate it.\n\n447#RAP’ing like Champs…|Team, cannot thank you enough for all your hard work around the re-architecting pay (RAP) campaign. This is a tricky concept, but all have done an amazing job rallying to challenge ourselves to come up with awesome images and effective copy. Thank you for the patience while we get this campaign off the ground, it's no small feat! Excited to share results and I have no doubt this campaign will impact the business in a meaningful way.\n\n448#Data + Creative = Genius|A major thank you to all of you for bringing your genius to the table to help create a spectacular investment story and make it jump off the page.  After a few calls with some 'framework' that I'd scrambled together, each of you got to work thinking about how we could make a connections story come to life.  Something that would compel customers to think about the investment level they make in terms of the actual connections they are creating AND then show them how a greater investment exponentially multiples those connections.  We've already used our creation with two major customers to rave reviews. I cannot even imagine how compelling our next iteration will be! Thank you so much for your teamwork, your partnership, your urgency, and for all of your creative genius!   Bravo!\n\n449#It takes a village|Thank you to everyone who contributed to the submission of our IHAF awards this year. Each of you jumped in to contribute, providing project descriptions, design files, performance statistics, helping to track down old video links, and overall making sure we were putting our best foot forward. Holly, you spent extra time walking me through all the workhuman campaigns from 2017 and into 2018 so we could get a big picture view of what was working (and not working) which will in turn influence how we approach the creative moving into this year. Angela, you were my partner in crime for the whole project - contacting print vendors, managing timelines, and putting together the final shipped submission. Thanks to everyone for making this a full marketing team effort. I can't wait to see how it goes!\n\n450#Taking care of business|Jen, thank you so much for jumping on a few of my projects while I was out sick yesterday. It helped everything keep moving forward on our client's timelines. I appreciate all of your help!\n\n451#WorkHuman Crazy Pants|Thanks to each of you for contributing to an entertaining WorkHuman promo. What better way to create a price hike sense of urgency than to get on the airwaves of WorkHuman Radio. From a well-written blog post, to the affable WorkHuman Radio host, to the creative director with all of the colorful stories – you make Nashville the place to be in March. Great teamwork, excellent quality. Well done!\n\n452#WH War Room|Thanks for setting up the war room for Workhuman this week! I think it's really going to help us moving forward having a place to visualize and see how the entire thing will come to life.\n\n453#Images and content for the FastCo Design Award|Thank you for pulling together images, brainstorming content and providing descriptions for WH Central activations in a timely manner. This info is super helpful and will have us craft a compelling entry. Really appreciate your collaboration on this.\n\n454#Meaningful Meeting|Thank you for providing valuable feedback, thoughtful insights and strategic solutions as we debriefed on the WorkHuman Executive Forum and discussed the needs for this audience and C-level involvement moving forward. Your honest input and positive outlook helped to align our thinking as we move into planning for 2019. Leadership is a key theme as we prepare for WorkHuman and is was a key quality exemplified in today's meeting!\n\n455#Nashville here we go!|A huge thank you to both of you for jumping in with input and direction for the new Nashville branding. Jen, we're totally on the same brainwave lately with all the new Nashville stuff, and you've been powerhousing and pushing out email after email and banner after banner to get this thing ready to show. Dan, we asked you for some direction on where WorkHuman is going this year in terms of content and you took the time to add mood words, a new mission statement, content tracks and more to our initial deck so we could get off and running. It has been absolutely awesome to see how the two of you approach all the different aspects of this event - I can't wait to see where Nashville ends up!\n\n456#Interview Extraordinaires!|Team - thank you so so so much for taking the time to interview yesterday's candidate.  She had such positive feedback on her interview experience here - and I have all of you to thankfor that!  Creating a strong, positive, and fun candidate experience is so important in attracting top talent and setting us apart from other organizations that are / will be hiring.  Also, I am so impressed with the level/quality of feedback that each of you brought to the debrief.  It is clear that you all asked really great questions, and we able to answer her questions effectively and enthusiastically.  Amazing work, team!\n\n457#GloboHuman and all that|You have been an amazing GloboHuman to work with on that liiiiiiiittle event we just pulled off. Over the past year, all the details big and small. Activations, words, colors, textures, textiles, all the senses and the experience were amazing. It's actually quite difficult to put into words how great it's been working with you and I can't wait for the many more WorkHumans and what you will create for the humans of the WORLD. #workinghumanworlddomination\n\n458#Great Fireflies|As I recover from and reflect upon WorkHuman 2018, I am grateful for our partnership with Sparks. This year was bigger and better than ever, which meant more things to create, produce, worry about. While it was physically more demanding (oiy, the bookstore and concrete floors!) it was also less stressful than previous years in the weeks leading up to Austin. That is because we have a super relationship with Sparks. The many weekly meetings and open lines of communication built a foundation for creativity to shine and it assets were managed down to the last approval. I want to recognize you for building this trusted partnership with a solid vendor that can support us in propelling WorkHuman into the future. Cheers!\n\n459#WorkHuman Keynote!|Kyle, Jen and Amanda, Thank you so much for all your help on my keynote! It was a great team effort (although Kyle, you did jack shit) :-). Seriously, thanks you all so much, it takes months of work and real talent to create something that can kick off the world's major HR and work conference! Many meetings over many months, real creativity and patience with the process, creates something special, even if the specialness is being changed 10 times a day right up to stage time! It was a pleasure to work with you. And Kevin, we couldn’t have done it without you!\n\n460#WorkHuman Creative Genius!|Jen & Jess - you guys really are the dynamic duo!  It has been a phenomenal experience personally to work so closely with you guys this year through vendor selection, idea formation, on-sites and then final execution!  You guys are a modern marvel!!!  How you managed to take a big grey box and turn it into a vibrant yet cozy and intimate local experience was just genius!  You have created an exceptional team and provided phenomenal leadership to them all to create together this amazing experience!  As Darlene at Corning shared - so many customers commented on the fact that they loved experiencing Austin without even leaving the building - your ability to incorporate the local environment into the entire experience was incredible and so many shared that the open floorplan and main stage set up was so powerful yet felt so intimate, not at all as if there were 2700 people in the space!  Thank you also for so much care and attention helping us execute our vision for the customer experiences.  Working together we were able to create a cohesive experience for our customers across the entire event!  I love working with you guys - you inspire me and show me what great looks like every day!  Looking forward to starting 2019 planning - like tomorrow!!!!  Thank you both!\n\n461#Not All Heroes Wear Capes|The week before WorkHuman is always crazy - but this week takes the cake. One of our activations was experiencing some serious technical difficulties, and all of you dropped what you were doing to jump in and make sure we could make it the best it could be. Matt - I can't thank you enough for sitting down with me all morning to design charts and graphs in excel and test their connectivity with PowerPoint. Mark - you came out of nowhere and saved the day with sharepoint magic and a new approach to the survey. Brian & Jen - when we realized our initial solution was a no-go, both of you were quick to offer new ideas and start testing so that we could find the best solution in the least amount of time. And Lee! You jumped up from what you were doing to help us figure out what was causing the disconnect between our local drafts and the live updates. I am SO thankful that we have such an amazing team that was able to take this and run so that our attendees (and our customer!) will have a good experience onsite next week in Austin. THANK YOU!!!!!! You're all amazing.\n\n462#Ain't nobody gonna dull my sparkle|This tiny team was a true power house for a very important WorkHuman project. You each played an integral role in delivering an AH-mazing asset that is going to warm the hearts of all our customers while delivering business objectives that make our GF Team proud! Dianne - keeping us all on task during the hardest two weeks before the conference is near impossible sometimes and without you, it wouldn't have been done. Amanda - researching, reporting, pulling every single client name from our records in every category so we represented true data... this was where it all started!! Jen - creating a GORGEOUS ombre template out of no where and building a theme to let our clients shine while also sharing our business case in quirky/fun messaging... does your brain ever run out of ideas? Kristen - using a magnifying glass to comb through every teeny detail on every single slide getting us to perfection! Formatting and wordsmithing us to a final product... seriously, the patience of a saint! Thank you all for sharing your talents. I am so excited for this to be shown at WorkHuman!!!!\n\n463#The Greatest Selfie I've Ever Seen|This is a huge shout out of thanks to our creative and marketing teams who have once again gone above and beyond to deliver for the sales team.  The new master slide deck is a MASTERPIECE!  When the project started, the list of requirements seemed insurmountable and started with create a new category and position Globoforce as the king of that category.  And, there in, was the first challenge.  What category? Add to that challenge, the evolution of Globoforce’s solution.  Add to that a new sales approach.  Add to that a new design. Add to that the desire of sales to be in a demo within 15 minutes of a 1 hour meeting.  And, the list goes on.  Frankly, I’m shocked at how easy you all made this look because I saw how hard everyone was working to make this approach come to life.  The new market position of Human Applications, our WorkHuman Cloud, the elegant and streamlined design, and the overall sales approach will allow Globoforce to change the playing field on our competitors and serve our Company well into the future.  My sincerest THANKS and biggest High 5’s to each and every one for your contributions to the new master deck.  My only remaining question is: I wonder what’s on Eric’s phone that has everyone leaning in and smiling in the above picture? HA!\n\n464#A whisper of thanks|Sometimes you see a creative effort that just blows you away-- and I saw that last week with an experience for our WorkHuman audience that is just so good, resonates on so many levels and will absolutely set the stage for an amazing event. Wow! Can't share the details just yet, but I know the coaching, feedback and advice that made this come to life in a perfect kind of way. Thank you for that, so lucky to work with you all!\n\n465#Weaving the mainstage stories|Jen - I have to give you HUGE props for the amazing work you've been doing for all things mainstage. For Eric's keynote, it has been amazing to see the storyline come together - a beautiful mix of humanity intertwined with product. It is so hard to find the right balance, and you've managed to ensure there is a captivating (and visually GORGEOUS) story to share. I'm also thrilled to be working with you again on Derek's mainstage presentations - those visuals came together so quickly and are beautiful simplicity. Not to mention the WH all-star band - which is another great story that I'm so sorry to be missing. I know there are so many other pieces to the WorkHuman experience that you touch and your mind must be racing - but you would never know! Incredible innovation, imagination and determination! Almost there :)\n\n466#Master deck creative mastery|Hi ladies. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your help leveling up the creativity, brand consistency, and overall flow for the master sales deck. As you know, it wasn't an easy project to tackle for many different reasons but right around Ignite, we were able to turn a corner when you two became more intimately involved. Now we're finally about to roll out all the new slides to the organization and so far, I'm getting great feedback from Sales, Research and other teams too. I genuinely appreciate your creative direction and I am very proud of what we've developed together. THANK YOU AGAIN!\n\n467#A Win and an In for LinkedIn at WH|Amanda, Jill, and Jen -  I wanted to both congratulate and thank you for the tremendous work you all did on the LinkedIn sponsorship for WorkHuman.  In a very short amount of time, you crafted and build a phenomenal package and activation that not only met LinkedIn’s goals – but also our own.  You were agile, quick thinking, and also thought big.  The end result will be a perfect, complementary component of WorkHuman Central that gives attendees something to interact with (learning and having fun at the same time).  It brings the entire community closer.  To top it off, this will enhance our relationship with LinkedIn, who is already a great customer partner.  Well done!\n\n468#The Touch of Human Pen|Jen - thanks for lending a helping hand - literally - to personalize our Visionary Council invitations to WorkHuman with your amazing penmanship. Your time, effort and dedication to hand write each individual's name in calligraphy carried out our human theme and made the invitations that much more personal and effective. The Visionary Council is shaping up to be an amazing group of leaders thanks to your help!\n\n469#Buuuuuddddy!|Jen, thanks for being such an amazing buddy over the last month! You have been so knowledgeable on any questions (and I’ve had a lot!), bouncing ideas and just have been overall friendly, welcoming and just flat out amazing! Thanks for inspiring me to be a buddy to a newbie in the future!\n\n470#56 Day Countdown|Flying home from Austin, I could not help but think that the next time I was on this flight, I would be returning from WH18. I also feel so thankful to work with people who are so dedicated to making this a fantastic event.  We got so much accomplished in our short 24 hours. Everyone showed up with their goals and priorities for the visit and set out to make sure they were accomplished. You have all been so great to work with during the planning of WH18 and we are now a giant step further and heading into the home stretch.\n\n471#Always making time for feedback!|Jen, I am so appreciative of all the thorough feedback you've been providing on projects here in the office while on a busy site visit in Austin! The WH Valentine's Day infographic email has a lot of pieces that need reviewing and with Valentine's Day approaching quickly you were so helpful and responsive with not 1, not 2 but about 7 rounds of reviews! Thank you so much for all of your help :)\n\n472#Pitch Perfect|Each of you were nominated by your Session breakout teams to deliver the final pitch to compete for the winning idea of how to get a Sr. Exec's attention and wow did you deliver! Your individual ideas were awesome, and I loved  the focus and dedication you put into making the pitch. A true demonstration of how great innovation comes out of imagination and determination. Thanks for stepping up and delivering the pitch! ~ Jen & Rob\n\n473#Calming those first program jitters!|Thanks so much to an amazing creative team for your support on my first demand campaign, focused around the SHRM report. You were both so amazing throughout the creative process, with awesome ideas and impressive follow through, not to mention collaboration! I greatly appreciate the support and patience, you are all rockstars!!!\n\n474#If it weren't for you................|If it weren't for the two of you creative and talented superstars, Sunday would not have been possible. It felt like a marathon right? Exhausting yet exciting that such amazing-ness was accomplished under the odds! It was touch and go all week, are we doing this... are we not? You both showed the energy and excitement we needed and encouragement that YES we could do it and we would! Our Insight Team and CSM's turned into movie stars! The boomerangs were creative and at the same time, hysterical! Special shout out to Jen's husband! (Is that allowed?! haha!). Fantastic job to both of you!!!! I cannot wait to see what becomes of the amazing footage. I know our customers will absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!\n\n475#Joy personified|Jen - Little did I know that when I asked you how it was to work at Globoforce back in the summer, that I’d actually end up here alongside you - but boy am I thankful that I did. And I feel lucky and amped whenever I get to collaborate with you because brainstorming with your kind of perspective and creativity is what lights me up. You’re a breath of fresh air, wildly talented, truly kind, and I think you embody everything that Globoforce is about - humanity, loving what you do, and joy. Here’s to many many more collaborations!\n\n476#Ignite 2018 Keynote|Jen, Amanda and Kevin, Thank you so much for all your help and work on my keynote presentation at Ignite. It went down very well but took a lot of hard work over many  months! You guys did a fantastic job and I thought we worked together as a team extremely well. It's exciting to see stuff like this coming together, innovation sometimes doesn’t conform to our schedules and must be nurtured to grow - you guys are always so understanding of the process and contribute so much great content along the way - even though you have to suffer a stressful end every time! Thank you so much. Another one under our belts!\n\n477#Shiny Beautiful|Jen - Thank you so much for your partnership leading up to Ignite. Everything came together so quickly and so beautifully! I love seeing how your creative brings content to life. I think we have a great foundation for WorkHuman. Amazing work as always!\n\n478#Can I borrow your brain for 5 minutes?|Jen, thanks for putting your brain into illustrator-mode yesterday as I was working on The Big Picture project. Even though we only shared ideas  and possibilities and scribbled on paper for about 5 minutes, it really helped me get to the finish line. I know you're busy juggling other tasks but you always find the time to give thoughtful and constructive critiques of my work, and it doesn't go unnoticed or unappreciated!\n\n479#Video Brief!|Thank you so much Jen for helping me with the WH awards video brief! You did an amazing job and gave me a huge head start to deliver over to Sparks. I know I can count on you for anything (not just your creativity!!). You are a team player always. Thank you so much!!!\n\n480#WorkHuman Central Sensations|J&J - Super awesome work on WorkHuman Central for WorkHuman 2018.  You have put so much care, thought, creativity, and agility into creating a plan and design around the experience at next year's show.  Every year has its challenges are the start - and this year is surely no different.  But you step up and create something beautiful - something that fits our brand, evolves WorkHuman, and has that \"wow\" factor for attendees.  Thank you for all of your leadership.  There will be no photo attached to this award - as WorkHuman Central will be a great surprise for all attendees - internal and external.  Can't wait to see it live and in person in April!\n\n481#Sharing the energy|Creative team - thank you for presenting at the marketing team meeting last Monday -sharing key take-aways from your recent IHAF offsite. You were clearly inspired by it and I want to recognize you for the time you put into the presentation and bringing it back to the larger team. Cheers!\n\n482#This ad has an agenda|Thank you for sitting down with me to walk through a WorkHuman ad this week. You talked through how you felt it would be most effective, and worked with me to make decisions on placement and hierarchy so that we could move the ad through approvals quickly under a tight deadline. It was great to get a fresh perspective and work collaboratively on this. Thanks!\n\n483#Activating our brand awareness!|Coming back from the brand conference we were all so energized that we couldn’t stop talking about it for days. And while we were there all we wanted to do was to be sure we could share everything that we were hearing and learning with our fellow marketers. I was so proud of our team as we gathered together to debrief, consolidate our notes and our learnings, and then present to the entire marketing organization this week. I have heard people even quoting some of our quotes in meetings and I think people learned a lot from our ‘panel’. Being such thoughtful designers, seeing the bigger picture and then sharing makes us all better.\n\n484#Who wouldn't want to come work with us!?|Thank you to this great team of people who wrote the copy, designed the ad, kept us on track, gave great feedback, incorporated that feedback, and to the subjects of our photo who so graciously and quickly agreed to be included, thank you! We often hear that sales is a team sport, and you know what else is? Recruitment advertising! Creating a great ad to draw people in when they're looking at The Boston Globe's Sunday Magazine on Nov 19 is no simple feat! Thanks to everyone involved for the role you played in getting this off to print and for helping raise awareness of Globoforce as a top place to work. Well done!\n\n485#Amazing Talent, Passionate Partner|Jen - this recognition is long overdue. I've lost track of the number of meetings we've been in together, where you articulate innovative concepts that move us forward. Your love of brand building, quality creative and content, and kick-ass execution keep us in overdrive and cranked up to \"11.\"  I could not have a better \"partner\" to jam with on the synergies of content and creative. You should be proud of the quality work you're doing, and I know that you help me raise my game just by being in the room.  I can't wait to bring our next set of ideas to life. Thanks for all you do.\n\n486#'It's all happening!'|Walking out of that fantastic presentation, all I could think of one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite movies of all time, 'It's all happening!' - Almost Famous. You four put together GREAT out-of-the-box ideas that wowed Janet, Kevin and I. Ideas that we are excited to immediately put into production and get out to market! When there are limited boundaries, you all really shine. We can't wait to see it all in action.\n\n487#Marketing to the rescue!|You guys were incredibly nimble in responding to our cries for help in preparing the Dell business case visuals!  The quality and swiftness of your work allowed us to provide the Dell SVPs options from which to choose.  They loved your work and it made Globoforce shine!  Thank you so much for placing Dell at the top of your list for this very strategic meeting.  Just think, your work will be presented directly to Michael Dell.\n\n488#Picking up what we're putting down|Jen, thank you for being such a great project partner in the past few weeks. From spot illustrations to web designs, you were picking up what I was putting down. (and vice versa!) As a team, we have been able to complete projects that individually could have taken days and reduced the project time to a matter of hours. Thank you!!\n\n489#WorkHuman Roadshow|Rebecca, Alice, Dan and Jenn, Thank you for all the preparation for bringing and inspiring WorkHuman for the customer success team. Alice, you are such a \"champion\" for your team and together with Rebecca and the CSMs, you are strong advocates for our customers. Dan and Jenn, thank you again for another engaging presentation, putting together CS specific content, supporting me in my first presentation and igniting the kick-off's. Here's to the next roadshow!\n\n490#Fresh and so clean clean|Team- From the very beginning everyone was a bit skeptical about refreshing our fabulous Hello-box, however the new design is so fresh and so clean! The work that went into this from the design, vendor updates, spec and pricing, meetings and reviews was endless. Every time we thought we had covered everything something else was thought of...a sign of true collaboration! So incredibly excited about all the new design and the additional offerings available to our stakeholders!!\n\n491#Making an IMPACT|Thank you all SO much for each of your efforts over the last few weeks as we sent various urgent requests your way to help us prepare for the GE onsites. A completely branded demo site in two days, multiple visuals for the GE redemption experience and various edit cycles.  On top of already full work loads, you each went above and beyond to make sure you were able to deliver what we needed and in the time frame we needed it. Your contributions helped us showcase to GE the possibilities of what their program and employee experience can look like in 2018!\n\n492#OOO Calendar|Thank you for using the OOO calendar so Angela and I are equipped to schedule meetings and deadlines. It is a small task that makes a big difference in managing your projects; we appreciate it!\n\n493#Coach Jen!|It hasn't been long since you've taken on being the front line reviewer of all the work that team creative has been producing, but you've really risen to the occasion. You always make time to review my projects, despite always having a fully booked calendar, and never do you make me feel like I don't have your full focus on my project. The feedback you give is thoughtful and really strikes the balance where I'm understanding your suggestions and learning from your guidance, and not ever feeling like you're just marking errors with a red pen. Thank you for being a great coach and teammate!\n\n494#Creative sparks!|It was so terrific to watch you both lead a creative process at the WorkHuman Austin kickoff last week, imagining so many levels of a customer experience as we walked around an empty convention hall. Your energy and passion are contagious! We accomplished so much in a couple of days as a team, and having seen your creative magic before, I so look forward to partnering with you both on WorkHuman 2018. A great start!\n\n495#Director status!|First of all, Thank you for coming in on your days off to help direct the cast in the Conversations video shoot! Fridays were the only day we could make some of the schedules work and you were totally understanding and on board to make it work. You have been doing an amazing job as the Director! You prepared a wardrobe and prop list and helped set the stage for each scene. You took the time to walk the makeup artist through how everyone should look. You slowly fed the cast direction on how to move, how to act, how to make this whole thing flow perfectly. I can't wait to see all of your work come to life!\n\n496#A little to the left....perfect!|Jenn Perr, I want everyone to how grateful I am for all your help in planning for the Conversations video shoot.  Your artistic vision and design skills are incredible and much appreciated.  And you came in on a Friday to help with our shoot.  Above and beyond.  Thank you so much and I can't wait to make more great art with you.\n\n497#QBR Help - Amazing Agenda Design|Jen - thank you so much for the effort you put into making team Brevin's agenda slide pop during our recent QBR.  You went above and beyond your normal work schedule to ensure that our presentation had the Shock and Awe value we were looking for in regards to Captain Agenda.  A fellow gardener I understand as do you that many times you have to nurture and care for something before it will really sprout.  Setting time aside during your busy personal schedule is much appreciated.  Thanks again for helping the east team to honor their boss!\n\n498#On it!|Thank you for jumping in to quickly make a correction to the WH group rates messaging today to get it in front of Sales ASAP! Appreciate the quick help.\n\n499#Timely GE Visuals|Thank you so much for quickly turning around a request from our biggest customer to help them better visualize the best that we have to offer.  This will be directly used to help them illustrate how Globoforce fits into their vision of the future with GE executives.  Not only was the quality excellent but the speed of turnaround meant we could exceed expectations on delivery.  I realize that you're not sitting around waiting for something to do and had to find a way to fit this into your busy schedule.  It is really appreciated and it really makes a difference to both our customer and our business.  Thank you!!\n\n500#The buddy system|Your help in on boarding the newest members of our team is invaluable. When you speak about us and our brand, our team, our message, you are so enthusiastic and insightful it makes people feel energized and excited to dive right in. Thanks for being such a positive influence on the team and making us all smile a little more everyday.\n\n501#A great meet and greet!|I wanted to say thank you to all the members of the marketing team for our lunch meet and greet over in Boston. It was great getting to know a little bit about all of your backgrounds and the sort of work that you all contribute to Globoforce. We spoke about improving our collaborations where possible/appropriate in the coming months. I hope that you are as excited by this as we are. You were all very welcoming to my team and I sincerely appreciated it. I only hope that we can extend the same courtesy when you are in Dublin next! A big thank you to all!\n\n502#PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT|Your mockups of the concept of GE redemption experiences was PERFECT.  The client reacted by saying \"that is exactly what we were thinking of...you captured the concept perfectly!\"  Jen, your color tone and images were PERFECT.  I spent only 5 minutes discussing this work with you.  But, I knew when I got your email later in the day that the mockups would be exactly what I needed (as all your work is).  However, when I saw them, I had only one word in my email response to you.  PERFECT!  Thanks!  This was important to build a stronger relationship with our largest client!\n\n503#Creative Connections|A very belated thank you for connecting us with your contact at Delin Designs, who (no surprise based on the quality of your own work) has not only been great to work with, but most important has really delivered for us and one of our newest \"mega customers.\"  Thank you again!\n\n504#Creative minds on the fly!!|Jen, Jess and Dianne - I cannot thank you enough for your willingness to jump in and help with the custom coasters and t-shirt designs for Whirlpool's upcoming Get gNARly event. To say that we are in a time crunch would be a huge understatement but thanks to your quick thinking, creative designs and ability to efficiently and effectively collaborate as a team I am confident we will be able to deliver!   Thanks again for being amazing!\n\n505#Don't shoot the messenger!|There's a lot of work to be done post WorkHuman and you've been somehow handling it all without a break in between. Thank you for not shooting the messenger every time I assign you to a new job and they've been stacking up in your queue. I appreciate the fact that you're still able to deliver designs that are on point with little errors. I've seen lots of proofs bouncing around and lots of happy responses from the project owners. Keep up the good work!!\n\n506#The Action Behind the Action Plan|Team - Amazing teamwork on the WorkHuman action plan campaign!!! And yes, it deserves multiple exclamation points :). Dan, you worked tirelessly on the content and produced a great asset that will help our prospects take real steps to creating more human workplaces. Jen and Lisa, your impactful designs brought it all to life! Holly and Anthony, you patiently and calmly manage the lists, schedule, tests, and edits under an extremely tight deadline. And Stacey, I think the entire marketing area will agree that you were determined to get this done on time - thank you for leading the charge on this. You guys rock!\n\n507#Masters of Content!|Jen and Amanda it would be very hard indeed to think of a better team to work alongside for Work Human content/ speaking guides & presentations.   From the outset you came to our content meetings with lots of ideas, fresh and passionate, knowing exactly the type of feeling you had in mind for our audience.   This you followed through into great slides, notes, and on-the-day guidance in order to ensure that the right content was hitting the right spots at the right time.   It was a pleasure to work with you both on the content for my sessions at Work Human.  You made it easy for me!   Many thanks for your team work, passion, attention to every detail and being such a great support.  Congratulations on creating a truly great conference & experience!\n\n508#ROYGBIV|I really don't know how we are going to top WorkHuman next year! The rainbow of greatness you created this year in WorkHuman central was just stunning. Moving from the earthy reds, to the bright yellows and greens of the trees (oh the real trees!), the amazing blues of Globoforce all the way to vibrant purples. Like the Skittles commercial, I hope it's contagious!\n\n509#WorkHuman Keynote|Thank you so much for all the work that you guys (especially you Jen!) did on my keynote for WorkHuman. WorkHuman was an unqualified success! The keynote is a big part of the business deliverable for the conference, and having the keynote on the last day was an added twist! The work we did to get CHROs to that session paid off - we got important messaging to key, influential people. I had multiple CHROs come up to me after and express excitement about what they learned.   The keynote itself was only possible with the many meetings and creative work we did. It looked and sounded great. I think we nailed the $5000 concept!   More than all that, it was a pleasure working with you all and all of those meetings were a joy. Its great to work with creative, positive, talented people! Thank you!\n\n510#Gratitude Goodness|Amazing work on the Gratitude Bar at WorkHuman and way you have presented the concept at multiple stages along the way. Your passion for this project has been so evident throughout - and it shows within every detail (from functionality to imagery).  This experience is going to be phenomenal for attendees and lift WorkHuman and its connection to social recognition to a whole new level.  Thank you for all of your efforts and ideas to make it a reality!\n\n511#So many eyes|Over the past week you've been buried in proofs for notebooks and signs and more. So. Many. Proofs. We're not quite done yet, but 'almost there' feels like the time to share my appreciation for all your time, patience, not running away when you see me chasing you down.... Thank you for using the tool, adapting to it, learning on the fly. I can't wait to see everything printed and enjoyed by all attendees, and to share the group exhale with you! Thank you, teammates.\n\n512#Up and Moving|Thank you ladies for keeping this up and running on the notebook while I was out on vacation. Dianne, the relationship you've maintained with D3 has helped push the quality of our assets to the next level. Deanna is such a great partner to have, and I thank you for that because you are the sole person in constant contact with them! You have the tough conversations when it comes to pricing, and more importantly deadlines, and then making them aware of all our proofs we need to send to them. Jen, you helped keep the layout in progress while content was still piling in, and came to work to work on it on one of your days off. It needed to keep moving, and you were able to pick up and run with it! Thank you for having my back ladies!\n\n513#Amazing Jen!|Thank you Jen for your incredible passion, determination and unmatched creative genius!  It has been, as always, such a pleasure to work with you on the customer experience at WorkHuman!  You bring such deep thought to every conversation and I truly feel like we accomplish so much so efficiently during our sessions!  Thank you for being such a critical and invaluable partner!  I love working with you and am constantly amazed by your creativity and contributions!  Thank you!!!\n\n514#Keeping the Lights ON!|When 60% of your team is traveling for work at the same time, someone has to keep the design happening, the wheels turning, the plates spinning. Thank you for being available, putting forth extra effort and time. At some point (hopefully soon)... we'll be able to exhale. We have a long few weeks ahead but it is critical to keep the work moving. Thank you for that!\n\n515#Customer Awards|Thanks ladies for all your help on getting these Customer Awards approved and out the door for production! We were down to the wire and you all were hands on deck to get these done! Looking forward to seeing them in person and shine them up for the Customers! Thanks again for your hard work!\n\n516#Got USB?|Thank you so much for your speedy help with finding out if there was a video on my USB drive... on your PERSONAL computer and with your jacket, on ready to leave!! I really appreciate your help with no resources available to me and a super tight deadline to meet. You rock!\n\n517#WorkHuman Announcement Engine|The journey to publicly announce WorkHuman keynotes is a winding road of twists and turns. Stops and starts. Hidden cliffs and long straight drives to the end.  There are so many parts that play into a successful launch - and making everything look and sound great internally and externally and getting the wide world ready to embrace the share news, updates, and more.  Thank you to all of you of your continued fantastic work, patience, attitude, and diligence in making this year's WorkHuman line-up a sure-fire promo hit!\n\n518#Wow - Look at WorkHuman Coming Together|I am blown away by the preparation and creative deliverables in the WorkHuman deck we presented to Eric, Derek, and WH stakeholders. Our mission was to illustrate the attendee experience from entering the building to heading home - and you nailed it. Great visuals, great copy, transparency in the numbers, the whole journey - it all came together.  Thanks for your passion, talent and commitment to excellence.\n\n519#Reimagine the possibilities!|I wanted to thank you all for the helping with the heavy lift of making sure all of our existing Globoforce assets now showcase our new brand! With a re-brand comes a lot of work and trying to track down all assets to make sure they align perfectly with the new logo and color is not an easy task. Thanks to you all we are able to show our true colors and represent Globoforce in the best way possible!\n\n520#Delivering Superior Quality!|Thank you for your focus and creativity in creating the deck for the WorkHuman walk-through with Eric. I appreciate the many great ideas you brought to the final version. And I love the ways in which you were able to bring the experiences to life!  I know this whole event will be exceptional and I look forward to seeing it come to life!\n\n521#Quick Creative|Jen, Thank you so much for taking time during an insane week just before the move to lend your graphic genius for the CHRO deck. Thanks especially for your sense of urgency - you got the shiny end product to me just in time before we were all unplugged. Much appreciated!\n\n522#Weekend help!|I am so thankful that both of you came in over the weekend to help with a lot of the finishing touches of the new space. From helping to clean and organize, to drawing on walls, every little bit helped get us to an amazing opening day. Thank you so much for taking the time to be here. I couldn't have done it all without you.\n\n523#Riding Into the Future|Jenn - thanks for your collaboration and teamwork over the last few weeks as we build out the brand guide. Creative and content go hand-in-hand, so a thoughtful, honest, respectful relationship is important. As partners to improving process and delivering new content and creative with speed and precision, there's so much wide-open road to travel. The only way to grow and scale is to establish a seamless, ego-less, cross-functional relationship to deliver on our promise of \"great.\" Thanks for your ideas, suggestions, feedback, enthusiasm, and passion.\n\n524#WorkHuman CHRO Outreach Campaign|Team - THANK YOU all so very much for your fabulous work on the WorkHuman CHRO outreach campaign. AMC and Anthony - amazing support creating 9 lists, Jen and Kelli - impactful designs for online and offline assets, Matt and Brian - quick turnaround on a new site and lots of requested changes, Aaron and Dan - fresh, compelling messages for this executive audience, Jill - setting up a custom CHRO registration experience, Stacey - getting the video of Eric done (and then redone), and of course Dianne for keeping us on track and on task! Great teamwork everyone!\n\n525#Mindful Meetings - Doing it Right!|I wanted to call out your participation in a wider team meeting we had yesterday.  It was such a great example of doing a meeting right here at Globoforce.  It was collaborative.  It was engaging.  It was open.  You all shared ideas - but also shared concerns about ways we could approach different opportunities - things that could make us more productive.  Questions were asked.  Solutions were brought to the table - with people building ideas off each other.  And it was also fun!  It should be the model for all the meetings we have here.  Great job!\n\n526#Kicking off a revolution|When we needed to brainstorm some new campaign concepts for WorkHuman this week, you all jumped on board, immediately throwing out creative and fresh ideas. The resulting campaign concepts are original, timely, and impactful and I can't wait to see how they perform in market.\n\n527#Ignite Keynote|To the A Team! Or the K Team! This years keynote was a team affair and the resulting presentation was a perfect way to kick off the event. Keynote presentations like these are months in the making, with a team of talented individuals all contributing ideas, messaging, innovations and graphics. The reaction was incredible and I want to make sure your contribution doesn't go unnoticed! Well done and thank you for your diligence, imagination and hard work. Now we need to get the K Team cracking on the Keynote for WorkHuman17!! Bring it on!\n\n528#Dynamic Duo!|Jen and Amanda - I wanted to take a moment to recognize and thank you for your incredible work over the past few weeks, months - on various keynotes/presentations for Ignite.

I had a rough outline of an idea and you made it look fantastic - I love it when someone makes my half baked ideas look a million dollars! All in the middle of working on Ignite. Thank you Perry much!  (too corny!?)\n\n531#\"Oh Captain, my Captain!\"|\"Oh Captain, my Captain\", those are words you often say when you have to ask me something, or tell me something important. Well, if I am your Captain, I couldn't ask for a better First Mate. When I describe you to people, I say, ''She is a champion of all-things-US; a champion of me (my own personal cheerleader), a champion of the Creative team, the Marketing team, the Globoforce team, mankind, the world!!!!\" You are always pushing the boundaries through story, design, your thoughts, and bringing it to life. Questioning the status-quo, making us all think a bit differently. You are on this planet to make a difference and I have the pleasure of working with you and seeing you do that every day.\n\n532#First-Place Winners of Marketing Hackathon|Congratulations to our first-place winners in the first-ever Marketing Hackathon! You embodied all our core values and the results were fantastic. The two-week Marketing sprint made us more agile as a team, brought out new ideas empowering every member of the team, and we found new approaches to market – ideas that could impact both our marketing approach and our go-to market for opportunities ahead.

Kevin\n\n534#Rise above|My role as a manager is to foster creativity and fuel the sparks of ideas so that you feel you are heard and can truly shine in what you believe in. When you passionately expressed interest in branding Workhuman 2017 with a different approach this year, I wanted to fuel that passion and blaze the path for your success. With minimal coaching, it was amazing to see you shine, presenting to the executive leadership highlighting your compelling storytelling capabilities. I am so proud of your confidence and determination to see this through. Keep up the great work!\n\n535#Thanks for being my \"peep\"|Thank you for all your help with the Q4 campaign!

At all times you were responsive and helpful with fresh ideas and a willing and helpful approach. I look forward to working with you again in the future!\n\n538#Praise for Perry|Thanks for coming to the rescue this week with the Petsmart custom demo. With no handoff you were able to pick up where I left off with easy. I was so sick I couldn't even write one sentence let alone the 5 paragraphs that was needed urgently. Thanks for coming to my rescue when I needed a princess in shining armor.\n\n539#Creative Acceleration|Dianne/Jen- Thank you so much for the creative development of the Culture in a Word Campaign. Not only did you accelerate the time it was finalized in, but your creative input was so imperative to this project. A project that was somewhat disjointed, is now a piece that can be used to trigger follow-up in a thought provoking way. I appreciate your hard work trying to find a printing vendor (who prints on velvet anyway??!!!) and efforts to get all the items ordered and invoiced by the EOQ. Thanks again!!\n\n540#Look how far we've come!|A huge thanks to the entire team for helping me compile our best work to submit for the 2015 Agency of the Year award. It required lots of helping hands from the timing and rendering of the video (thanks Mark!) to writing an awesome description about the work we did and the type of team we are (thanks Kristen!) to storyboarding (thanks Jen), pulling assets (thanks Stace!) and helping with inspiration (thanks Lisa!).  The final video was amazing thanks to you all! And to think it was all done in PPT! Mic Drop!\n\n541#Let's See How Far We've Come|Thank you for all of your invaluable expertise to help us perfect our IHAF Agency of the Year award submission. Your commitment and patience to getting it all done just right was bar none - from the design and the animations, to the written words, to the soundtrack - we were able to submit an award that truly reflects what a small but mighty team we are! We appreciate your time and effort and for being part of our team on this project!\n\n542#Creative Success for Customer Success!|Kevin, Sarah, Matt, Jen, Kelli and Stacey - Thank you all so much for your contributions to the Customer Engagement data sheet and the Customer Advisory Board micro-site.  Kevin and Sarah, you wrote beautifully, and finessed the content to clearly articulate all the ways in which we can engage customers as well as the benefits for them.  Jen,  you were the architect behind the design concept for the data sheet and came up with the idea for the micro-site that will not only serve as an elegant invitation to the Customer Advisory Board but also as a channel to communicate updates to the event for the CAB participants. Kelli, you designed the fantastic look and feel of the micro-site and Matt, you did all the technical work to turn that vision into a reality.  And Stacey, last but certainly not least you orchestrated all the moving parts to ensure all aspects of the project were delivered right on time.  Now we have tools to use across the company that can better engage our customers.  I'm in awe of your collective creative talents and thrilled with the end results!  Thank you!\n\n543#Starting the race!|Team- Way to launch another campaign! This one started off rocky, but we pulled together as a team and put together a list of assets, compelling content, a timeline to take us through Q3, brought WP's back to life, created new email templates based on recommendations from Eric and Jen, had our budget re-allocated and planned 3 webinars (2 of them with customers). I cannot tell you how much dedication and attention go into these IMC's but what I can tell you is I could not have done it with each and every one of you!! Thank you:)\n\n544#No one is COOLER!!!|Jen, thanks so much for your awesome creative slogan about being super cool for our corporate gift for the summer outing! After being asked by a few people to see if I had any creative juice in me...and failing miserably with my lack of clever and witty sayings, I ran over to your desk and you immediately had a stroke of genius! Thanks so, so, so, so, much for being cool and coming up with the coolest slogan for our awesome coolers!\n\n545#Sugar and spice|Jen- Thank you so much for all your hard work and dedication on pushing the Q3 campaign out for approval. You bring the sugar and spice to every concept and design! I'm looking forward to making this campaign as sparkly as Q2:)\n\n546#Brief or Bust|Stacey and Jen- Thank you so much for improving process and teamwork through the departments!  We are currently using a brief for campaigns, projects and tasks that may not have made sense to all departments involved, you took the initiative to talk threw it and make changes accordingly so we have a streamlined process.  You are both truly team players and it is always a pleasure working with you both.\n\n547#Creative Brainstorm for Q3|Thank you for bringing all of your creative juices to the table for our concept brainstorm earlier this week. I'm always amazed at how many pithy, poignant, whacky, and cool concepts we come up with when we put our collective creative heads together. But this award is really about respect for teamwork because each of you not only brought unique ideas to the table, but also listened attentively and patiently and collaborated to really bring those ideas to life. Great work!\n\n548#\"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\"|(Wayne Gretzky) Recognizing Jen Perry for always 'taking the shot' to promote the creative team's ideas. She makes some of the shots, she misses some; but she always articulates with solid background and supporting arguments to advocate for the team. Keep it up, Jen!\n\n549#Poised for Perfection Presentation|Jen  - I was so impressed with how you hit the ground running on the redesigned email project and presentation the last couple of weeks. You were able to listen to the problem and, not only interpret that perfectly, but you did your research, pulled us all together as a team, and created a thoughtful and eye-catching solution that we can all be proud of. Each of your designs were beautiful and I think whichever one we end up choosing it will be a hug win for the marketing team. You are an excellent leader and collaborator, thank you for all that you do!\n\n550#You heard what was needed|Jen - just a quick but well deserved thank you for being able to assemble our closing thank you slide for Harman under such a short deadline yesterday.  Combining the photos with the great closing line - WE LOVE LISTENING TO YOU (which HARMAN loved BTW) really helped us bring a great meeting to a strong and positive end.  Thank you so much for turning it for me in under 30 minutes.  Great teamwork under urgent and potentially stressful situations.\n\n551#JetBlue JD power video!|Thank you so much for such an a amazing collaboration on the JetBlue video! I know it was not an easy feat to rally everyone together from all over the world (literally) to show our customer how happy we are in their success. The program manager was so touched by what we did and it did not escape them that we had included the entire Globoforce family. Stacey it is always such a pleasure working with you on any project.

Great, great job Jen.\n\n554#Show and tell|Thank you ladies for quickly printing out a large sampling of Creative and mounting it up in 320 for an impromptu meeting. It meant so much to see how willing you were to jump in and help me. THANK YOU!\n\n555#WorkHuman Central!|Wow - what an amazing place for our attendees to congregate. This is what differentiates WorkHuman - this is what creates the 5 sensory experience. From candy stands and doughnut walls, to water charging stations and coloring tables. Thank you for your vision, creativity and management of WorkHuman Central. Truly unique and fabulous. Congratulations. You are WorkHuman.\n\n556#WorkHuman Keynote!|Kevin and Jen, my deepest thanks to you for all your help on my two keynote presentations. WorkHuman was an unqualified success! I keep hearing that it was the best HR, or any, conference that our attendees have ever attended.   I can't stop telling everyone about the energy, buzz and positivity that pervaded this event from start to finish, it was incredible to witness. It has truly tapped into the zeitgeist and allowed some unarticulated feelings and thoughts about where HR is today - be expressed and validated by the community.  You did an amazing job on my keynote. I was delighted with how well you turned some of those concepts from ideas into great slides and graphics, and that was just the start of it. The presentation was impressive, imaginative and put across complex ideas and themes in as simple a manner as possible. We bit off a lot to chew, but I think we pulled it off! But more than that, it was a true pleasure to work with you directly on it. I hope we work on more projects in the future. Your attitude and application are the best! Thank you so much!\n\n557#Opening video dream team!|Jenn, Jess and Julie, you were responsible for what I believe is the best opening video I have ever seen at a conference. This is the poster child example of how we should work. Not only did the end product come out beautiful but you executed this in the most efficient way. Jen - your poetic writing skills on the script were superb, Jen and Julie - your presence on site to direct the actual shoot was essential and productive, Jess your editing skills are masterful. The result a powerful, emotional and real opening to WorkHuman 2016. Congratulations and thank you. You are WorkHuman!\n\n558#Bringing a video vision to life|Jen - before this video shoot even finishes today, I want to call out your incredible ability to translate our Globoforce vision for the opening WorkHuman video into an actual live production reality.  You truly understand what we are trying to achieve, and also, what we need from the script, the actors and the art direction to bring this vision to life. You are a class act and a gifted professional and it's been a pleasure to work with you on this! Thank you.\n\n559#Helping to vet a new web agency|Thank you for taking the time to meet with several potential web design/development agencies over the past week.  We definitely saw the good, the bad, and the ugly, and your immediate feedback to each was invaluable.  Thanks for being part of this critical first step in the process.\n\n560#Creative Queen|Jen- Thank you so much for making EA Phase 2- Work Sucks* a priority this week with everything else going on! The first e-book and banners all look GREAT and I am so happy with how everything came together!! Looking forward to seeing the rest of the campaign start driving inquires. The race to 6.,900 in Q2 has begun!!!\n\n561#Pilot Onboarding Program Teamwork!|THANK YOU so much for being such a tremendous value-add to our new Onboarding Program this week.

I admire and appreciate your commitment and respect to our new program, as it helps in making Globoforce an even better place to work! Thanks a million for your participation and efforts.\n\n562#Fantastic work human signage show|I am so impressed with the work human signage presentation that you all put together in record time. From being on site last week in Florida, to five days later presenting a full signage and wayfinding experience to the team was amazing. As a team we all divided and conquered, and then pulled it all together into one connected, cohesive and inviting experience. The presentation itself was seamless, and most importantly we came in under budget. Presenting our strategic business acumen with amazing design prowess is integral to the success of the event but also our team. I am truly grateful and cannot wait to see what's next.\n\n563#Turn it up for Thermo|Stacey & Jen - When I reached out this afternoon with an urgent request from Kate @ Thermo regarding getting their branded deck updated before 12 PM on 3/9 you guys did an amazing job in getting it turned with a sense of urgency that shows our potential client exactly why Globoforce is the best possible partner for them to choose.   You are an extension of what we are trying to do as a team and now our potential client knows that what they need is very important to us and we got them their desired resulted with 1/2 day to spare!  So well done and thanks.\n\n564#Getting it done!|Thank you so much Jen for prioritizing, brainstorming and pushing out the EAD Campaign! A lot of hard work and dedication went into each and every component and I'm looking forward to working together on the next phases:)\n\n565#Clever Concepting|Jen and Aaron - Nice work on the Employee Appreciation Day concept.  You've taken all the feedback and came back with something creative that meets many messaging needs.  Thank you for your positivity, enthusiasm, and adaptability!   Kevin\n\n566#The 100th Apple|You guys turned around a last minute full page print ad in 72 hours. I don't know that there is much more to say. It's beautiful and impactful, and due to your hard work, we got to take advantage of an amazing opportunity that we otherwise would have missed. Once again, blown away.\n\n567#Making It Happen!|On the heels of Ignite, I came to you with a new initiative that we were spinning up just last week.  The challenge with this idea was that I gave you almost no time to react since we were going to announce this new effort in just a couple days. As I presented The Drive for 25 Hundred, I was met with a positive attitude and a \"We will get it done.\"  When we launched our WorkHuman outreach program on Monday, we had lunch, cake, balloons, and decorations for the entire office and it certainly help to reinforce how important this effort is to our company.  I am so grateful that I get the opportunity to work with you, and I appreciate your efforts and talents in making everything we do, a first class experience.  Thank you for making it happen.\n\n568#You all \"Shined\" for Schneider!|Stacey, Jenn & Kelli, thank you all so much for not only the fab designs for Schneider, but for the super fast turnaround.  Very much appreciated by yours truly, and by the client  who said the designs are \"superb\" - high praise indeed, but very much deserved.  Thanks again guys for great, fast, top class work - very well done and enjoy your awards!  Cheers, Kieran\n\n569#Imagination + Determination = YOU!|Jen -- Not enough good things can be said about the work you put into the new master deck. You had amazing vision on where the idea of the deck could be elevated to, and so much stamina to bring every detail to fruition through every major and minor setback. All that and you mastered and executed in the least design-friendly program. It was just amazing to watch it all come together under your skilled designer hands.\n\n570#Igniting the passion within, every year, every tim|To my amazing Creative Team, Ignite is one of our busiest times of year, it sneaks up on us every time. ;) All kidding aside, this year was like most however our deliverables tripled. No small feat for a group of 6 people. The past 4 weeks, our lives practically revolved around to the dozens of presentations that were prepped and created, the keynotes, the MASTER DECK, all the materials for the event itself (signage, badges) the 80s party invite, and much more. Many late nights and weekends were spent together working side-by-side to get everything completed to the ‘GloboBeautifullness' we strive for. Onsite you were there for 2 simultaneous video shoots, the wrap up video, the corporate headshots, the onsite event photographer and just being there for any last minute changes for support if needed. When you see everything up on the MainStage and in the rooms, you see just how amazing our level of quality is that we bring to Globoforce. I am super proud of you all, thank you for being such Globostars.\n\n571#Graphic Greatness|I just wanted to thank you all for all the tremendous work you all did up to and during Ignite. The show was absolutely amazing and it wouldn't be possible without everything that you do. From full design and polish to last minute edits and creative workarounds, you all showed tremendous determination and all the while, maintained such positive attitudes. You allowed me to have such great confidence in every presentation we showed and it made my job so much easier. Thank you so much!\n\n572#Evolving the sales deck|Thank you so so much for your help in evolving our master deck. This really was a Herculean group effort to transform the deck in the short time we had before Ignite. Thank you for your dedication, creativity and all the hours given over the holidays and weekends. We will continue to review and improve but I believe we have made huge improvements in the template, the Globoforce story, our differentiators and focusing on the humans in an organization. You rock!\n\n573#Customer Success Face-lift|Thank you for all of the support, guidance and creative genius that you put into the Launch Success and Customer Success Walls. You thought through the color scheme, the use of the wall space, the templates for the account names and even created custom power point decks to run on the TV's. Needless to say we couldn't foresee the November 25th incident, but because of the great work you had done we could still see all the great progress we were making and celebrate each stage while continuing to launch new clients. Thank you again!\n\n574#Building the decks|Jen, I can't thank you enough for dozens of hours you have put into building the two decks in a moment's notice, on MY machine since yours didn't work, with a new version of Office that is buggy. You painstakingly worked through the structure and then gathered all the slides, ensured that they were all Globobeautiful, all with a smile and patience of a saint. You are the essence of Globoforce values coming to life. Thank you!!!\n\n575#Handwritten signs, no problem!|Jen, you are amazing! You did some amazing handwritten signs for our Holiday Party raffles! They look really great! They will help make people spend all their hard earned cash on our prizes! Thanks again for your help!\n\n576#Without a sweat (and always with a smile)|The past few weeks have been incredibly gratifying having had the opportunity to collaborate and learn from such an amazing leader like yourself. Without a sweat (and always with a smile), you took on an incredible task of revamping the entire Globoforce deck for the Halliburton meeting - all the while cross training me on the new slide style in ONE day. Your specific direction and patience during this project is a true testament to the leadership you provide this team. Fast-forward to the holiday card; your deep understanding and intuitive knowledge on all things print was not only a learning lesson for me but an eye opener into the endless possibilities we as a design team can provide to our Globoforce community (within budget of course). You helped me hash out three different approaches for the card and execute them to the very end. You took your time walking me step by step in ID in order to get it perfect for print and I couldn’t be more excited to have you as my teacher for the tools I use everyday. I am so thankful to have you as my teammate! Thanks Jen!!\n\n577#PowerPoint Training|Jen,  Wow!  The new Ignite PowerPoint template looks amazing!  Nice work!  I wanted to thank you for running the team through the new features. All of the presentations will look clean and sharp thanks to your hard work.\n\n578#You Look Fabulous!|Ladies, what can I say, another quick turnaround with a touch of your fabulous work! Thank you both so very much for jumping in and helping this week on the SHRM Event we have planned for next week! We needed some great ideas in short period of time and you two always come up with some great work! Thank you for helping with all the creative work and also ordering the WH invitations for the event! We can always count on you!\n\n579#Our Finest|Thank you for being part of a great big team that creatively prepared and delivered a uniquely Globoforce experience to Halliburton this week. So much leadership from so many people throughout our organization--and it all came out in the details. I felt like all of you were in the room and hope you felt represented. It's amazing what we accomplish together. I hope to get the band back together for a follow up meeting in December. Many sincere virtual hugs and high fives to all! Very grateful for your long days and your vast talent!\n\n580#the MASTER of the deck|Jen -- I am floored by what you were able to put together for the base of the new master deck in such a short amount of time. You saw the size of the opportunity with the Halliburton pitch, and an opportunity to not only improve that one presentation, but use it as the step to move all future presentations forward. And you were not deterred by the number of slides or short amount of time there was to get it done. Just amazing work.\n\n581#I have seen the future, and it's gorgeous!!|Jess, Jen and Lisa -- what the world can see on the WorkHuman website already looks amazing, but I've seen \"the future\", with my inside scoop preview of the creative designs to come for our WorkHuman website, and it's sensational.  The three of you clearly have found your sweet spot for collaborative creative and design, and we are SO lucky that the WorkHuman brand is the recipient of the gorgeous results.  THANK YOU!\n\n582#Awesome Collaboration|I wanted to send a quick thank you to tell you how meaningful your collaboration on the Workhuman marketing planning has been. Thank you for being so supportive, always willing to jump in and help out. Your ideas have been dynamite, and the way you've been quick to see the overall vision, and determine lots of little ways to make it all easier and more efficient has been very much appreciated. Thank you for being true partners in this work, I'm so excited about what we can accomplish together.\n\n583#Mentor to the Max|Jen, thank you SO MUCH for taking the time out of your very busy week, last week, to work with me on the Halliburton timeline. You were patient with teaching me how to use our tool (Powerpoint) in a new way and innovative in the practice of what we were doing. I really appreciate your style of working with me as it helped me create something really incredible and learn while I was doing it. You are a fantastic mentor! Thank you!\n\n584#Making Thermo look good|Jen - Thank you so much for working with the raw material provided to you to make a beautiful deck on Thermo's PPT template as to why Globoforce is a better solution than OCT.  Your ability to visualize what our prospect is attempting to say to their senior leaders made the overall Globoforce solution look even better!  Thank you so much for taking the data and turning around a great solution in a very limited time frame.\n\n585#Beautiful Work - Fantastic Collaboration|Ladies - The work you did on the new Power of Thanks Black Box is stunning. Thank you for creating such a beautiful piece, and for getting the ball rolling on copy. It made my part of the job a breeze because it was half done! It's always such a pleasure to work with you both. Thanks for making us look so good!\n\n586#HR Tech Heroes!|Thank you so much for all of the hard work, collaboration, and dedication over the last few days to get the final pieces of collateral done for HR Tech. It was a pleasure to collaborate with all of you on the IBM co-branded piece and create an impactful asset that tells the IBM/Globoforce partnership story! Great job team!\n\n587#Globoforce Gives Back|Thank you all for taking the day and helping with our First Annual Globoforce Golf Tournament! Everyone did an amazing job selling raffle tickets, 50/50, and most importantly providing the hard work to raise all the money for Friends Never Forget as well as the mulligans for Las's charity that is near and dear to our hearts! I look forward to coming together next year and making this event bigger and better!\n\n588#Chocolates anyone?|I had my first custom demo for Godiva Chocolates and I was extremely impressed with the team that made this happen!  With minimal amount of information, the research, creativity and insight that you brought to the table was incredible! The boards and demo branding really captured not only the Godiva product brand but you also added a \"people\" element into the equation that didn't seem to exist with their corporate brand.  The Godiva team was extremely impressed and I know your efforts will go a long way! I had many questions and you were there to respond expeditiously and patiently.  (Who won the pool?)  Again thank you for the time and effort, it's truly an amazing team!\n\n589#Amazing results on the latest WorkHuman video|Thank you for the brand stewardship, content marketing, video direction and group teamwork that went into creating our latest WorkHuman video asset focused on the connection between WorkHuman and recognition.  This video brings the power of working human to life, and so clearly positions recognition as the best first step to get there.  I included this video in my Board meeting presentation last week in Ireland, and it got rave reviews.  Thank you!\n\n590#Jen to the rescue!|Jen, thank you so much for helping me prepare a design file for print.  You were speedy to jump in and help out with this rush client work. The printer received exactly what she needed, this wouldn't have been possible without you! Thanks again, you're the best!\n\n591#Collaboration & Communication|Thank you guys for having an honest, collaborative conversation about how we can all work together to do great work quicker. Looking forward to many more projects together.\n\n592#You put the POWER in Powerpoint!|Jen - your enthusiasm for enhancing recent powerpoint presentations - Ericsson and ADP to name a few - is infectious. Your ability to design to deliver key messages and for consistency and ease of understanding by both a presenter and an audience is adding so much value to the Globoforce community. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication and for taking these projects to a whole new level!\n\n593#Design Magic for Ericsson!|To Jess, Stacey & Jenn, thank you all so much for pulling out all the stops to get the Ericsson deck and demo done on time - we gave you a very tight turnaround time, but (as always!) you rose to the challenge and delivered an excellent design, which was very well received by the Ericsson team in Stockholm yesterday.  Thanks again guys - very much appreciate your above and beyond delivery on this one!  Enjoy, Kieran\n\n594#Wow!!!!   You knocked my socks off!|Jen and Stacey,  I am blown away and  so incredibly thankful and impressed!     I have been getting by with my presentations that were pulled together from all different sources, but have wanted for a long time to have a presentation that I was really proud of.   I am so happy that we got you guys involved and you took my presentation to a whole different level.    Jen, you are a powerpoint guru!!!   Thank you both so, so much for your creative genius!!!!!!!    Jen\n\n595#Princess PowerPoint|Jen, these past couple days you have shown such determination in tackling the all the PPTs that have come your way. Not only has it been a huge overhaul to sew together the story, but your persistent dedication to reconstructing the entire deck is truly inspiring. Its super exciting to hear how you are willing to roll up your sleeves, “chuck it out the window”, and really figure out how to tell our Globoforce story.  Fantastic job this week on the endless hours you spent poking around in our favorite program; POWERPOINT.\n\n596#LLA Ladies|I am so impressed with this creative team. Thank you all so much for your patient and tireless work on developing (and editing, and resizing) the huge quantity of LinkedIn Lead Accelerator creative required over the last few weeks. I love the two versions of look and feel that you came up with, it's exactly what I was trying to get at. The quality of all of the designs is top notch, and you've been incredibly helpful in getting every detail right so that we can start testing and hopefully gain more insight into what works best for our audiences! Thank you so much.\n\n597#Translating the experience|Jen and Julie - Thank you for your hard work and beautiful design in bringing the WorkHuman whitepaper to life. Your design has captured the experience of the event so faithfully and I hope will go a long way toward both reminding those who went why they loved it, and inspiring new attendees for 2016. Great work!\n\n598#Method to the madness|It is been so inspiring to see how you to have tackled the asset gathering and categorization of the materials that our team has produced for the last 18 months. It was a big ask, but you both dove in and are truly making this a reality. Categorizing all of the Globoforce brand components is no small feat. But what I loved the most, is sitting with you and reviewing the work that you printed and hung up on the walls. There is truly a 'method to the madness' in growing the brand and I was so proud to see how our team has evolved the brand using our core brand components over the past year and a half. When it's all said and done this is going to be an amazing documentation of where we've come, keep up the great work!\n\n599#Labels|Hi Guys -  Thanks again for all your help getting the labels together for my trip!   You are always there for me with my last minute requests.   As always, you create the most amazing things.   It has been a pleasure working with you :-) Thanks again for helping me with my upcoming event! Regan\n\n600#Grinning over Hershey Smiles!|Lisa and Jenn, Thanks for making the first case study infographic so beautiful! I love the tile layout--it gives the Hershey story a nice flow and can easily translate to our other client case studies. This infographic will be so valuable in helping sales communicate real results of social recognition. Awesome work!\n\n601#Down with owncloud!|I can't thank you enough for all the research, thought, and determination you put in to owncloud and its use by our team. You saw a need for a better solution, and you were able to not only build a business case for that need, but to find other ways to utilize our server and organize it so that everyone and anyone will be able to use it and find what they're looking for. Just another example of how you're taking our team to the next level. Thanks guys!!!\n\n602#Bringing Data to Life|You have such imagination and an amazing talent to do what you do everyday. You took a sheet of data and brought it to life with your designs for Julie's power point presentation at boot camp.  You turned the data, literally into a road that we all followed to understand it more clearly. Sometimes it can be tough to gets excited about data but not if Jenn Perry is creating the slides for it!! We are so lucky to have a creative team that gives everything they have into each project. Well done Jenn, I can't wait to see more work you produce!!\n\n603#Creating...it's what we do best|There’s been a lot of change that we’ve begun to implement over the last week and I can only say that I feel like the wheels are turning (full speed ahead) in the right direction. Your openness to new ideas, ways of working, learning, sharing and communicating has already begun to have a positive effect on the work coming from the creative department. I could not be prouder of our new, bigger, better team and the cohesiveness and collaboration that’s taking place.\n\n604#Making Us Look Great: SHRM Presentation Style|Jen – Thank you for all of your help with Derek’s SHRM presentation.  You worked late helping transform the deck into a more cohesive, branded presentation.  The end result was fantastic – graphically vibrant and also more intuitive to the viewer and audience in the way each section was connected to the others.  Thanks again for all of your work and enthusiasm!\n\n605#Pantone Perfectionists!|Thanks for taking me to the press check today! Coming from a digital agency, I'm so excited to start working on print projects, and I can't imagine better mentors to show me the ropes! Your attention to detail and knowledge of print processes and the globoforce brand really take our work to the next level!\n\n606#Design Team Deck|Post WorkHuman you have all been so incredible. Rallying together to help me put together an amazing deck, still scratching the surface of the info we can pull yet but it gets us started in conversations about succession planning and resources for the upcoming quarters. Highlighting all of the initiatives that I know we would be working on in Q3 and Q4 based on business objectives. This includes customer focused, consulting services, campaigns, sales and product and field, internal, Brand, and strategic account based marketing initiatives and you helped put it together for me into a digestible and highly visual form! You also researched events and companies creating very interesting data driven case studies for us to learn from as we embark on the new world of WorkHuman. Not only are you superb creatives but you are smart, driven and thought provoking thinkers. Thank you!\n\n607#Glass full of Spirit!|Thanks for all the collaboration on the Bacardi branding this past week! It might have been a long haul to nail down the right design, but we put our minds together and executed a beautiful package. With our hectic WorkHuman schedule, we teamed up to get the job down on time! Thanks team!\n\n608#Great Place to Work Microsite Taskforce!|Well it's official... our submission for the Great Place to Work list has been completed! I honestly can't thank each of you enough for all of your help and hard work  in creating our AWESOME new GPTW micro-site!!!!!! This will give the GPTW institute a realistic view into our great culture via storytelling, photo's and video. Not only did we get this done in record time, but you did this in conjunction with your efforts for Work Human, which was no small fete. One of my favorite things about working at Globoforce is the amount of collaboration and teamwork that happens here without even a second thought! It is truly like no other and I am so proud to work with such wonderfully talented people. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you a thousand times for being a great partner to HR. I can't wait to share the site with everyone! Now fingers crossed until October!!!!   Thanks again!\n\n609#One team, one dream !|I don't even know where to start! Kelli, thank you for taking on the last minute print piece and jumping in wherever needed. Stacey, thank you for your commitment to getting out all of the last minute print items and working with fedex all week while dealing with all the other WH craziness. Jen, your vision for the video pieces and visual identity of WorkHuman was truly inspirational, and your commitment (working until early morning in club Darcy even after your computer died!) was very much appreciated. Jess, it has been an absolute joy to see your vision come to life in the space that was WorkHuman. From the bookstore to the candy stand and everything in between, you made sure the conference was absolutely flawless. Kat and Carrie, thank you so much for holding down the fort while we were away!!! This team is so strong, and I can't wait to see what we will all accomplish next!\n\n610#WorkHuman Customer Experience - A Team Effort!|Wow!

So beautiful and impactful that I had goose bumps!  The award videos were also amazing and came together perfectly! Darcy, thank you for your help with the customer communication and your content direction was incredible - what value you have brought to every part of the event that you have touched - which is basically the entire event! Kevin, thank you for working on the Ambassador experience and providing input on many areas of the customer evening also.  Kerry, thank you for driving the meet and greets and Pam, thank you for keeping us on track with the i’s dotted and t’s crossed across so many areas large and small, your attention to detail is a wonder! Nothing passes you by down to the last detail – table tents, name badges, place cards and more.  Anne Marie, Anthony and Jess D, thank you for your help with customer registrations and automated communications! Having your assistance helped provide visibility as we tried to drive recruitment and peace of mind as we implemented the customer communication plan.  Thank you Team!  What a privilege it is to work with such professionals!  I am so excited by what we have created this year and the mind boggles with what we can do next year!  Thank you!\n\n611#Dream Team|If I could wrap all 5 Awards into one recognition I would, but since I cant I choose teamwork. We began this WorkHuman journey together 6 months ago and the results of everyone's hard work, perseverance, dedication, passion and commitment was evident leading up to the conference and definitely throughout the conference. The conference was the most visually appealing I have ever been to. Our content and program was powerful and motivational, our social media outreach was phenomenal, Workhuman central was interactive and provided great networking opportunities. The onsite teamwork shown by the blue team, registration team and all of our greeters was very personal and friendly. I couldn't have been more proud to have such a great group of humans to take this journey with. Thank you to all for making this truly a dream team for me.\n\n612#Marketing Magic at Workhuman|The conference speaks for itself.  Well done!\n\n613#WorkHuman Mavens|While I am new to GF, I am far from being green to team dynamics.

Thanks for making WorkHuman amazing and a conference that will be one for the books!\n\n614#Design. Detail. Drive.|I have NEVER worked with a team with so much skill, thoughtfulness and determination to take on ANYTHING that comes their way. Your expertise combined with you attention to detail and a positive attitude have made amount of work that you've all handled EXCEPTIONAL. I'm not just talking about WorkHuman (although that's a big part of it) but sales packages, tradeshow booth redesign, master deck and training  - just to name a few. Your enthusiasm for what you do is inspiring and I'm glad we've also been able to have a few laugh along the way at \"our table\". You're  the best around and I know there's so much more greatness to come from our growing team!\n\n615#Determined to cross the finish line in style|The amount of time and effort you have put into every single piece that you have touched designing work human materials is simply amazing. Working late and weekends almost every night creating beautiful assets for everyone to enjoy in a few short days.

I can not wait!\n\n616#Bokeh Visionary!|Thank you for being the driving force in the creation of Workhuman animations.  I can’t emphasize enough how impressed I’ve been with your vision and enthusiasm in making this idea come to life. From the beginning you’ve emphasized that these animations were part of a complete design concept for the look, feel and experience for the event. You, along with the rest of the marketing team have succeeded brilliantly in creating something pretty special for Globoforce’s customers.  I truly appreciate that you’ve allowed me to join in the fun, and I look forward to many future collaborations with you!\n\n"

YOU BOTH KILLED THIS!!!! :D\n\n618#The other half of my brain|Jen - The pace at which we've all been working over the past few months has been stupifying, and it is so reassuring to be able to work with a team of designers that is so flexible and graceful in managing so much. And the work you are turning out is really breathtaking! But I have to send a special thank you to you, my partner of the index cards, because sometimes when I realize I have only half a brain and start to panic, I know I can ALWAYS borrow some of yours. You are guaranteed to be on my wavelength and seem to understand me even when I'm incoherent. Sometimes we have whole conversations about projects with a raised eyebrow, a shoulder shrug, a nod and a grin. I am very grateful you've decided to stay with us! You are such a talented addition to our team. But selfishly, you're also a great partner to me as a writer. And I'm especially grateful for that! Thank you! =)\n\n619#Creative Coverage to the Core|I cannot begin to thank each of you enough for you keeping things running so smoothly while I attended the HOW Design Conference in Chicago. The level of detail, time and effort that went into the WH signage was overwhelming and you handled it with grace (even into the late evening hours). So many important sales presentations and RFPs were brilliantly branded - many with quick turn around times. And of course all of the last minute requests were answered and managed with a smile. Your communication kept me up-to-date and made coming back into the office that much easier. Most of all, having a team I can trust to get the job not only done, but done well, allowed me to soak in so many amazing learnings that I’m beyond excited to start implementing for our continued growth!\n\n620#Total Rewards 2015 will be a sweet success!|I wanted to take a moment and recognize all of the great work you've done planning Total Rewards 2015. From the globocandy.com site design, to the Power of Thanks book sponsorship, to the customer branded Hershey bars, you've done a fantastic job ensuring that our presence at the show will not only be outstanding but will showcase our thought leadership and our admired customer, Hershey. Everything looks amazing, and ties together perfectly from a messaging and brand standpoint. Great job team!\n\n621#Let's Scream It for 200 WorkHuman Registrants!|To my incredible team of WorkHuman Marketing and Promotional Rockstars - THANK YOU.

Your attention to detail while looking at the big picture has been invaluable over this last month as we plan for so many new and exciting programs.

They look amazing and you both worked around the clock to make sure we submitted the various versions (and there were many!) on time to our publications. They went live this week and I couldn't have done it without you both.\n\n631#It all starts with a J|Ladies - I remember a few weeks back sitting in a kick off meeting regarding some of the presentations and design deliverables we were tasked with for Ignite, and you both just rallying together, shotgunning creative ideas, and divvying up tasks to on how to make it the best it could be. It was a super collaborative meeting, and you both took it to the next level. Jen, first of all, please stand up and pat yourself on the back! In the short amount of time that you have been here you have showed so much passion and eagerness towards every little task and idea that has come through. Julie, you're effort and team spirit is what truly pushed us over the finish line. I have witnessed you both pulling together, and saw the final result in an astonishing marketing ppt. Great job ladies! I'm so thankful for you both.\n\n632#To the plastic surgeons of my plain presentation..|Now that Jennifer has been entered in Globostars, I can finally thank you both together and properly for the INCREDIBLE visual facelift you gave to my Ignite presentation.  The messaging was done, but the visuals were nowhere, and then came you two, and some amazing time talking and collaborating with you both, and soon thereafter, my presentation looked gorgeous. You are both so talented, and last week I was the lucky recipient of that talent. Thank you so very much!\n\n633#Welcome and Thank You!|Jen,    I can't say enough wonderful things about your joining our small creative team during such a busy time for us. You have taken everything that has been given to you in great stride with an amazing curiosity for the business and the brand. You have been an absolute pleasure to work with and get to know over the past WEEK AND A HALF and it seems like you have been here longer! I consider that a great thing :) Thank you for all of the work you have done, so far (Julie Z's presentation collaboration, ebooks) and, in advance, for the great things to come! So happy to have you on the team!\n\n634#Amazing first week|It's not easy coming in to an organization during the busiest week for Marketing. You came in and hit the ground running. Within a days time, you had read and researched, asked a ton of  questions, and began working right away. Most importantly, you were immersed yourself in our culture. It is safe to say that we all feel as if you have been here for years, and truly look forward to many more memorable moments with you.
