"0#It's in the details|After hearing a lot of real-time reactions and feedback at Unleash I wanted to give this team a shout out for the thoughtfulness that went into the conceptual ideation behind the booth theme and the ties made to Forum. Every detail was intentional, and I heard from multiple attendees that they really resonated with our Elevate theme and messaging, loved the booth's connection to France, and wanted to learn more about Workhuman. I know there was a lot of research, brainstorming, and coordination that went into bringing the theme to life, it was noticed by many and so appreciated!\n\n1#Soaring high in Paris!|I'm getting a bit tired of congratulating you all for (yet again) setting a new bar, but when you all helped pull off what was our largest and most impactful 3rd party event activation EVER, it has to be done!  This team absolutely crushed it last week, delivering two amazing back-to-back events with our first ever Workhuman Forum in Paris and then straight into UnleashWorld, where we dominated attendee mindshare. From the months of planning and design, to pre-event registration drives, meeting scheduling, and hospitality planning, to the flawless on-the-ground execution, it was an extraordinary end result.  The quality of engagement you all drove across an action-packed 3 days and nights doesn't just happen by chance. Every detail was sweated over. Every activity was well prepped and rehearsed. And the plan was orchestrated and delivered to perfection.  I couldn't be more proud of the effort put forth by you all and seeing the results of that effort take form. A sincere THANKS to all who contributed, with special thanks to our extraordinary Events team, who just set that new bar in how to show up big and deliver an extraordinary experience.\n\n2#Lighting the way!|Jill, it was a pleasure collaborating with you on our first installation of Davos creative and my first major initiative here at Workhuman. I can't thank you enough for your leadership, guidance, and, frankly, support as we hustled to put our stamp on one of the world’s largest stages. In what will be the first of many, I'm stoked to take on our next challenge and stack another win! Onwards!\n\n3#Strength in Change|Jill, I just want to say how much I appreciate you. You’ve really shown up for your team and led with such strength and empathy through all the change happening around us. It’s clear how thoughtfully you balance the big-picture strategy with genuine care for the people involved. I know how much you’ve had to juggle recently, and I’ve been so impressed by how you’ve kept everything (and everyone) moving forward. You’re a steady, inspiring force—thank you for that.\n\n4#Our ideas go big (41x17 ft)|The Davos billboard creative is solidified, and now in the hands of fate. This collective of bright brand minds was instrumental in helping mold the message we’re putting in front of thousands at the World Economic Forum. In order to arrive on like 15 words, we had to consider all the words (gasp), and I’m grateful Jill assembled this A-list crew to help get us there. Getting exposure to your unique POVs was hugely insightful for me, learnings I'll carry beyond this project.  Thanks again for the brain buffet.\n\n5#Feedback in a Flash|Thank you all for going outside the regular process this week to give quick, in the moment feedback and approvals for Unleash. We had an aggressive timeline to get things to print, and you all made the time to get us prompt and efficient feedback. Appreciate you!\n\n6#Site Visit Superstars!|Our few days in Orlando were jam packed, but you all came with your comfy sneakers ready to get at it.  We saw offsite venues, hotels and walked the convention center from end-to-end. Thank you for all of your effort, insights and teamwork. There are many moving parts, but this teams holds it all together.  Plus you're kinda fun. Workhuman Live 2026 is in full swing!\n\n7#Presenting partners|Just need to shout out what a stellar team this is!!! The process for creating our QMR presentation has become as seamless as our everyday work. From meeting altogether to align on what story we want to tell, to executing all the bits and pieces, this was a dream! Lisa, you made our slides fun and memorable and I can't thank you enough for doing the design lift so we could each focus on our individual talking points. Anne & Alana you both came to the table with such great content and it really helped us articulate the difference between creative success and business success when it comes to promoting WHLive. I know presenting is NOT either of your favorite, but it's clear that when you are the expert on the subject, you are both spectacular at it! I think my most valuable takeaway was going through all of our learnings just for ourselves – I mean, I hope it was useful to everyone else too – but it was a great exercise to just align within our own team on what really works and what doesnt! Cheers on what I think was the best QMR ever and a GREAT way to put the event team's best foot forward!\n\n8#Works Great, I know!|Bravo, to this tremendously talented group! You might violate HR (and lead it at the same time) but your performance at our End of Summer Celebration event was killer. I thank you for taking the time to not only just perform the day of but truly appreciate your commitment to take all the time to rehearse and coordinate all the things that go along with it. Your manager should be proud! Cheers to the next gig.\n\n9#paving the way|Jill - I see you. I see all the time, attention, and effort you are putting in to welcome all the members of your expanded team. My first thought was you are 'building bridges', but that's not it because there was no big divide. You are paving the way. The way forward for a team that collaborates, shares the workload, the ideas, the creativity. You are building trust with transparency, team meetings, skip-levels, and active listening so you can learn and be the best leader for each person, and the team. It's a lot. Keep going!\n\n10#Raising the bar (again)|Jill and Richard,  While it truly takes a village to deliver an exceptional WHL experience, that village requires impassioned, dedicated, and motivating leadership. You designed a thoughtful and highly engaging program, built a front-to-back experience centered on all participants, orchestrated every last detail to its full execution, and addressed every unforeseen obstacle with poise, professionalism, and speed. Leading from the front doesn’t begin to describe the truly exceptional job you both did to inspire your teams to do their best work…which they all did supremely well. I could not be more proud of what (and how) you two delivered for the Workhuman brand. Truly remarkable planning, execution, and exemplar leadership.\n\n11#An Extraordinary WHL|What you pulled off at Workhuman Live was nothing short of extraordinary. Every single detail—from the technology that powered the experience, to the stunning creative that framed our brand and our executives—was executed with precision, care, and excellence.  You created an environment that didn’t just look exceptional, but felt like Workhuman. The logistics, the operations, the room blocks, the speaker briefings, the attendee journeys—you orchestrated every piece with a level of rigor and creativity that made the impossible look effortless.  From the first pre-promotion touchpoint to the moment attendees walked into the space, to the content creation, the live on-site execution, the speaker curation and delivery, to the last-minute signage changes and the seamless video production—you owned it all. And you did it while managing thousands of humans moving through a complex environment, aligning every detail to our theme, our purpose, and our mission.  You brought Eric’s keynote to life with vision and thoughtfulness. You made sure our content tracks were cohesive, our speakers prepared and impactful, and our message loud and clear across every stage, room, and moment.  This was more than a flawless event. This was a defining moment of brand leadership—something only Workhuman could do, because of you.  I’m phenomenally proud of this team. Let’s carry this momentum into Orlando 2026. I already can’t wait.  —Richardtemp\n\n12#The Most PERFECT Conference Badge -- EVER|It's been 10 years in the making...we've laughed, we've cried, we've fought, I've pouted, but we've finally done it! The new badges for Workhuman Live 2025 are great. It is the perfect font, font size, boldness, background, color contrast for the first name and the company name. The badge colors and people icons add the right amount of attendee information to help us prioritize are interactions at the event. Thank you for taking the time to listen to our needs and to make it happen for this year's event. It will make a world of difference for us all at the event!\n\n13#Team Goodness|What a team! Big ups to my partners in crime at the ELT \"onsite.\" Everyone brought creative ideas and innovative contributions to our project. Most importantly, we learned about one another, made strong connections, and elevated our collective games. Well done!\n\n14#\"How can I help?\"|A shout out to this team who always happy to help. The days leading up to an event are always stressful, but each person here checked in to see what you could help with, whether it was helping move 70 pound crates, finding a pair of scissors, helping manage the 500 person queue, or even just keeping us hydrated. You all make sure no one is ever left behind. I appreciate you all!\n\n15#From London to Paris|When it comes to a site visit with the events team there's two things I know for sure, it's going to be super busy + productive, but it's also going to be a lot of fun! At the beginning of the week, this group masterfully managed so many aspects of WHL Forum London, to immediately switch gears and start planning for Paris! It was so impactful to see the space and to hear the strategic ideas and questions that will no doubt make for another thoughtful and memorable event! Thank you for a great week and lots of laughs along the way!\n\n16#Events Leadership|Before I submitted this award i googled (for fun) \"what is a good manager\". I found an article that said \"Great leaders tap into the needs and fears we all share. Great managers, by contrast, perform their magic by discovering, developing, and celebrating what’s different about each person who works for them\"  As i was reflecting on my quickly-approaching maternity leave I realized a lot of those typical insecurities women tend to face as they approach big life changes, are not things I have to worry about because I have a supportive boss.  As a team we often talk about how you are the best, but today I was reminded that I should also be telling you.   I appreciate having a female leader that not only understands life changes, but supports them. That not only understands our work and what we put into it, but also supports the development and decisions behind them. I most of all appreciate the trust,  transparency, and many laughs. The events team is lucky to have you!\n\n17#Tireless leadership|OK, maybe that title is a lie, it'd be totally ok if you were actually tired – and maybe even tired of leadership – but you make it LOOK tireless. There have been so many moving parts happening since the start of the year from adopting a new function to the endless stream of Q1 events and launches and I just wanted to call out how much I appreciate you and your mentorship. You look out for the team and each person's individual goals, you're trying to balance the budget and planning for team growth and our always top-notch production events, and yet you're still taking on new things like championing Asana and making sure to spend quality time on all our Reflections. It doesn't go unnoticed or unappreciated – it is a lot of work. This week is the last deep breath before Forum and the landslide toward Live in Denver – I hope you go into it all feeling as great as we all think you are!!\n\n18#Human Intelligence Core Collaborators|As we make the final approach to the Human Intelligence 2025 Release digital event, I want to send a massive THANK YOU to this core group of collaborators that I've had the pleasure of working closely with over the last 4 months.  It's fitting that the animation above says \"Good things come to those who don't wait,\" because when we were tasked with organizing this campaign and event back in late October, this group wasted little time in strategizing how to deliver Workhuman's most impactful innovation release against some serious time constraints.  The results speak for themselves. We've already reached over 8,000 registrations that include almost 100% customer coverage, and we can all agree that the messaging, copy, and creative that has been delivered through this project has been next-level.  Personally and professionally, I can't thank you all enough for this experience. I've learned so much from each of your different expertise and through how you each approach cross-functional collaboration on this scale. What I'm most impressed by is the consistent positive attitude and collaborative mindset. This was a big undertaking that required a lot of strategic and execution-focused work, but we were so productive because we kept the focus on progress.  Can't wait for the next one...lol\n\n19#Leveling Up! Driving this Mega Event Train Forward|Jill, your leadership has truly set a new standard this year. You’ve set a new pace, upleveled the quality of our work, and ensured operational excellence at every turn. From leading site visits and holding the team accountable to delivering an exceptional event strategy, your impact is undeniable. From driving a one-of-a-kind digital events for the Human Intelligence 2025 release to executing an outstanding Activate event, you’ve not only elevated the quality of our work but also redefined the pace at which we operate. You're in tune (see what I did there!) with our message framework and the message we need to deliver internally and externally and you're bringing that to life in such creative and experiential ways - we will see that in the Activate feedback.  What stands out most is your ability to manage up effectively—keeping me informed while keeping this mega train on the tracks AND your ability to be EVERYWHERE. Your commitment to making sure the right people are in the loop, all while maintaining team culture and morale, is nothing short of exceptional. Thank you for your relentless dedication, strategic vision, and ability to bring these complex initiatives to life. Keep up the phenomenal work!\n\n20#Leaning into strategy!|Team — I truly appreciate the dedication, critical thinking, and collaboration that went into refining the Human Intelligence 2025 release story and overarching narrative arc this week. The willingness to come together, challenge ideas, and push for alignment is what will make this launch exceptional.  From the zoom-in and zoom-out introduction video, to Eric’s keynote, the 15–20+ vignettes, the product segments, the reward stories, and culminating in the Josh Bersin final interview, every piece of this story must connect seamlessly—and your commitment to that vision is clear. Aligning on a storyboard, ensuring we’re all moving in the same direction, and sharpening the narrative is absolutely critical to its success.  Thank you for being vulnerable, for leaning into strategy, and for putting aside personal preferences in service of a powerful, unified vision. This story is going to make an impact—not just for Workhuman, but for the entire HR industry. I can’t wait to see it come to life!\n\n21#Voice of Activate|making Laury the voice of Activate wouldn’t of been possible without all of you. From scripting to recording to Avatar design and animation everyone brought the energy to turn this around quickly and swiftly! Laury as digital host for the win!\n\n22#Leveling up the merch experience|For those that know, my 21-yr old has been following the WH merch story for a decade, and just when you think there’s no other creative idea, 🎤…yes there is! Bringing us a store is genius. Allowing us to try on sizes vs make our best guess is super inclusive. Shipping for those of us who are as packed in our suitcases as can be, so thoughtful. Thank you to all who leveled up the experience ~ so creative, thoughtful and mindful, it was fun and I can’t wait to enjoy my new swag!\n\n23#Video shoot Mentorship|Jill, I want to thank you for taking the time to teach me the ins and outs of filming promo videos for our upcoming product launches. I walked into today expecting to watch Sarah's video shoot and you took me under your wing once you noticed a great interest I had in this area. You walked me through the process, allowed me to sit in the studio during filming, and were open to the ideas I had that would make the script sound consistent. Not only does it take an authentic leader to be open to this, but given that we work in different departments, I felt like I learned so much from you in just a day. Thank you again for not only your time, but for your mentorship!\n\n24#Solid Support on HI.|Thanks and appreciation to all of you for your support in my absence these past weeks. Knowing you all were covering for me where needed enabled me to focus on my family completely.\n\n25#Good Partnership|Thank you, Ashley, Jeff, and Jill for your fantastic partnership on the Human Intelligence 2025 Release creative development. To Ashley, we appreciate your clear, smart brief. To Jeff, thanks for sharing your experience and the way you provide productive, considerate feedback. And to Jill, for trusting the brand creative team to deliver. Really looking forward to seeing this integrated campaign to life.\n\n26#Supreme Collaboration for Accelerated GTM Planning|Just want to start this off by saying this is an incredible group of people. I have been constantly amazed and impressed throughout this past month+ by this group's ability to collaborate decisively to organize and take action on the Marketing plan for the Human Intelligence 2025 Release.  I've been so inspired by how you all quickly acted to present innovative plans for the Human Intelligence launch to only then act even quicker to move forward with execution. In the weeks leading up to the holidays, you all have worked together to brainstorm, workshop, and problem-solve, all while respecting the necessary work-life balance people need to enjoy the holidays for family and friends.  My experience working with you all this project thus far has me extremely excited about what we will accomplish in 2025. I really appreciate the way this group conducts itself and couldn't be more proud to be a part of it.\n\n27#My heart grew three sizes that day...|Yesterday, we held an informal WHL update meeting. When it ended, the team applauded. What an amazing show of support and camaraderie. Just like the grinch, my heart grew three sizes!    And now I applaud you. This event is successful because of this team's contributions, collaboration, passion, and leadership.\n\n28#Cheers to one year on team events!|When we transferred officially to the events team a little over a year ago, you wasted no time making us creatives feel like an integrated part of the team. But I think what has made you such a great leader is your openness, trust in your team, and support on even the littlest things. Your transparency and collaboration has been instrumental in how our team works and how we feel about the work we are doing. Thank you for continuing to be a leader who shows up authentically, listens, and makes sure we all feel valued.\n\n29#Moving Fast and Breaking Norms|Team, over the past two weeks, you’ve truly embodied the spirit of “Move Fast and Break Things.” Your efforts in shaping innovative concepts for the 2025 Human Intelligence Release and the Brené Brown Roadshow are nothing short of extraordinary (in line with record approval timelines)  You’ve shattered conventional thinking, embraced greater risk with a bold vision and experimentation (untested) with new approaches — all while maintaining your deep understanding of digital and event execution. By leading with positivity and opportunity, you are not just breaking execution norms but rebuilding them in ways that inspire and ignite transformation and culture within the team.   You’re not just moving fast; you’re moving forward, and the ripple effect of your positivity and innovation is already evident in the direction we're moving and the \"insider speak\" about these projects.   Thank you for your courage, your passion, and your ability to take our ideas to new heights. Let’s keep the momentum going!\n\n30#Celebrating Leadership|Shout out to you Jill on National Bosses Day.  I’m grateful for your leadership and guidance. It inspires us to keep pushing to be our best. Your dedication to the entire team drives a commitment to excellence in everything we do.  I’ll speak for myself and say while I don’t always hit that mark on first try, your endless support to cultivate growth, learning, and impact means the world and we are all better for it.  Thank you!\n\n31#Big Deal|Jill - what you just achieved with our new event partnership in EMEA is nothing short of amazing. Leadership and commitment at it's finest, over the past 6 weeks you strategically tagged in the right level players for the right tasks at the right times. You prepped the people. You steered the conversations and negotiations like the pro that you are. This is a big deal, and so are you! Cheers!\n\n32#Plan the Work and Work the Plan|Team, thank you all for a highly collaborative, productive, and engaging workshop this week. We took two full days as a team to review program, cultural, and MELT performance. We were vulnerable and transparent, we questioned everything, we debated critical growth areas and areas of improvement. Tyler provided a HX strategy update on how we plan the org and foster unity in the marketing organization. We walked away with critical next steps that will inform the unified GTM strategy in 2025 while setting the stage for a great H2 and 2025. Thank you all for the participation, the preparation, and for driving the business forward.\n\n33#That's a Wrap|The 2024 Spotlight Series just wrapped up! The 2nd and 3rd episodes were only a month apart! Thank you for your participation. The work started almost a year ago and each of you said 'Yes' to your role, whether it was work that spanned over the year, or involved being recorded for a segment. A lot of work goes into this event - planning, sourcing, promo, web, tech support, scripting, recordings, post-production. The list is long, and so is the list of humans who support this event. The team learned and pivoted over the year, modified the segments, adjusted the promo, never gave up on sourcing speakers, got creative with recording locations, and masterfully edited the episodes to include the best of the best content. Spotlight is the bass guitar of the Events portfolio - the important steady beat supporting our message and a platform to share it with the world. Cheers to all of you!\n\n34#Offer Accepted|We have a new Sr. Specialist hired for the Event Marketing team. Thank you to this stellar hiring panel for taking the time to interview multiple candidates, focusing your questions on the specific hiring criteria assigned and sharing candid feedback.  Because of your efforts, we were able to get a full view of each candidate's qualifications and will be able to get Emily onboarded as we ramp up our promotions for Workhuman Live 2025.\n\n35#Paying my dues!|It's long overdue and seems only appropriate that my first Spark award goes to all of you!   For all the collaboration, teamwork, support, awesomeness and big laughs over the past few years that I wasn't able to recognize through the platform! Glad to be part of this team!\n\n36#Just past the Spotlight|Past the Spotlight, were a group of humans who spent part of the day sitting still in the background. Thank you for taking time to be part of the Spotlight episode 3 customer segment. Cheers!\n\n37#No printers? No problem.|Friends, I am so unbelievably grateful to work with you all. When we were faced with the potential that the badge printers may not work in London, this team immediately sprang into action to find an alternative solution. From finding print shops willing to take on the job, to designing badge files, to helping me talk through our options, you all made me feel confident that we would be find a resolution. I cannot thank you enough for your sense of urgency during this and it once again shows what a talented set of individuals we have on this team.\n\n38#Gratitude for the Gratitude Bar Experience|We had to pivot this week to come up with a solution for the Gratitude Bar at WHL Forum. We came to an agreement on what the challenges are that we needed to solve and what the attendee experience. We sowed the seeds of a few ideas - one of which took root and now less than 24 hours later, it has blossomed into a fully vetted solution that should work for this event and many in the future. Here's to flower power!\n\n39#Aba awesomeness|Thank you to each of you for your incredible support during the Executive Dinner at Aba during WHL! Your dedication, hard work, and coordination were key to making the dinner a success. From weekly calls, to approving and sending invites, to setup, to facilitators and runners, to our gracious hosts - each of you played an important role. And despite the challenges of another long day, your unwavering commitment ensured that everything ran smoothly, leaving attendees with a fantastic experience!\n\n40#In the midst of brilliance|As we reflect on the resounding success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I am compelled to extend my deepest gratitude and admiration to each of you. Your leadership has been instrumental in turning a bold vision into an awe-inspiring reality, cementing its status as the premier conference for business leaders worldwide.  Your meticulous attention to every facet of the event, from pre-promotion, central, design & experience to speakers, technology, production, communications and surrounding events, has transformed ambitious ideas into a seamless experience for over 3,000 attendees. Your ability to orchestrate, collaborate, and innovate—while setting egos aside—has not only elevated our brand and the WHL \"product\" but has also reinforced our promise to the community we serve.  The dedication, creativity, and problem-solving skills you displayed were pivotal in crafting an event that not only met but surpassed expectations. The quality of the keynote speakers, the depth of the sessions, and the flawless overall execution ensured that every participant left feeling connected and inspired. Your efforts have strengthened our relationships with customers, partners, and prospects while enriching the HR community and paving the way for new opportunities in pipeline creation and customer retention. The spirit of collaboration and inclusivity you fostered has set a new benchmark for excellence and showcased the true essence of Workhuman.  I am truly grateful for your hard work, passion, and unwavering commitment to excellence. I'm so proud to have you on ALL on the team. Thank you, every one of you, for your significant contributions.   Richard\n\n41#It's great seeing you in action|Jill, calling you out for some great creative thinking here. We met today with some players representing an off-plan ask for internal event support. With more sizeable off-plan asks like this one, finding the resources (people and money) to make it work can be tough. On the call today, you listened carefully, ensured you understood some of the key moving parts tied to scope and funding, and you offered up several creative ideas for how to create the best experience possible while also saving money in the process.  They were all received well and I have confidence they'll make a real impact on the event.  Thanks for all you do to make events here a great experience.\n\n42#Welcoming newcomers|Thank you all for your support of the Newcomers on Tour at WHL. This was a new activity this year that we developed to support a specific attendee journey. As with all new ideas, it required a lot of work behind the scenes to plan & develop and it required a lot of humanpower to pull it off onsite. Thank you to everyone who helped create and market the experience. Thank you to our hostesses who guarded the doors and shepherded the attendees onsite. And thank you to our fearless tour guides for making the experience educational and entertaining for attendees.\n\n43#Our Fearless Leader|When reflecting on Austin over the last couple days I'm immediately reminded that we are the luckiest team (not to play favorites but...) You trust your team, while also lifting us up, being the voice of reason, and somehow through the crazy we leave with sore abs from laughing as hard as we do. It puts a new spin on work hard, play hard, and I am so grateful to have you leading the way to Austin and beyond.  Even when leading the way means jumping in and placing sticky notes :)\n\n44#Little things that matter!|Nicole, Jose, Erin, Jeff, Ashley and Jill - thank you for helping me with the many little things that needed attention to ensure a smooth experience for the customers as well as myself at Workhuman Live the past week. From coordinating parking passes for the CDO, to getting creative with me to ensure prime seats were reserved for our VIP guests, to correcting my name on the app to avoid confusing customers, to taking notice that I wasn’t keeping myself nourished while running around, to making sure my water cooler reservations accommodated the large Execuitve group, to making sure my hotel booking was done correctly… the list goes on! These may seem like small things but they each had a big impact in the audience that was involved. Every little thing adds up to a collective experience and I appreciate each one of you for making it easier for me to deliver a flawless one. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!\n\n45#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders. To our magnificent events team, your ability to transform our vision into a stunning reality is nothing short of miraculous. Every detail of the event was crafted with precision, turning ambitious ideas into an awe-inspiring experiences for over 3,000 attendees. Your dedication and creativity have not only set a new benchmark for excellence but have also showcased the true spirit of Workhuman. The cross-functional execution of the Sales, Marketing, and Customer teams was crucial in weaving the rich tapestry of this event. Your efforts have fortified our brand's promise and paved the way for new opportunities in pipeline creation and customer retention. I must also acknowledge our Workhuman back-office teams - your support over the last 18 months has been the backbone of our success from procurement and legal contracts to finance and administrative champions, your relentless support ensured that every piece fell perfectly into place.  Your collective attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and commitment to inclusivity have not only enhanced our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community but also enriched the experience for every attendee. From the quality of the keynote speakers to the thought-provoking sessions and flawless execution, you all ensured that every participant left with a sense of connection and inspiration.  Thank you, each and every one of you, for your hard work, your passion, and your unwavering commitment to excellence. Here’s to your success and the continued growth of our event as a beacon for business leaders around the globe. Cheers to the entire team behind WorkhumanLive Austin!\n\n46#Creating an experience that resonated|Ladies, what can I say but, 'I see the vision now'. Before anyone else, you all saw the opportunity to bring the HX community into the role of shepherd and representative to the conference experience in a major way. And while I truly made the face that was displayed to the conference and internally felt that you might regret it, you certainly were right. Attendees increasingly came up to share how seen and validated they felt in watching HX take center stage and how invigorated they were to take lessons and the power of their voices back to the workplaces to share with their organizations. I certainly couldn't have created or foreseen the impact this would have on so many and I am grateful that you trusted me to shepherd your vision out to attendees.  thank you so much for what you've done which is to create for everyone there last week the experience and feeling I had at my first Workhuman live. It matters more than you'll know.\n\n47#Who knew it was a scavenger hunt?!|Thank YOU for being part of the Workhuman Live 2024 Scavenger Hunt (AKA - gift card prizes shuffle). There was a plan. It required a pivot. Then another pivot. In a short timeframe. Thank you for keeping an eye on the prize to make sure we give our attendees accurate details in all the places - while educating them about our EComm platform. Cheers!\n\n48#Excellence in Leadership|Taking a moment during the (somewhat) calm before the storm to recognize and thank you both for your leadership.  As we head into the final weeks before Austin, I want to recognize you both for the quiet things you do daily to keep the team motivated, priorities in check, and ensure we offer our attendees the very best experience.  I am grateful to be a part of this kick a$$ team.\n\n49#1 month from today|1 month from today, Workhuman Live 2024 will be over. That means right now you are swamped, probably stressed, maybe losing sleep, keeping track of 100 things. AND building Workhuman Live Forum, wheels turning on a couple Spotlights, plus ramping up Workhuman Live 2025. Its a lot! Keep breathing, doing great work, with FOCUS ;-) on the month ahead. The finish line is coming into view. You can do it. Thank you for your dedication, commitment, and perseverance. Best. Team. Ever.\n\n50#Golden Rolodex|(the image is blurry but it feels appropriate!) Jill - thank you for going to your golden rolodex of contacts to bail out the portable G-Bar this week. Your network is vast and solid, because you build and maintain strong relationships in everything you do. Cheers to you!\n\n51#Dream Team|Just a quick thank you to the WHL team - I had some pretty disappointing news to share on our weekly call yesterday (news I know affects all of your work in some way) and your collective support and response made that so much lighter. Thank you all for truly showing up for this teammate. In the words of Barbie, “I want to do the imagining, not be the idea\" - super grateful I get to spend time doing the imagining with you all!\n\n52#Thanks To My Onboarding Buddies|Today marks my 3-month \"anniversary,\" so I'd like to thank all of you for helping me get off to a great start. You have been kind, empathetic, helpful, and fun to get to know and work with. I still have a lot to learn from you - and everyone - and I'm motivated to rise to the opportunity with you. Thank you!\n\n53#PreGame Partner for success|Jill - I reached out to you for assistance in planning the field sales pregame event to be held the hour before dine arounds this past Wednesday at Activate.  You stepped up to ensure that our constantly growing field sale pregame had plenty of space and time so that the team could spend some quality bonding time together - and you did all of this within 24 hours!  Not the first time you have been a great partner and I am sure it won't be the last!  So appreciated!\n\n54#A boss a leader and a friend|Thank you for being a supportive leader who trusts her team, trusts the process and sets us up for success. For always being a sounding board for ideas, questions, and thinking through any and all hurdles. The events team is so lucky to have you!\n\n55#ACTIVATE Appreciation|Taking a moment to express my gratitude to this incredible group! Each of you contributed to the joy, support and camaraderie I felt at Encore this week. From deepening bonds, making new friends, being a breakouts cheerleader, or trusting the cards process (if you know, you know), I was personally touched by your kindness, teamwork, and trust. Thank you and cheers to an amazing 2024!\n\n56#My Convives|A big thank you for a GREAT event, all the work that lead up to it through the end of last year, all the pieces and parts that were going on during the whole the event and for all the great moments, meals and laughs in between. (I'm still convinced that our team has the most fun)\n\n57#And... we have a Portable!|Jill - thank you for your support as we brought the portable Gratitude Bar to Activate. Your endless patience in answering questions and expertise in booth structures and setups is much appreciated. Cheers!\n\n58#Activate Core (Dream) Team|Team,  What an amazing event! From start to finish, every detail was sweated. Every moment was scrutinized for maximum impact. Every idea and concept was taken to the next-level. Every attendee learning objective was kept at the heart of every decision. The result was our best kick-off event yet, and that's off a tremendously high bar set last year.  Each of you went above and beyond to craft and curate an exceptional experience that will pay dividends for our humans and our business throughout the rest of the year.  Your individual and collective commitment and \"can do\" spirit was inspiring to observe throughout the preparation process and even more inspiring to experience as it all came together.  With much gratitude...Tom\n\n59#Marketing Support|Hi all,  I want to extend my sincere thanks for all your outstanding contributions and all your hard work and support with Marketing over this busy year. Different approvals, requests, queries we have with our Invoices or suppliers’, new vendors onboarding, WH Live Events, you guys always managed to get all this sorted immediately due to your professionalism and the respect for our customers Wishing each one of you a Happy Christmas filled with well-deserved rest and looking forward to another successful year working together.\n\n60#Reorg? More like WEorg!|They say change is hard. Heck, it definitely is.  BUT…. when you’re lucky enough to have a talented, engaged, and supportive group of players in the mix to work through it, together, it gets a whoooole lot easier.     Over the past several weeks, I engaged you all asking for your time and insights to support us collectively working through the “who does what, now?” of it all. Along the way, I’ve been continually impressed with how you all handled the work.  Each of you was clearly driven to make yourselves available amid all the other daily work. What’s more, along the way you all remained consistently engaged, thoughtful, open-minded, and positive in the face of working through the change.   Did we cure cancer? No. Have we solved every little thing that needs to be solved for? No. But we certainly solved for the vast majority of the most pressing aspects of the new “who does what” for our restructured creative teams. That is a major milestone and something we should all celebrate.   Thank you all for stepping up to help get this done, together. Here’s looking forward to starting of 2024 with what, to me, looks to be some of the strongest alignment we’ve ever had regarding how our Marketing creative teams are structured and what work they each support. Upward and onward!\n\n61#Locking It Down|Kudos to this team for crafting an exceptional 2024 leadership events calendar! The meticulous strategizing, calendar planning, and budget allocation per event were instrumental in securing full approval. The comprehensive and cross-functional approach, incorporating stakeholder feedback, consideration of multiple factors, etc. showcased not only this team's professionalism and adaptability but also our ability to move fast and communicate effectively and efficiently -- we've never had a full calendar locked in this early! Thank you for shaping a well-thought-out plan aligned with our business objectives. We're off to great a start. Here's to a successful year of impactful events!\n\n62#Thanksgiving|Jill, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I just want to thank you for all the guidance you provide. You're always there (even when you're busy like today) to answer a question or two (or twenty) and I really appreciate it.\n\n63#Trade Shows|Thank you for welcoming me into the world of trade shows and for showing me the ropes. Your expertise is invaluable and I appreciate the time and effort you put into helping me learn over the past few months. Cheers!\n\n64#Content Strategy & Governance Committee Kickoff|And we're off!  Big thanks to this group for joining the Content Strategy & Governance kickoff, filling out the content questionnaire with valuable insights on content challenges and solves, and for the engagement and enthusiasm about improving content visibility, messaging consistency, integrated planning, content processes - and more!  We're doing big things with content strategy as one team and I'm grateful to each one of you.  Looking forward to continued collaboration in the months to come.\n\n65#Collaborative effort for '24 Marketing Planning!|Thank you team on all your ongoing efforts with the 2024 GTM Marketing planning process these past three months. Because of all your dedication to urgency and vast detail, we are in a fantastic spot for 2024 strategy and budget scenarios. We have taken our learnings from last year, adjusted accordingly from both a preparation and execution standpoint which has allowed our internal processes to continuously improve. You all came to the Integrated workshops ready to collaborate, identify potential gaps, having those healthy problem-solving conversations to build stronger ties and making decisions for a successful 2024. In addition, the technology and headcount asks tied to different scenarios was a big lift in a month’s time and we were able to solidify our business need well within our timeline. Amazing cross collaborative effort, thank you all!\n\n66#WHL support|Thanks to all for your support pushing the Gaylord contract through. Finalizing this contract helps us lock in dates, promotes earlier planning, and saves money! I especially appreciate that I could take vacation and not worry that that the team would back me up and have this delivered on time.\n\n67#UNLEASH World|Team! Thank you for all the work that got us to UNLEASH World. Logistics, goals, technology, creative, all sorts of emails, vendor management, and more vendor management. You brought your skills and dedication to the work; its going to be fantastique because of you. Cheers!\n\n68#I see you|Jill - as soon as you were able to talk about the changes to the creatives moving to Events, I saw you making time for them. Showing your approachable leadership style from day 1, building relationships so your team can remain strong. Asking what they need to succeed, listening so you can support their career growth and the team's success. Proud of you - keep being an exceptional leader.\n\n69#Launching Workhuman's first Star Search!|Sending so much appreciation to this team for the ideas and work put in to launch our first ever internal star search! Kylie - from jumping in on day one (which was also basically your day 1!) and taking the lead, to Jillian and Helly, for your internal comms advice and magic, Jen and Jill, your edits to copy and great ideas for how this search can progress and test, and Amy, for accepting the baton when I was in need of a pass. Thank you all for your teamwork - I can't wait to see what comes of this initiative! Thank you!\n\n70#All About Austin Awesomeness|The alliteration continues.  Thank you to this amazing, accomplished, affable, and admirable team of humans for putting together a great session to educate the sales and customer teams on Workhuman Live 2024.  Your time, attention, creativity and technical skills were both necessary and greatly appreciated!\n\n71#A big thank you for the great conversations!|I wanted to take a moment and say thank you to each of you for meeting with me this past week - week three at Workhuman is in the books! I know everyone's schedules are incredibly busy but it was a pleasure to meet with each of you and gain valuable insights into your roles, your backgrounds & where you live, and how we'll collaborate on WH events!\n\n72#Appreciating YOU!|Jill, I saw this quote and immediately thought of you. Whether it's WHL or me just reaching out with a support question, you approach every project with such thoughtfulness, thoroughness (but never getting bogged down in it), a level of calm I strive to achieve for myself one day, and an attitude and spirit that not only \"gets it done\" but produces something truly fabulous! Most recently, I've leaned on you for a few things, including working through the CAB proposal. You in your typical, amazing Jill fashion, helped us work through ideas and options all in a day's work, even with many other priorities on your plate. I know behind the scenes work is often under-appreciated, for that very reason - the magnitude and effort that goes into creating something often is never truly seen - BUT know that I see you and am grateful. Thank you for all that you do, for being an incredible teammate and expert leader in your field, and for just being YOU!\n\n73#Thank you|Hello all,  Thank you so much for all the collaboration, craic and kindness during my time in WH. You have been an absolute pleasure to work with across marketing, sales and cx where everyone works so hard to do whats right to continue to drive WH to success. Thank you for the strong support of enterprise architecture and at a personal level your tremendous support to me. I would also like to thank Amie Preston who isn't on the system.  Its been an absolute pleasure and I know I will see some of you again :)!!!  Gill\n\n74#Groovy Summer Bash!|Yesterday, over 200 colleagues from Framingham boogied on down to the DeCordova Sculpture Museum to get their groove on and celebrate as one big, far-out crew. A massive shout-out to the party planners for organizing a righteous summer bash that had us all feeling the good vibes. You all provided the perfect hangout spot, groovy activities, and plenty of tasty beverages so we could let loose, reconnect, and dig the scene in a stunning backdrop. You provided the perfect environment for all to reconnect on H1 challenges and epic accomplishments. This crew had all bases covered, from communication to creativity, and from handling logistics to rocking the latest technology. We're all feeling the love! Thank you.\n\n75#Big thanks for quick attention on a busy week!|All, just wanted to say thanks for all your speedy input, yesterday, on the estimate I put together for Richard that mapped out a range of costs for training agencies/contractors on the Challenger sales approach.   While the estimate collab' we did together wasn't a big lift, I realize that squeezing a little side project like that into all of your days is just another \"thing\" on top of all the \"things\", meetings, work, etc.   I still feel \"new\" here and it's really rewarding to be able to get an ask from my boss, work with others quickly to resolve it, and share out a fast/solid output. Thanks for making that easy/effective. It means a lot to me, however small it may have seemed. Thanks!\n\n76#WHL Forum - An Only Workhuman Can Do Event!|Team, I want to express my sincere appreciation and take a moment to recognize you for the remarkable team effort that made the first-ever WHL Forum in London an extraordinary success this week. The energy and dedication you poured into planning and executing this event from garnering 591 registrations, and securing inspiring speakers, thought-leaders in Dan Health, and customers from Sanofi and bp to localizing the event creative, sourcing local entertainers with the “Showstoppers”, and executing a seamless and flawless logistical plan — you were all truly exceptional.   Your passion, expertise, and collaborative spirit showed our mission and values on center stage! We created a perfect balance between knowledge-sharing and networking, leaving everyone feeling enriched and motivated - evident in how we captivated our audience and ignited their passion for creating a positive workplace culture (reinforced with our data) while allowing participants to actively engage, learn, and exchange ideas with their peers.    Your collective efforts helped support our annual business goals by creating an opportunity to engage with 72M in active pipeline across 15 opportunities, 27 customer accounts representing 280M in annual billings, 4 media interviews onsite, and 30 product demos with high-end brands like Rivian, Pearson, Lacoste, and Virgin Media. Beyond the numbers, we created a solid brand reputation in the market. You have all made a significant impact on the success of the Workhuman Live Forum, and I am grateful to have such an exceptional team by my side.   You should all feel really proud of what we accomplished this week! Thank you\n\n77#Flexibility where it counts!|Jill,   I wanted to say how appreciative I am for your 1) willingness to adapt and apply a resource to the Calibrate event, despite the wonky talent assignment history on that project 2) honesty and transparency in the discussion. While the resource is a real win, I also can't tell you how helpful your candor is.   Discussions like that take me leaps/bounds ahead of where I was in terms of really \"getting how it works here\".   Keep being you. If we could all be so clear/honest, I think this whole place would run far more effectively.\n\n78#Leadership in crunch time!|Just a quick note to thank you all for your help, guidance, and leadership during all phases of Workhuman Live. Your direction enabled my team and I to manage the event registration, on-site services, mobile app, and digital activations with clear goals, responsibilities, and a path to success. WHL is no small undertaking and you made sure we were all rowing in the same direction.\n\n79#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.  Your efforts created an unforgettable experience for over 1,500 attendees and reconfirmed our event as the world's leading HR conference.  Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention. Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n80#WorkhumanLive!|Dear Jill, congratulations on another incredible WorkhumanLive San Diego. Your extraordinary leadership and unwavering commitment to improving the event experience year-over-year has truly paid off, and this year's event was nothing short of exceptional. From the new main stage set up and customer celebrations to local entertainment and waffle Wednesdays - your willingness to never settle for the status quo and your talent to execute \"never done before\" ideas is your superpower. Your ability to build trust and strong relationships with your team and senior executives is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and scrutiny of everything that touches this event. It's clear that your team has a deep respect for you and your leadership style, and that trust is evident in the quality of the event you've created - the fact that is truly unique to the geography each year is also a testament to the creative process and partners you've brought together.  You've pushed the boundaries of what's possible with this event, and the result has been a truly remarkable experience for all who attended and the business. I'm so proud of you and all you've accomplished this year. This success is a reflection of your talent, your hard work, and your unwavering commitment to excellence. Congratulations on a job well done, and here's to even more success in the future. London and Austin here we come!\n\n81#Breakout support success!|Jill, first I want to express my gratitude for your work in masterminding yet another thoughtful and successful WHL.   Second, your understanding of the Speaker team's needs, and your willingness to involve us in the selection of our breakout support many months ago, have truly made all the difference.  As Maya and I continue to find our groove, we sometimes face situations where we don't know what we don't know. In those moments, having a vendor like Media Loft, who exudes a sense of cool, calm, and collectedness, has been an absolute game-changer. Jenna, Tara, and the entire Media Loft crew quickly became our people.  It was your early consideration of our needs that allowed us the space to both learn and continue to build out a process that works. For that, I cannot thank you enough.\n\n82#Workhuman Live - One for the record books|A very special note of respect and appreciation for your combined teamwork and leadership.  Workhuman Live is a herculean effort - one that takes the hard work of many, many humans.  We are all lucky to have you both as our leaders in that endeavor.  I am thankful every day that I'm on a team with you both managing all the things.  Thanks for all you do.\n\n83#There is no *I* in \"Events\" nor in \"Spreadsheets\"|Wow!  So while onboarding a new Travel Management Company - which meant all travel for (A REALLY HIGH NUMBER) staff for Workhuman Live had to be booked offline - through multiple spreadsheets and cross checking information - through *many* changes (the Workhuman way!), this team did it.  You are each the consummate professional. One of the best parts of being at Workhuman is being surrounded by talent who not only make you better at what you do, but also lift you up when needed. You exemplify collaboration and teamwork with no ego getting in the way. Thank you for making me an honorary part of this team. I have a newfound appreciation and respect for the effort that goes into making WHL a seamless experience for staff attending.\n\n84#WHL|Tackling the WHL lists has been no easy task. the excel docs upon excel docs. There's no one id rather sit on a friday zoom and go line by line with to make sure we don't miss anything.  this team has handled every hurdle with constant communication and one goal- get it done correctly and produce a quality event!!\n\n85#Events budgets|Jill, want to say thank you for all your time in jumping on calls and replying to emails so quickly and going over the past and future events budgets/spends and also sending in unpaid invoices and all the split and details required in order to have accurate accruals booked on my side. This is a great help to Finance team, highly appreciated.\n\n86#Project Visibility Progress|\"Visibility Matters in the Workplace.\" I see each of you embracing our annual narrative and threading it through your programs. I see you finding ways to incorporate the soon to be final video assets into your plans. I see you being open to different points of view on how and when we leverage the full body of quote, unquote \"brand assets\" in ways we haven't tried before. And I appreciate each of you. Together, we will guide prospects, customers and existing/future employees through the Workhuman journey while helping achieve shared business results. I value the role you're playing in Project Visibility and I'm excited to see this team's great ideas come to life! THANK YOU!\n\n87#Making time|Thanks for making time on this sunny Friday for an unplanned presentation to leadership. With so much going on (as is 'the way it is' this close to WHL) I appreciate you finding time in your day on top of all the deadlines. Cheers!\n\n88#You rang?|Jill, thanks for the quick call on your commute home, to discuss an extra thought... and then some other extra thoughts...😅 Video planning for WHL takes a lot of problem solving and collab. Feels great to be able to partner with you, talk through ideas on the fly, and keep going. Glad you rang, my friend.\n\n89#Putting Work(human) in the Spotlight|Team, congratulations on another really successful Spotlight.  Thank you for your due diligence from scripting and developing the theme, integrating its production alongside Activate 2023, sourcing the speakers, building out the intro and outro's and Q&A for the panelists, facilitating the questions for \"Human's on the street\" and for capturing critical and timely workplace perspectives. As a team, we achieved 95% of the goals we set up with remaining goals (meetings) to be smashed over the next 30 days. Overall, you created an amazing experience for the 5000 prospects/customers and optimized the investment. Thank you!\n\n90#DiSC for Leaders|Congratulations to this group for participating in the recent DiSC for Leaders training course. Continuous learning and development is at the core of the Workhuman Values and Behaviors. Thank you for your active participation in the session!\n\n91#Always my anchor|Just a big thank you for always knowing when to check in and reminding me that this chaos we're experiencing is normal! It's the right time. We do this every year. This is the time that we freak out and second guess and the event feels like a big ball of crazy – but then, you give us all a gut check. This is when it all comes together, the pieces land and we glide into another amazing Workhuman Live. As someone who doesn't come from events – even after 8 years of doing it here – the rollercoaster parts still surprise me, but I always look to you and I only worry if you're worried! You remind me that this is fun, not to lean into the madness, but to ride the excitement. My favorite summary of the creative process (pictured) says it best. We're going to make it. It's going to be awesome. I could never do any of this without you.\n\n92#Marketing Target Architecture Heroes!|Hello everyone  Strategy >> Business Capability Map >> Maturity Assessment across Technology, Process, People, Data >>Target Architecture>>Multi-year Roadmap  Thank you to each and every one of you for your engagement, collaboration and excellent inputs into the stages above that have ultimately led to the Marketing Target Architecture and Multi-year Roadmap. We will refine aligning to capacity forecasts to execute in 2023 and drive solid investment planning for 2024 and beyond.  With gratitude and appreciation :)  Gill\n\n93#Leading with Purpose! Activate 2023|Jill, this picture tells a story of the trials and tribulations of planning and executing Activate 2023.   You were exceptional and outstanding in planning and executing Activate 2023.  Your exceptional attention to detail, creativity, and organizational skills were truly remarkable and made the event a resounding success. Your hard work, dedication, and unwavering commitment to excellence were evident in every aspect of the event, from the venue to the seamless flow of activities, to the delightful food and drinks, to Memoir, and walk-on music and everything in between. Every participant was thoroughly impressed and it's awesome to see social blowing up!  You truly went above and beyond to make this event memorable. You have set a new standard of excellence and have made a lasting impact on all of us. Thank you for your contributions and for making this event a huge success. We are proud to have you on our team and look forward to many more outstanding events under your leadership.\n\n94#On site and on point.|Not everyone gets to see the behind-the-scenes sorcery that is an event coming together: hotel rooms, badges, travel arrangements, show flows, and bears, oh my! The company is a lot bigger and it's been a while since we've had a real-live in-person kick off. I know that there are other recognitions flying in for the shiny outcome – and it was a FABULOUS shiny event. But this award is for HOW it got made. This award is for the days leading up and the hours breaking it down. The unshiny work of collaborating with all the teams that get activated (see what I did there??) to put this together. This team is top-notch when it comes to respect and caring, for each other, for the travel weary colleagues flying in from all over, for our onsite agency partners, for the hotel staff and servers, for the teams back in the office dialing in. The 6am call times,  the late night shift from breakouts to tattoos, and the post-event clean up while everyone else was wheeling out their luggage. You never let your exhaustion diminished your service, your care, or your respect – and it is worth calling out on it's own! Thank you!!!!\n\n95#Activate execution at its finest|Team, you did it, it was incredible, and I’m proud to say we’re back!  We concluded Activate 2023 – bringing back an in person sales and customer kickoff after 3 years of hiatus.  I know you all went through months of preparation and planning, dotting “I’ crossing “T’s”, creating virtual, in-office, and in-person experiences, filming and facilitating Differentiator workshops, and more. You executed flawlessly, dealt with challenges without hesitation and ensured all our humans were informed with comprehensive communications throughout the event and fun well-thought-out games that allowed for maximum retention of our strengths. You created in-office experiences, provided an environment for everyone to thrive and engage, and you all put your best selves forward.  Thank you for always upping your game and never settling for the status quo. You did it and did it exceptionally well.  Thank you!\n\n96#Hard work to host an amazing event|Tom, Jen, Jill, Richard & Brittany - I want to thank each of you for the tremendous effort over the past several months to develop, and host, our sales kickoff event. There was a ton of effort to help craft an agenda that help the team walk away inspired and enabled to drive success. This could not have happened without each of you. Thank you!\n\n97#Activate some sort of catchy title here|Each of you helped me through some craziness in the past 2-3 weeks. From making sure I had the proper files, giving me feedback on designs, making sure I knew what was what, answering my 100 questions, getting me assets I needed, breaking down what was needed and where it needed to be sent, keeping me on track….THANK YOU! All of this and your kindness through it helped me get everything done in the timeline it needed to be done in.\n\n98#Upleveled Bites|Jill - At Activate - the food has been amazing! You not only consider the taste, but the presentation, and way each item will be consumed, on top of every dietary restriction. This is one of your super skills that needs to be celebrated. Thankful to have you at the table! Be Bold!\n\n99#leading the way|thank you for leading the way, steering the ship, trusting your team, and all the things that you do that wouldn't fit into one award box.\n\n100#Activate Leadership|Jill - as we close in on Activate I want to thank you for your leadership on this event. The Events team inherited this one partially cooked and you embraced it like you always do. You 'activated' the team and absorbed/managed all the changes in scope at every step. Never accepting mediocre, you drive us to do better on every thing, every day. True mentor and leader. Cheers to you!\n\n101#Better Together!|Jill, as I head to San Diego on a site visit and look ahead to April, I also look back at the past year and cannot thank you enough for your partnership.   The past year was one to remember for sure, from leadership changes, role changes, the return of in-person – and all the uncertainty that came with it.  At every turn, every decision to be considered, you are there with me in the fight. You bring a clear and thoughtful approach, with impressive foresight, to help ensure we head on the right path.  Thank you for all the collaboration, occasional bitch sessions, and true partnership in driving the amazing results our events do.  We’re better together!\n\n102#Always keeping things moving|Thank you for being on top of everything, helping move it all along (i mean literally everything), working on what is supposed to be a well deserved vacation and just being the best boss! Looking forward to seeing everything come to life in the new year!\n\n103#Nevertheless|...she persisted. I was appreciating Lisa and her focus on Events (including process ;-), when I realized this is the first time we've had a dedicated, truly dedicated, CD of Events. Jen and Liu had the title but always with other competing priorities. You championed for this role for... years. Thank you for your persistence - identifying the need and defining this important role. Cheers!\n\n104#Making the Impossible, Possible|Marketing team and partners - Congratulations on achieving a monumental milestone of 50,000 Marketing Qualified Leads! By the numbers, this milestone represents two-year growth from 8,000 in 2020 to 50,636 (and climbing)! That’s an incredible 532% increase in demand growth in just two years' time!     The journey to this massive accomplishment started back in October 2021 with thoughtful and intense demand and brand planning, pragmatism of breaking big goals into smaller channel by quarter forecasts and plans, followed by superior discipline around performance management week on week, and critically aided by our partnerships with Sales Ops, Analytics, and Enterprise Architecture.     From web leads, to webinars, social surrounds, press amplification, Spotlights, and countless hours refining the leads scoring and ingestion models, this was a department wide effort through and through. As impressive as this achievement of goal (ahead of schedule) is, more than the outcome itself, it’s demonstrative of your collective discipline, collaboration, and commitment to quality execution. We’ve learned much from this journey that will inform and enable success in fy23 and beyond.     On behalf of the Senior Exec Leadership Team, congratulations on making the impossible, possible!    -Tom\n\n105#Big Impact|Jill & Jeff -- Congratulations on WHL Atlanta being named into the 2022 Most Innovative Conferences. It's well-deserved recognition directly linked to your hard work, leadership, vision, and sound execution. This event continues to have an incredible impact on the HR community and it’s really great to see the impact it continues to make within the events community. Well done!\n\n106#Straight on to San Diego|Thank you all for jumping in during my first week and taking time out of your busy schedules to talk to me about all things WHLSD. It has been invaluable to get your perspectives, insights, and historical knowledge as I get up and running in my new role. Looking forward to partnering with all of you as we continue to build towards San Diego in April!\n\n107#Representing|Thank you for representing the Events PM role during recent 2023 Planning and Process Improvement meetings, and making sure my POV was in the room. Of course that included listening to said POV in advance ;-) I appreciate your time and commitment to making the way we work even better. Cheers.\n\n108#Strategic Planning ROCKSTARS!|Team,  Van Gough once said \"great things are done by a series of small things brought together.\" Each of you brought your ideas, your energy, and a spirit of collaboration to the strategic planning sessions this week, which will unequivocally set our marketing organization up to do great things in 2023. It was a large commitment of your time and your active engagement with the goal of developing a collective and transparent foundation for next years plan. So, a sincere thanks to all for both making that commitment and demonstrating that together we can, and will continue to, deliver as a true team.  Tom\n\n109#Quality all day|Jill, thank you for all your efforts planning a packed and productive site visit. Mission accomplished, we have 3 excellent choices for an important dinner, and back up options for all the other events within the WHL event. Plus a good sense of the convention center. Many small steps were taken in this big first step to April. Cheers!\n\n110#Part 1: Plan the Work|Part 2: Work the Plan. Excited to celebrate and recognize this cross-functional group's efforts as we exit Q3, head toward Q4, and chart a path to more growth in 2023. You've all together demonstrated great teamwork, autonomy, leadership, healthy challenge and debate, and a disciplined and data-driven approach to 2023 draft plans which will ultimately be vetted with partner teams to form the basis for strong operating plans aimed at New Customer Growth, Customer Retention, Innovation, and an ongoing focus of putting the human in Workhuman. Congrats on great progress in Part 1. Excited to finalize it and head toward Part 2! -With gratitude, Richard and Chris\n\n111#Bringing your A-game!|Jill, what a great week! You inherited a new team, presented a new approach for SKO 23, and shared an updated own-able event asset proposal (Grat Bar On The Go) with “flying colors”. You were on top of your game, you did the due diligence, considered all the options, and were prepared for the presentations. Thank you for leading by example and for bringing your best to ever conversation.\n\n112#2023 Strategy Session #1|Team - thank you for spend the afternoon together in an engaging discussion around brand, content and comms strategy. While we didn't get through the entire agenda, I am grateful for the sharing, learning and dialogue that took place. Your input will help shape future sessions as we continue through this journey, building stronger ties between our respective teams and making decisions that help us operate more efficiently and move the department and ultimately, the business forward. I hope you're as energized and excited as I am about making more progress over the next several weeks to finalize our strategic marketing plan for 2023. THANK YOU ALL!\n\n113#Weekend dig for photos|Late Friday we learned from Sanofi that they wanted to hear our ideas for recognition and their sponsorship of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Tom, you had the brilliant idea of a co-branded gratitude bar, which led us to looking for inspiring images. Knowing our proclivity for photos, I reached out to the crack WH Live team on Saturday morning, and winning pics were found. We used the images Jill and JenP that you dug up and sent, with feedback \"you 100% met the brief in terms of the Olympic brief\". The speed and urgency that this team responded was critical in pushing us closer to becoming a client. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to act with urgency. It mattered!\n\n114#Pfizer Customer Story!|30 days ago we made a decision to capitalize on an incredible customer story opportunity with Pfizer. We’ve gone from brief, securing a senior Pfizer executive, main story production, capturing user testimonials from a myriad of people across their org to building relationships over dinner in NYC and final asset editing ..... all in under 30 days. Thank you for your commitment to our customers, for making decisions promptly, and for collaborating cross-functionally. This is all in service of ensuring that we maximize the business impact of the relationship and the created asset. We’re going to have such a great asset for marketing, customers, and sales in the future and your collective leadership made this all possible. Thank you!\n\n115#Partnering Across Teams|It has been wonderful working with you on some recent projects - from event planning software to hotel management. Your effort in creating more cross functional collaboration to streamline processes and manage resources more efficiently will not only save time and money, but it also adds so much value to the company culture. Your input - and candor - on some internal processes is already leading to change. Thank you for being open, collaborative, and creative.\n\n116#Spotlight Q3|As we finalize the final final final edits of the spotlight talk show, I want to recognize the collective effort of this team. From the theme development, run of show creations, script writing, speaker sourcing and selection, project management, show production, technical tests, show video edits, marketing promotion, internal viewing party activation & comms to all the areas I’m not even aware of. You’ve planned the work and worked the plan so the final show is going to be great and you should all be proud of what we’ve delivered. Now, let’s go execute it on Tuesday! Oh, we've got 7K+ people registered! Let's go.\n\n117#Beating a deadline|Thank you for reviewing the Spotlight footage and adding your feedback before the deadline. I see you. I appreciate it. Cheers!\n\n118#Yesterday|Yesterday was a rough day. Especially for most of you who may have had flashbacks of March 2020/San Antonio. You put your heart into building an event. The decision to postpone is not an easy one even if the data tells you want you need to do.  Today you refocussed, on San Diego. Tomorrow and the next and the next - you will pour your heart into leading future Workhuman Live events. I see your dedication to producing nothing but quality events and experiences for attendees. I applaud your courage and leadership in doing what is right for the business. Thank you for communicating to your teams quickly and fielding many questions around next steps. Ready for San Diego!\n\n119#dream team!|no one else i'd rather jump on a last minute call with and get our \"ducks in a row\".\n\n120#Lights! Camera! Action!|Jen and Jill, thank you both for organzing an incredible shoot today at Cramer for WH Spotlight. From pre-production planning to script writing to on the ground advisory roles. Nailing this really difficult and nessary topic is naunced and requires both productive excellence and strategic narrative excellence - you gave Workhuman the best chance at acheiving and capturing both of those today! Great work\n\n121#Cheers to our First Global Workhuman Partner!|Team, THANK YOU for being a part of closing our very first global partner at Workhuman: Qualtrics!  Each of you played an essential role in helping throughout this partnership journey.  Your help brought us to where we needed to be, which included: shaping the story, advising on the process and people that need to be involved, coordinating the meetings, bringing our unique value and capabilities to life through presentations, creating a memorable experience for them, providing technical guidance, and formalizing the partnership through contract.  This partnership is the first of many, and the hard work begins here.  I couldn't have done this without you.  As I arrive at my first anniversary at Workhuman, I feel blessed to work with an amazing group of individuals (who also happen to be a lot of fun!).  Thank you again! 🥂 #WorkhumanTogether\n\n122#So if you do the math....|we just bought ourselves 80 hours. I like that ROI. Thank you for investing in the planning process and each other this week. It may feel like we barely scratched the surface, but there were a lot of good discussions and new ways of thinking over our two days together. We have lots to dig into together but I'm excited! I appreciate being on this journey with this team. Thanks again!\n\n123#Turning vision into value|From when I started 2 months ago until now, each of you has been instrumental in laying the framework for the evolution of the Executive Forum. Your leadership, advice, and trust in me in such a short time has been humbling and is deeply appreciated. As a group, thank you for your overarching leadership and strategic input throughout my tenure thus far as we begin to harness the potential of the Exec Forum and shape it into an effective tool for achieving our business goals. Individually, I have been moved by:   Jill, Jeff & Richard – your fearless leadership, patience, flexibility, and guidance along the way, when your plates are beyond full. You continue to rise to the challenge every day, and it is inspiring to watch.  Eileen, Jen R, Tom & Celia – your vision and commitment to the success of the Exec Forum as witnessed by your strategic feedback and mobilizing outreach by your respective teams   Chris & Chase – your steadfast commitment to keeping things moving forward, positioning Workhuman at the forefront of thought leadership, and capitalizing on the momentum built in Atlanta  Amy & Jen P – your strategic and creative feedback, guidance, and mentorship in the moments woven between the To Do List items  Kathryn & Abby – your innate ability to collaboratively help me turn vision to value within your respective roles while simultaneously juggling your numerous other responsibilities. I am grateful for your time and for showing up and prioritizing the Exec Forum  Though we are just getting started together, we have already made great strides - which is cause to celebrate. Thank you for all that you do. Here's to the next phase!\n\n124#Atlanta, Nailed It|Jill, Jeff –I want to thank you both for your unbelievable leadership, planning and execution of Workhuman Live Atlanta!  I have to say it felt incredible to be back, and throughout the entirety of the week I was reminded of just how far we’ve come, in no small part to your tireless dedication and collaborative teamwork to get us to this point.  From registration – “hugging” that forecast line every step of the way, to the planning, pivoting, and replanning of our space utilization, activations, and COVID safety measures and protocols in the ever fluid environment we still find ourselves in, to the seemingly flawless execution of registration (!) this was a banner event from start to finish and I’m so thankful that you were both at the helm guiding us back to in-person reality.  You have now set a new bar, but I have no doubt you’ll not only meet but exceed in the Workhuman Live events to come.  Well done and thank you again for all of your incredible work, and now onwards to Dublin and San Diego!\n\n125#WH EMEA  in Atlanta|Wendy & Jill , i want to say thank you to both of you for not only the amazing Workhuman live 2022 and all the work that went into it, but also for the support and advice that you proovided me along the way. Im well aware of the mammoth volume of work that goes into executing these events. I  had about 40 people travelling to Atlanta from Dublin who had many questions and queries and you made yourselves availble and helped with any queries i had to reassure the Dublin team. Not ony that, but you also provided me with contacts for  a coach big enough to transport our jolly crew back to the airport safely and helped make that a painless process by giving us use of a room to store our luggage until the bus arrived. This was such a help to me &  the Dublin team as they could go do some gift shopping or grab some food after the final Keynote and not worry about dragging luggage around, which was a nice end to their trip.  Thank you both for everything! what a week.\n\n126#It takes a village|Corina and I want to thank all of you for everything that you did for us to make the partner community have a successful and amazing experience at Workhuman Live!!  From all of our last minute questions, details for the executive forum, attendee follow ups, conference room prep, ticket questions and more... you were all so extremely helpful and supportive.  We appreciate all of you for your hard work, positive attitudes and attentiveness to make great happen for this community.  Thank you for everything and more!\n\n127#The Me for the We|Congratulations on a remarkable WHL Atlanta! Transparently, I struggled with this recognition as no amount of words would accurately summarize how I feel about each and every one of you. So, I’ll keep it short. Good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We. Your leadership throughout the planning and execution of WHL Atlanta was on show in full force and everyone was witness to its greatness. Your impact on the Workhuman business is immeasurable. Your collaboration and communication in good and tough times were timely and evident. Your impact on 1,500+ people was visibly life-changing (evident from “ugly cries to ugly laughs” and the glowing smiles throughout the event).   In the famous words of Nelson Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done!” I'm super proud of you.\n\n128#A masterclass in leadership...|I want thank you all for your impeccable leadership. Although this was my first year leading registration, badges, check-in, and returning to in-person events for the first time in 3 years, you all showed poise, trust, and compassion through what can only be described as a tumultuous process. In my 10+ years with Workhuman, this was the most confident and supported I’ve ever felt taking on a new project, especially one so publicly visible. You led me through all of the checks and balances and answered what I estimate to be north of 10,000 questions along the way. Every interaction was based on ensuring not only the success of the event but my own personal success and I cannot express how much this has meant to me. Even when tensions were high and frustration got the better of me, you remained focused on the goal and even justified the need for frustration at times. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for not only your help and guidance, but for allowing me to bring as much of myself into this event as possible. I have no doubt that we will continue to accomplish great things as a team and I look forward to taking on the next challenge, together!\n\n129#Got a minute? Or two hours?|Jill, I can't thank you enough for all the phone calls. The gut checks. The 'do you have a minute' replies and insightful thoughts back. You are all knowing on Workhuman Live and as I embark on attending my first event, I depend on you and you deliver. Thank you x100.\n\n130#All things WHL|THANK YOU so much for keeping the EA team in the loop on all things WHL. The entire team will be experiencing the event for the first time, and I appreciate all of your support in walking us through it step by step! #teamwork\n\n131#Dream Team!|Jeff and Jill - This is long overdue but no less important as you both continue to shine each day as leaders and mentors. I appreciate everything you've both done to get the ball rolling on the 2022 Executive Forum and to bring me up to speed over the past month. The ExF portion of WHL is complex and requires immense attention to detail, and you kept things moving so that I could transition into my role a seamlessly as possible. From preparing key transition and event-specific documents to making time for countless \"do you have a few minutes to talk about X?\" meetings, it means so much to be on the receiving end of your support and advocacy as I prepare to take the ExF to the next level. Thank you also for the warm welcome in Framingham this past week and for making me feel like I was part of the team from the moment I walked through the door. The influence of your combined leadership of our team is evident in all aspects of our work and group dynamic. I feel so fortunate to have landed here.\n\n132#IBM “Man On The Street” Shoot|Wow! What an incredible team effort. We’re so incredibly proud of you all and what you’ve achieved. You developed the scripts, planned and executed the “Man on the Street” production at IBM, collaborated with a variety of internal stakeholders and our IBM client, overcame significant timing and execution challenges on the ground, and more. Importantly, you represented Workhuman exceptionally well and created high-quality and high-impact work for the Workhuman business that thousands of people will see and love!   The impact of this work will have a long-term and outsized impact on our business and relationship with IBM. Thank you for representing the Workhuman values to the fullest. We can't wait to see the final product at WHL.    Ro, Chris, and Richard.\n\n133#A Well-Rounded View|Jill, Where do I start?!  Many thanks for all your support as we work through (and to!) Workhuman Live.  It must seem like Groundhogs day the number of times I ask the same question only to double- and triple-check I'm not missing anything and that I can be as mindful as possible on your side of the world!  You have been so patient.  Also, thank you for being so thoughtful, especially in helping us think through and inform us on other areas that may be important for us to keep in mind as we near WHL.  We don't know what we don't know.  You provide a thoughtful and well-rounded view into both of our worlds.  Thank you again!\n\n134#Best team!|Im so grateful to be able to take some pre-baby time away and know this team not only supports it but has everything covered while I’m gone. I know its a crazy time and I just wanted to say thank you!!\n\n135#Spotlight Success|Team – what a massive win on today’s Workhuman Spotlight event!  It was an absolute thrill to watch it.  Thank you for the ingenuity and reimagination that went in to concepting and planning this new ‘talk show edition’ format, and for all of the detailed execution that went into todays broadcast.  You all nailed it!  From audience acquisition, to garnering fantastic talent for the show, to the ‘on the Streets of New York’ segment which I thought was a hit, to the carefully constructed questions and content to highlight the many opportunities and challenges facing HR today, not to mention the flawless streaming, it all came together extremely well and showcased our natural place as thought leaders and drivers of this important ‘future of work’ conversation.  Steve – you handled the job of navigating the conversations with Laurie, Steve and yes, even the unscripted Gary Vaynershuk too, like an absolute pro.  I’m excited about the demand this event will undoubtedly drive in the final weeks of Workhuman Live Atlanta registration, and equally as optimistic about our prospects for more Spotlight events and format testing in the future.   Thank you to this cross-functional team of trailblazers and innovators, and congratulations on a fantastic event!\n\n136#Pivot to Taking Action|Plans change and we pivoted to action. Last week, we had a request for a gratitude bar at WHL and within 5 days this team produced 3 options with renderings and activations pros / cons. Thank you for actioning this so quickly, for considering operational/logistical/ experiential nuances, and for producing a viable option for approval.\n\n137#Interviewing Across the Aisle|Team, I just wanted to thank you all for helping me interview a wonderful candidate for my open role. The position is one that straddles the aisle between the events world and the world of marketing technology, making the interview process all the more difficult. Without hesitation, and in some cases, at the last minute, you all jumped into action and provided me with great feedback. We'll be welcoming Nicole to the team in a few short weeks and I'm positive we've found a wonderful addition to the Workhuman team. Thank you!\n\n138#Spotlight + Live = magic|Jill, you consistently make amazing, timely and data-based decisions that help me move my goals forward related to Spotlight and Workhuman Live. Things with my team are constantly changing and it has required us to pivot, as more questions and ensure things don't break. It also requires a great partner in your self to ensure knowledge is shared, passed down and kept current. We have a lot of late night talks to ensure we manage proper execution and I appreciate you. Thank you for keeping us honest, on track and aligned to hitting our goals!\n\n139#Spotlighters|You are not the ones on stage. You are backstage working to make the spotlight shine on our speakers, guests, content, message, brand - all the things. Workhuman Spotlight - talk show edition is 2.5 weeks away. The recording is done. The work is far from done. I see you, working on this on top of your other work and our other events (Hello? Atlanta!). You are right on your spot doing what is needed. Thank you for your dedication, stamina, and commitment to the events, the team, the business. Cheers!\n\n140#In the Spotlight|Team, Wow! The Spotlight shoot today was amazing. As a team, we spoke a lot about due diligence and dotting our “i’s” and crossing out “T” and today you proved that we did exactly that. We captured incredible content from well prepared speakers alongside a world class crew. It’s our collective effort that will allow this content and our message to spread across the world! Thank you for dedication, focus on quality, and commitment to getting us to this point. Proud moment. #progress. Thank you\n\n141#Preparation = Progress|Team, thank you for preparing the WHL presentation for my meeting today with Eric. It’s the preparation, the educational / context setting calls/texts/slacks that give me the confidence to represent the vision (with the details). We’re building momentum and these are critical updates for the business and how we progress forward. Thank you\n\n142#WHL ELT Update|Jeff and Jill, I’m really proud of how you prepared and communicated the WHL operational and registration update to the ELT. Internal custumers are critical in the success journey and these opportunties provide us an environment to learn and gather feedback. Congratulations on a successful update and for absorbing the feedback (which we’ll action). Well done!\n\n143#Stepping up and leaning in|Jill, thank you for always being there.  Every day (even the weekends), I see you working harder than ever on the many events we have in flight.  You’re leading teams and agencies, leading speaker plans, negotiating contracts, managing budgets, scenario planning, creating internal alignment, recruiting for open roles, and so much more.  If there is a gap – you’re quickly trying to find a solution.  And throughout it all, you’re aware of everyone else on the team, checking in, and generally being both a good friend and colleague.  You exemplify what leadership is in so many ways and we are all lucky to have you on this team.\n\n144#Spreading the Live love|Jill, thanks for joining our team meeting and sharing all the goodness about Workhuman Live and Spotlight. The earned and owned opportunity here for our team is massive and so exciting. The briefing helped set the stage - thank you!\n\n145#Thank you!|Thank you for all the leadership and support- especially over the last few weeks navigating all that is to come.\n\n146#Integrated Planning Presentations - ON POINT!|Lauren - thank you for sharing the latest brand health survey results with the integrated planning team today. Lots of good insights and discussions. Jill - thank you for getting everybody up to speed on where we are at with the Q1 Spotlight online event. I know there are a lot of moving parts and more questions than answers at the moment but it was important to get us all on the same page so we can properly support this important initiative. Well done to both of you!\n\n147#WHL Resilience|Team, planning an in-person event in our current global environment is very challenging. Today, you presented a solid plan to Eric with a clear action plan to move our WHL planning forward. Thank you for staying flexible and focused and for tackling uncertain times with productive mitigation plans and net new ways of working with scenario plans. You’re working outside of your comfort zone, building trust internally, and managing communication exceptionally well. Be confident we’ll find a solution and we’re on track to producing the best WHL ever.\n\n148#Make Way for Jill|There you are, leading; Nice hat! Over the past 2 days you have brought the team together multiple times to strategize and ideate and brainstorm and document and think think think. You know the world of events requires agility and courage and decision-making. You know the team is tired of Covid and the nonsense it brings (to work, and life... and to our event). You rallied us to get creative and charged us with 'no downers'. Thank you for facilitating and leading the group to come up with multiple options and paths forward; energizing and lifting us up. You are strong. Well done!\n\n149#Reimagination Engineers|The world is unprecedented and this team was challenged to reimagine options for Workhuman Live to ensure that we are able to deliver the experience, content and feelings of our flagship event to meet the needs of the unknown.  Over the course of two days, this group dropped everything to strategize the best options to move ahead.  I think the team came up with truly thoughtful ideas.  No matter how it takes shape, I'm confident our event bring down the house.  So proud to work with this group of humans.\n\n150#jumping lanes|Almost all of the time I disagree with jumping roles (lanes) because it causes confusion and lack of ownership. This recognition is to applaud you for jumping a lane to step in to land our first celebrity speaker for Atlanta. There is a resource gap and you filled it. Great teamwork and dedication. Well done - this is a big deal!!\n\n151#There is a Superhero in all of us|Blown away again by his team's commitment to dropping everything to come together and use their collective talents to drive the business. Here's to all of you in celebration of teamwork!  When it matters most, we step up, rally the troops, and march right into the battle headfirst. Yesterday was another great example of what happens when you bring great minds together, the sparks fly, the ideas flow and suddenly we have a solution. There is a Superhero in all of us, we just have to put on the cape. Cheers to the team!\n\n152#Thank you for the warm welcome :)|Hey team,   I'd like to cap off my 2nd week at Workhuman by thanking you for being great teammates. You've welcomed me into your processes, patiently answered my questions, and earnestly listened to my opinions. I never thought I could be so comfortable while also drinking from a firehose!  I'm grateful to be working with such a bright, friendly, and hard working group, and I look forward to gaining your trust and delivering epic event experiences together.\n\n153#Most energizing meeting I've had in 9 years!|Yesterday I met with Jen, Jill, Alice, Meghan and Brian to discuss the WH Certified experience at Work Human Live. And I'm not kidding when I say it was the most energizing, productive and fun meeting I've had in years!  Coming from a research & advisory firm with a very corporate, process-driven culture, let's just say that most internal meetings were heavy on the seriousness and light on the levity. I continue to be inspired and validated in my decision to join Workhuman just 6 weeks ago, and yesterday’s meeting with you all was a highlight thus far. Excited to collaborate to bring WHC to life in Atlanta!\n\n154#Events is sometimes like|a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Popcorn, toast, and jellybeans. Who needs turkey?! You contribute seemingly simple yet magnificent resourcefulness and problem solving capabilities to the team. And of course what really matters is the people. Thank you to the humans who plan, build, review, deploy, monitor, and report on all the work. I am grateful to be able to work with you. Cheers!\n\n155#Scenario Planning Sesh #1 was what I'd call a Win|My head is spinning from all the inspired thinking in today's planning meeting. Thank you for sharing your Plans on a Page <or is it 'Plan on a Pages?!'> with the broader team. Thank you for deep diving into some of our Marketing priorities to identify integration points, gaps, opportunities for testing, and more. It was awesome to see different people gather to collaborate cross-functionally and spend time thinking about the \"what if sh....scenarios.\" And lastly, thank you for being good sports about the ice breakers questions. From Buzz Lightyear to time machine travel, childhood crushes  and early retirement dreams, I learned a lot of new things about each of you today!  And yet, I am sure you all agree that it felt like we barely scratched the surface in our three hours today. Not to worry! This is the starting point and I have a good feeling that this was just the first of many Scenario Planning sessions to come. So strap in and look forward to next steps AND the next invite. I am excited to work together to ensure we are set up to deliver business results, feel proud of our work, and have some fun along the way.\n\n156#Championing content management greatness|Managing over 100 speakers. At least 56 breakout sessions. 8 keynotes. All from Excel spreadsheets, sharepoint sites and file sharing services is......cumbersome and can be more of a bottleneck as we look to scale our events. Thank you all for helping to champion a content management system for Workhuman Live to better scale, grow and manage all the content for this big bet. It's only going to help us show up better for attendees, which is vital. After all, what's an event without some amazing content!\n\n157#Sometimes it takes a village...and tequila.|Team – thank you all for helping to bring the Texas Tequila Talks event to life last week. Alana, Katie, Rachel, and Anthony, thank you for your great work on the design and development of the assets/invites. Dianne, thank you for overseeing and managing the project and timelines so smoothly. Scott, Meisha-Ann, and Omar, you lead an amazing presentation and discussion, thank you for hosting. Beth, Lori, and Phil, thank you for your support and for facilitating invites to key contacts to ensure we had an engaging group at the event. Chris and Melissa, I appreciate your help in coordinating our customer presenters, allowing attendees to hear firsthand their experience with Workhuman. And finally, Jill, Melissa, and Wendy, without you, there would have been no tequila (or event at all). Thank you for being so organized and for driving all the planning and logistics of the evening. As you can see, it was a true team effort, and I look forward to planning more great events like this in the future. Amazing job all!\n\n158#What an amazing team!|A huge shout out to Jill, Jen, Mark, Jeff & Melissa who made this week’s Atlanta site visit with Sparks a true experience! While this may have felt like “old hat” for many of you, this was a first for me and I was blown away by the level of expertise, thoughtfulness, partnership, collaboration, comradery and energy that every human brought into the process. It made the trip so unique, successful, and of course fun! Each of you brought a lens and level of detail that was critical to the mission. And on top of everything else, you made me feel like part of the team, no matter what my question, observation, or idea was. THANK YOU!!! I can’t wait to continue to play my small role in the evolution of WHL 2022. Please know how much I appreciate each of your contributions. YOU all are what make this event so phenomenal!\n\n159#So much more than a team!|I need to tell you all how very grateful I am to work with you each day.  The past months have been somewhat of a rollercoaster for me (big surprise, right?).  I’ve been well off my game, reactive instead of proactive, triaging instead of being well planned.  It’s not the way I prefer to work, but have found myself there all too often due to the external struggles I have been managing.  And throughout it all, you have been there to have my back.  Always with a ‘don’t worry, we’ve got it’ attitude and helping hand.  I couldn’t do it without you, and am so thankful for your never ending, never questioning support.  I’m lucky to have you on my team, and look forward to having the chance to offer back even a fraction of the help and support each of you have given.\n\n160#Hired!|Team, thank you all so very much for your time, focus, and thoughtful feedback as we searched for a digital event experience manager.  Each of you provided such wonderful feedback throughout the process, and maintained great focus on helping us find the right fit for our team – even with so many other demands on your attention. We had a few starts/stops, but ultimately, we found a fantastic candidate in Alex.  He has officially accepted the role and will join our team starting Nov. 22nd.  I cannot wait!\n\n161#The goal is progress, not perfection!|“First steps are always the hardest but until they are taken the notion of progress remains just a notion and not an achievement” — Through a time of transition, new planning processes and forecasts, and current executional needs this team has been exceptional. You’ve come together, forced needed changes, asked the right questions, and most importantly you’ve done it as a team. Thank you for leading by example, overcoming the daily challenges, and for accepting new perspectives and approaches.   You are building our game plans now so we can all enter the stadium with confidence together next year.   Remember, The goal is progress, not perfection\n\n162#The A Team|A huge shout out to this team for consistently being the foundation to the cross-functional group that produces the company's most coveted event (and then some). Whether it's putting in the work upfront with the overarching strategy or the oh-so-many details to follow, it's truly remarkable that less than 10 people keep it all afloat and moving downstream. It's been an honor to be in the trenches with you and I thank you for always supporting and teaching me along the way. I can't wait to see all that you'll accomplish next year but this is an appreciation post for all that you've done and overcome thus far. Sincerely, your biggest cheerleader.\n\n163#Captains of the Events Ship|Jill and Jeff - thank you for steering the (enormous) ships of executing the digital Spotlight event at the same time as launching the registration and promotion of Workhuman Live Atlanta.  One event alone is a significant task, but you were leading the execution of both at the same time.  Thank you for your leadership and direction so the team could execute on our objectives.  Could not be more proud to work on a team with you leading the way.\n\n164#And thats a wrap!|Thank you for bringing your brilliance, remarkable talents, expertise, creativity, innovative thinking, and skills to drive the successful execution of the Spotlight broadcast and WHLive registration launch.  The work for these projects starts months in advance and continues for weeks after we go live. Over the last several months, there were endless moments of comradery, collaboration, and a continuous drive to raise the bar.    The road was challenging, but despite the obstacles, YOU DID IT!  You delivered a fabulous production and flawless launch.   Your passion is contagious. Congratulations and celebrate the moment!!\n\n165#Workhuman Live is LIVE|Team, we’ve done it again!  After months of planning and hard work, we’ve launched Workhuman Live back in the market, back to LIVE.  Running parallel to Spotlight was no small feat, yet this team was up to the task.  Every one of you has contributed in so many ways.  From initial messaging and look books, to web designs and creative assets, writing of all the words, and getting the legal-ese just right – Live slowly came together for the market.  Emails, media, social, and enablement are all launched, and registration is doing its thing to capture and confirm our early adopters.  We’re just at the start (yes – 221 days to go) – but I am so proud to work with this team committed to excellence and success every single day.  Well done all!\n\n166#Wow....that was awesome|Jill, Yesterday's broadcast was just awesome!  Congratulations to you and the entire team.  And while I was not close to the daily details this time, from experience, I know that success here is a team effort, and you are ALWAYS a central part of that team.    Major kudos to you and the entire team!\n\n167#digging into the deets!|Thanks for taking the time to walk me through some of the excels, processes, and all the things. I love details and appreciate another great 1v1.\n\n168#Spotlight content partner in crime|Jill, I so appreciate your partnership in pushing Spotlight post event content plans through. We really worked to bring some new thinking to the program to increase MQLs and get people to think differently. Outcome may not have been what we wanted, but I think we are chipping away at moving the needle. Thank you for realizing the value, understanding where we need to go and helping promote this effort to our peers. This is only the beginning.\n\n169#R2 - 2 days early!|Team - thank you for delivering a great final Spotlight show two days ahead of schedule this Friday! It looks great and allows the tech teams more time to test and perfect the broadcast! With gratitude, -C\n\n170#\"IRL practice\" for a \"Virtual success\"|Team - Outstanding to see all of you come together today to conduct final prep and plan for our Oct 6th Spotlight Broadcast. It is clear you all are laser focused on a great experience for our customers. Keep up the great work! With gratitude, -C\n\n171#R1-derful|Team - I appreciate your great teamwork and speed to deliver the \"R1\" cut of the Spotlight broadcast ahead of the scheduled weekend delivery last week. You accelerated well, and were proactive in communicating a new, earlier deadline for video delivery and review. Thank you for helping give time back, and creating more capacity for the final stages of testing. I appreciate that. Please share this with the Sparks team as well as they played an important role but are outside of our Spark recognition platform. With gratitude, -C\n\n172#Spotlight Experts|We took the Product Segments work in house. And what wouldn't we? You are the experts in our Products, our Brand, our Voice, our Message, our Data, our Stories. Thank you for adding this important work to your plate; finding time, making time, juggling, and giving it your best. Cheers!\n\n173#Presenting ... Workhuman Spotlight|Team - Thank you for your important contributions to our upcoming Progress Meeting discussion on Workhuman Spotlight. Your teamwork in creating a crisp and succinct overview of strategy, run of show, promotions, and tech plans is appreciated. I'm excited about the plan we have to share, and look forward to co-presenting with Mark and Jen next week. With gratitude, -C\n\n174#Lighting Up Spotlight|Team - I want to recognize and say thank you for a great rally meeting yesterday to make sure we maximize the best-in-class solutions we are emphasizing and driving with the Spotlight Broadcast. Focus areas like Conversations and Service Milestones are critical path for companies that want to overcome The Great Resignation, pandemic-driven culture decay and deterioration of relationships, and the need to build back culture amidst distributed and dynamic work. Keep pushing! With gratitude, -C\n\n175#The Final Countdown|The Band was Europe and the song was “It’s the Final Countdown.”  Here’s to the Band that pulled the Spotlight broadcast launch together. Following months of preparations, the official launch hit the streets on Wednesday and the registrations are rolling in. Congratulations to all of you for the effort, creativity, and teamwork.  T-48 and counting!\n\n176#Setting the tone for what comes next!|WH Live has always had a unique vibe, sense of wonder, and community that is contagious and inspiring. Underneath it all, there are countless people and talent that help bring it to life in so many ways. In the beginning, it’s things like a Look book that set the tone for what comes next and how we will build momentum along the way. This is a super shoutout to the team that pulled it together -from researching the city, incorporating its vibe, designing the graphical elements, and tying it all together to create a cohesive look and feel. Congratulations on a job well done!\n\n177#On-Boarding Thank you!|Jill, Stacey & Jaime - thank you so much for your on-going assistance with getting me (the newbie) up to speed on all things related to Workhuman and our team.  You took time away from your busy schedules to educate me and answer the many questions I've had (and will continue to have) since starting here at Workhuman.  I appreciate your patience and am grateful to have you as teammates!\n\n178#No Ego Leadership|Yesterday there was a meeting about a booth. A booth under pressure to be built on time. A new idea surfaced. I said in my head \"No, it's too late!\"  You, as always, calmly and carefully considered the idea. Considered if it would improve the work, the attendee experience, the brand representation, align with the goals of the event. This is what you bring to Workhuman. Always thinking with the company in the forefront, open-minded, no-ego leadership. It is why the events succeed, and the events team is dedicated again and again even as the twists and turns of pandemic life continue to challenge almost every, single, step. We stay in it because of your leadership. Cheers!\n\n179#Together is Better|Thank you all for being open and sharing your stories during our team meeting. We have a great group of individuals, with tremendous talent and respect for one another. I personally loved learning more about each of you, your journeys, and what matters most in your life and career. You are all amazing people, and I am thrilled to have the chance to work with each one of you. P.S. Only you will know why I selected this photo for the award!!!\n\n180#How many MQLs? By when?!|Team - Thank you for your collaborative and thorough work to develop a 2H marketing leads plan that fully leverages our marketing investments to maximize growth in our business and market opportunity potential for our sales teams in the second half of the year. Terrific work to look at this both from a top down and ground up perspective. We have a solid plan and clear expectations and accountabilities to manage ourselves to in 2H. Well done and with gratitude! -C\n\n181#Presentation Perfecto!|Team - thank you for a terrific meet up yesterday - you all shared great insights, learnings, and actionable takeaways that can be applied broadly across the marketing and sales organizations to help drive our growth! Great questions, discussion, and engagement. Well done. With gratitude, -C\n\n182#WorkhumanLive 2022 - We're on our way!|\"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\" - thank you for making the first step in our 2022 journey start on the right foot. We have a comprehensive and succinct pre-read and strategic framework to take with us into our leader stakeholder alignment session this week. Great teamwork to get it there, and I'm optimistic and grateful for what's to come. With gratitude, -C\n\n183#Thank you!|Jill- thank you for the opportunity to come back to the events team and for all you've handled behind the scenes over the last few months. I'm excited to \"officially\" be back and get things rolling under your leadership in the coming weeks!\n\n184#Workhuman Spotlight!!|Amazing work by this entire team for getting all the things done this week to keep us on track for the October Broadcast!  We have a name, a look book , a kick-butt abstract, a platform decision, and speaker contracts in the works.  We needed to work together to keep things on track and everyone on this team stepped up to get it done and approved.  Thanks for making this a priority and enabling us to go forth into the next phase of planning and promotions!\n\n185#Continued Partnership|Jill, thanks for all of your help in getting a talent agency up and running. You were quick to bring recommendations to the table + getting a SOW and setting up calls for us to go over the details with them. I so appreciate your partnership on this.\n\n186#Advice is greatly appreciated!|Jill, Jess and I spoke with Tim from Downstream today, and he was quite impressive.  Great to have another quality organization to help us think of what an Innovation Center can be, and he has plenty of ideas he will share in a couple weeks. Thanks for taking the time to find him and then set expectations! John\n\n187#Working Human Champions Unite!|I wanted to express my gratitude to this fine team of colleagues who have come together to share ideas, express concerns and TAKE ACTION to help shape the human experience and culture for our Marketing team. Your commitment goes way back to last fall when we formed the original Pulse Survey Groups but we reinvented ourselves about a month ago and decided there is strength in numbers. When you share a common goal and vision, it might make sense to join forces. And, wow...were we spot on. I love the collaboration and get giddy when hearing and seeing the larger group feed off each other's ideas. This group championed the DiSC workshop as our first official all hands L&D opportunity. This group helped reimagine the town hall as a platform to showcase the strong work and diverse voices across all of Marketing. This group is thinking ahead to what the next phase of work, when we step away from our Zoom calls and return to the office in some form or fashion, means for our newest marketers and everyone else that survived the last year+! This group is thoughtfully pulling together strategies to help foster the human connections that will inevitably make our team stronger and our work even better. It's a side hustle when we are all hustled out most days, but it matters and I genuinely appreciate your investment. We've only scratched the surface, but after receiving positive feedback on yesterday's town hall and coming off of a lively planning call with many of you earlier today regarding our next couple of initiatives, I am feeling optimistic about the journey we've chosen to take together. #btpftp THANK YOU for your commitment to me, to each other, to all of Marketing, and to working human!\n\n188#Okay, WOW.|JILL!! You blew me away today. I suggested that if you had any downtime (haha, what's that) that you had access to resumes for your open req if you wanted to browse them and let me know if any jumped out at you as someone I should screen. Hours later you sent me an ENTIRE list of every applicant and whether or not you had interest in the profile. What would have taken me an hour to sift through I will now be able to do in 10 minutes. THANK YOU soooo much for this act of kindness. I am so looking forward to being your partner on this search!\n\n189#Content Crusaders|Amy & Jill, while this seems overdue from the May event, it’s top of mind for me. Coming back from maternity leave, I’m in awe of all the work you both took on to ensure the content at Workhuman Live Online was a success (and it was with a 4.7/5.0 rating!). This is not an easy area to jump into. There are relationships to form, quick deadlines to hit, and many moving parts. Thank you for the time and energy you poured into these sessions in my absence. You’re a huge part of the reason I was able to enjoy my time with baby Jules this spring.\n\n190#WHLO Retro|Thank you for completing the WHLO survey within the allotted timeframe. Your feedback is important to help drive improvements in how we work on future events. I appreciate your time and input. Your voice has been heard. Cheers!\n\n191#Keys to the Keynote|Hey Gang, This year, most of Workhuman Live Online production was tackled by out of house vendors with the exception of Eric's keynote address. Jen, without your artistic brain, and you working directly with Eric and getting the raw direction and feedback, we could never have pulled this off in the short amount of time we had. Jill, not even sure what to say as you are vital and critical to all parts of all things WHLO. None of it happens without you and your hard work and strategic planning. Carrie, you came through in the clutch with assistance on graphics and design as the hyper organized human file cabinet of goodness we all love you for being. Nuvs, you recorded some video of the inclusion advisor to give that section of the keynote a little extra pizazz and you did it, and re-did it in a tight pinch. Jay, you adapted and evolved some production graphics including a fun show opener in the midst of website mayhem. Thank you for making the time. Owen, writing Eric's script and content pretty much consumed your life out of left field for the better part of a whole work week. I know it was very hard on you so thank you weathering the storm and delivering great work in the face of the challenge. Cullen, your first big project for the company and you sa-moked it. You rolled with the inevitable left and right field feedback on anything this large. You brought your original artistic style to the edit and we hit the all the deadlines we said we would. D and Stewy, you were both pivotal in the conversation segment with Ro. Without your hard thoughtful and timely work, there is no chance that section would look as polished and up to date as it does. It was a joy to work with you and I am making the case for more creatived to engage your team on our work. To anyone reading, THIS is is what it sometimes take to make \"a video\". No one can do it alone, so thank you all.\n\n192#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n193#WHLO Exec Forum Goes Digital!|It was a pleasure collaborating with you all on the WHLO executive sessions, boldly going where no WHL exec session has gone before - virtual!  Thank you for your strategic ideas, flexibility and dedication to the success of the sessions.  Thanks also for the timely laughs along the way!  Great work for such an important audience!  Cheers!\n\n194#Fastest keynote|Team, We just launched the second keynote speaker for Workhuman Live Online. You did it in record time. From negotiating contracts, making quick decisions, developing copy and creative, speedy approvals, building, trafficking, launching, coordinating schedules. We even recorded Common's session before we promoted him. That's a first! Common and Zain were prepped for a relevant conversation to close the event and drive home our messaging. Then on to editing. Oh my, so much editing to filter out the best of all the words. It takes a dedicated team of individuals with unique skills to include a keynote in an event. Thank you for your commitment to Workhuman Live. I recognize all the work you do behind the scenes to make it seem... common.\n\n195#BoD time|Jill, the Board of Directors invitations don't fall neatly into any category. Not really Audience Acquisition. Not really Event Production. Not sent through our typical channels. But very, very important. Thank you for owning this work, finding the best way to send them by partnering with our vendor, and staying with the process through tracking to make sure the emails were received. Well done!\n\n196#WE HAVE SPEAKERS!|Ladies, I can't thank you enough for getting us across the finish line. We have our two keynote speakers. You two were fundamental in getting our final keynote speaker and moderator across the finish line. You helped get all our speakers all signed, sealed and delivered. Schedules were coordinated. People recorded. Things changed and then fixed. ALL the emotions that come with getting this finalized. You two. Rockstars. The show is going to be amazing because of your respect for customers and sense of urgency and quality. Thank you so much!\n\n197#Adam Grant In Market!!|What a week for this team.  Not only one WHLO promotional announcement but two.  We kicked it up about 1,000 notches to get Adam Grant negotiated, contracted, copy written, designs done, approvals all around, and in market.  Within just a few days.  This team continues to perform at an amazing level.  Every. Single. Day.  It was a chaotic, frenzied, and yes - sometimes frustrating week.  But everyone pulled together to execute.  Thanks to everyone for the teamwork, urgency and top quality work.\n\n198#Speakers and More Speakers|Almost feels like an in-person event to have this many speakers! Landing so many speakers is a huge achievement in a compressed digital event timeframe. Kudos. A second speaker announcement was not in the plan. But how could we not shout out about more great names and companies? Game. Changers. Even with an extra twist to get a couple of external approvals you launched the assets without delay. Thank you for rolling with the changes and still bringing your best to the work. It is your determination and dedication that is driving registrations. Cheers to you all!\n\n199#Falling from the Sky|On the marketing team call today Chris mentioned how sometimes things 'fall from the sky' in Marketing. Last weekend a big thing fell and you caught it. It was around the most important session of WorkhumanLive Online. Being a seasonal professional on all things events, you knew just what to do. You managed the stakeholders, activated the vendor to adjust the crew's schedule, and worked with the guest speaker to move the recording while maintaining the relationship. I appreciate you, and thank you for catching this one solo. Cheers!\n\n200#The best work is behind the scenes.|I do so many presentations about what is going on with the event, what it will look like, how the ads will appear–but there should be an entire presentation about how these events actually come together. There is so much that you are doing that no one sees, from managing the vendor relationships and contracts, to arranging all the technical aspects of the broadcast–as well as the filming–and so much more than I can list here. You make it look like smooth sailing, but I know how much is going on under the water, the constant juggling, negotiating, pivoting. And amidst all the hub-bub of putting on the event you're also working out how to get locations secured for 2022–because events need to be nailed down SO far in advance–and always thinking of the long-game: the executive briefing center, the future of tradeshows, regional events, how do we get MQLs and big brand awareness that we can measure? You are a unicorn that is part logistic, part financier, part creative, part experiential, and 100% strategic. I can't do anything that I do, without you doing what you do!!!\n\n201#The countdown begins|5, 4, 3 weeks until Workhuman Live Online. I don't know anyone who works on events who sleeps in the weeks leading up to an event. Especially you, being the Event Producer. This recognition is because I see you tirelessly managing our vendor for this event. Working with a new vendor means building and managing relationships, and setting expectations. You do this in your sleep. This event has been even more complex because of shifting dates and weekly changes to promotional campaigns. I appreciate you asking the team for input so you have all the facts to negotiate with the vendor and compromise as necessary to get the work done. You are always exploring options and open to alternative solutions. You excel at vendor management. Thank you.\n\n202#I spy … Cy!|Team – way to go getting all the facets of our Cy Wakeman Host announcement into the market this week.  Every new message in the journey brings with it new challenges, new deliverables, and constant iterations to get it just right.  Working through multiple agencies this time adds layers of reviews, approvals, and forces us all to be much more buttoned up to make it all happen.  From contract to launch, every one of you stepped up to do your part and more, helping deliver over 1200 new registrations since the announcement went into market.  Way to deliver!\n\n203#Live site is Live!|This team! Tremendous accomplishment today in launching WorkhumanLive.com including a new registration platform. We had multiple new vendors, which is a huge lift to get set up and on board. We had few days to build and test. You all worked together, bringing your individual expertise to the work and determination to meet an aggressive launch date. I saw many of you patting your head while rubbing your belly (so to speak). Your dedication and hard work paid off. Humans are registering. Every day counts. I am thankful for this team in getting to Day 1!\n\n204#The Epitome of Working Human|Jill, I can't thank you enough for the support that you've given me over these past months.  I appreciate your mentorship, guidance, empathy and true leadership.  You are a constant source of inspiration and steadfastness to our team.  The expertise and passion that you bring to every project is admirable.  Thank you for all that do for our team and Workhuman!\n\n205#Quality WHLO decision making|Jill, I have officially dove into the deep end on WHLO with you for only one week and you've blown me away with the quality decision making and leadership. I've always heard and known you were a rockstar, only now I get to witness this first hand. Keeping us on budget. Moving many things forward. Not accepting anything but the best from all the team members. Not much else to say other than wow, thanks and I'm looking forward to working this event with you.\n\n206#Speaking of Speakers ...|Jill, Amy - fantastic collaboration and agility this week to secure two prominent personalities that will surely help us achieve our WHL goals. You effectively navigated the crooked and - at times - circular process that is speaker securement. I really appreciated how you acted with a sense urgency and definitiveness. Keep it going as we round out our talent for the event this upcoming week. -C\n\n207#Picture this|Jill - Last week you were given a suggestion to include Cy as part of Workhuman Live in May. Within a day you had an agreement from Cy to participate. Normally it takes weeks to get a speaker signed to an event!  The picture I would like to show in this frame is you and Cy together from one of our in-person events. But as is the case with Producers, you stay behind the camera, racing to manage other things instead of pausing for a photo op.  The reason Workhuman is able to have Cy in the May event is because of the professional relationship you've built over the past few years. She knows you, trusts you, and respects you as the leader of our events. Thank you for bringing your expertise and mindful approach to all of our events.\n\n208#When the rubber meets the road - for an event|It takes a lot of tires. The event dates changed. Within minutes action was taken. Within hours - Vendors were contacted. Logos were created. Assets for marketing and sales enablement were updated and shared. Things were paused. Plans for additional work were developed. Within days - Web pages were updated, email was written, built, and launched, comms were shared, calendars were updated, campaigns were revisited and adjusted. It was a lot of effort by a lot of expert and dedicated humans. Thank you!\n\n209#Raising Live and in life|Jill and Jeff,  Raising Workhuman Live - I've referred to you as the co-parents of Workhuman Live in the past. Jill, you are the Producer who builds the event. Jeff, you bring the people to it. You bring complimentary skills and styles that make 'raising' each event possible. In the past year there have been many changes: event formats, leadership, timelines, vendors, dates. The list is long. You remain the constant. The people the team turns to and relies on for stability, advice, and support. Thank you.  Raising teens - while all that is happening, you are also raising teens. The world is driving in the fog right now, no one knowing what the future looks like. Teens are driving without fog lights. They don't have the life experience to understand right now is temporary, and how to see through the fog. Yet as they end their high school journey, teens are expected to make big life decisions. Parenting through this is hard, and heavy, and happens mostly off-screen. I see you.  The combination is a one-two punch some days. I see you managing it and holding it all together. I see you moving from Live to life and back again. I recognize you, and support you, and appreciate that you show up - day after day after day. Keep being awesome.\n\n210#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n211#\"Experience\" Experts Unite|Wanted to give a shout out to this team for the thoughtful approach, care and attention you put into creating the WH Live session for our integrated marketing planning \"offsite\" later this afternoon. Would have been easy to default to a never-ending PPT deck and 45 minutes of a traditional presentation format, but you took to heart specific feedback and created what I am sure will be an engaging experience for all. Looking forward to it. THANK YOU!\n\n212#Pioneer Squad|Thanks all for either being the first few people to complete and submit the speaking engagements request form in Workfront or for joining one of our first two speakers bureau office hours. Our hope is that the new process is both simple and useful to all areas of the business. You've helped to kick it all off by jumping in without hesitation and asking all the right questions. We look forward to your feedback as we continue throughout the year!\n\n213#Team data|Thank you for spending time this week outside of your current workload to gather historical data to help inform decisions for our future work. I appreciate your time and dedication. Cheers!\n\n214#Inclusive Conversations|Devin and Jill, thanks for the time and energy you put into the first planning session with the agency for WHLO. The team has strong momentum coming off the holiday break because of the work you both put in leading up to these meetings. I greatly appreciate you inviting various voices into the conversation and making the planning process truly inclusive. I look forward to Workhuman’s most impressive event yet!\n\n215#Putting in the work|Team - on behalf of Patti and myself, we wanted to say, \"Thank you\" and recognize the teamwork, collaboration, and effort you've collectively put in to moving our Pulse Survey action plans forward from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Together, we've made great quarter over quarter progress due to your efforts. This is an \"above and beyond\" initiative you've stepped up to lead. In doing so, you are each playing a leadership role for your marketing colleagues and peers - and - making a meaningful contribution to Patti, Tyler, and myself in building an amazing employee experience. This type of work is not the kind you can do \"every so often\" or \"sometimes\" and expect to achieve progress. It takes ongoing focus, a solutions-based outlook, courage and candor to build and sustain a great employee experience. Thank you for putting in the work - we look forward to continued advancements as we turn the page to 2021! With gratitude, -C\n\n216#Event Planning Master|Jill, thank you for organizing and executing the agency RFP for Workhuman Live 2021 and then bringing the team together for the agency reviews.  I know the process was last minute and you did a great job briefing and prepping the agencies for a thoughtful review process.  I especially appreciate you facilitating the discussion for the open and honest feedback on the contenders.  It was impressive to see the work that's being done in the industry and exciting to think about the options we have to consider for Live.  Really looking forward to working with you in the months to come.\n\n217#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n218#Lights, Camera, Action Groups!|Team - Z and I want to thank you all for your work getting the Pulse Survey Action Groups kicked off. Your ideas we so thoughtful and well crafted for the short window we gave you. We are beyond impressed! As Chris said, this is hugely important work and it is ongoing. We are excited to continue our partnership with you as we build and develop out these programs! We are grateful for you all!\n\n219#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n220#Hello, it's me.|I was wondering if... you ever get sick of my emails? Since 2014, when a group of us first started planning this thing... Workhuman, I've created folders and spreadsheets in an attempt to track all the details. Fast forward to 2020 and I realize that was a good idea but would be an attempt at achieving the impossible. I would need humans to help me remember it all. (And, btw... when i say \"ALL\" - I mean the things in my world. Ha!) Well,  those humans are the two of you! Thank you for answering every random email with questions dating back to the beginning of Workhuman time. The latest one will be used in a meeting with new members of LinkedIn's leadership team - including the CHRO! You are the best!!!\n\n221#The O-line of WHLOnline|Jill. When physical events were a thing, I don't think there was a single doubt in anyone's mind much you did, how hard you worked, and how high your bar of quality was. However, in the time of digital events......(where's he going with this)......NOTHING IS DIFFERENT. All your same amazing skills and talents were the offensive line of WHLO20. That means you do a lot of the hard dirty work to make things happen, but are not as often celebrated as such. Well allow me to take a moment and clear that up. You have a unique talent in that with high stakes, large budgets and costs, and complicated interpersonal relationships, you are un-phased. You do not panic. Your ability to stare down intense massive tasks and overcome with quality is translatable to damn near any industry. This company is so lucky to have you and for anyone who may not work in marketing or directly with you, HEAR THAT. Thank you for your work and being you.\n\n222#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n223#Calm and quality under pressure|Jill, as we quickly had to pivot from physical to digital events, I wanted to give you a shout out for never getting rattled and always finding the best solutions for the situation at hand. From agency and budget management (under the tightest of deadlines), to locking down major venues in record time, you always instill confidence in the team, helping to bring unique Workhuman stories to life on all the right stages. Thank you for being the consummate producer!\n\n224#Encouragement for the Journey|I want to thank you all who have been involved in my recent filming for WH Live.   The content of this event is already remarkable, and the logistics of arranging online shoots that cover not only many states, but continents too, must I’m sure be quite a challenge!  But, in working with you all I am inspired by your cool heads, your co-ordinated teamwork, you’re we’ll figure it out attitude, that’s OK we have options attitude…. I am assured that this is going to be great.  So in offering encouragement for the journey, look inside that word.. and I say - have courage!  I am confident the final result is going to be truly magnificent and will inspire many thousands of humans to make work more human.  Thank you Jill, James & Lauren, its always a pleasure to work with you.\n\n225#Looking both ways|We've got less days ahead of us than behind us on the journey to Workhuman Live Online. But there's no coasting downhill for this team. Some of the work is ramping up, some of it is continuing to speed along. You've all been putting forth your best efforts,  and many extra hours. The shared experiences build not only the event but also keeps the department strong. Cheers to you!\n\n226#Crunch Time|Jill, thanks for helping to fill in the blanks and keep us on track when it comes to Sparks and their production requirements and deadlines. We’re handling each interview and video differently, which has added more moving parts. We’re also working with several different schedules and time zones. We’re at crunch time so I know it’s not easy to be making daily changes at this point. I appreciate your flexibility and keeping us aligned with the Sparks team.\n\n227#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n228#Masterful planning|We don’t often work together, but I have to say it’s been “eventful” so far! Being a part of this team who are dreaming up new ways to create classy and engaging experiences while keeping it all virtual of course! You’ve been very thoughtful ensuring you have the right program name, messaging, cadence, budget, timing, gifts, topics, and speakers. Great job thinking through all of these aspects on multiple events/series and working on things that are outside the box! People are eager to connect and take part in the topics you’re going to deliver. Way to make Workhuman a connection point for C-Level audiences. Can’t wait to hear how they go as they start rolling out!\n\n229#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n230#Trusting the process!|Team - thank you for buying into and committing to the new process and approach we're using to develop an integrated and collaborative 2H Marketing Plan (ie., offsite, collaboration, data-driven goal setting, etc.). Because of your willingness to lean into this new way of working we've been able to advance new creative, powerful, innovative ideas for 2H digital programming, virtual engagements, and WHL-S that tap into the zeitgeist, create urgency, represent that Companies that thrive Workhuman, in a way that is unique to our Brand and business. With gratitude, Chris & Patti\n\n231#The future is now. The future is working human.|Team - this group has been the nucleus for \"what's next.\" You've ripped up and thrown away the rule book for what was. You've embraced the freedom, liberation and inspiration that comes from having a blank sheet of paper to operate from. Yes, we've been grinding the last two weeks, but we are on the precipices of exciting concepts that will propel our brand and business forward. Keep pushing, we're nearly there. With gratitude, -C\n\n232#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n233#Partner in Crime|It seems like not a day goes by where I am not reaching out to get your opinion or collaboration on something.  Jill, thank you for your partnership.  We’re making a lot of difficult decisions these days – often with more assumptions than hard data because everything is in a state of change and uncertainty.  You always have such great insights and a ways of evaluating a situation that helps us create scenario options and puts us on the best possible path forward.  You help me be better at my job – and I could not have asked for a better partner in crime.  Thank you!\n\n234#43 slacks in 19 minutes - that's some data|Yes, that's what you did together. Members of the whl-stream-tech channel - between 1:00 and 1:19 you urgently yet calmly worked together to troubleshoot, problem solve, implement, and communicate a workaround. I was watching you. You saved the day because you worked together and responded decisively. Sweat and tears, and a whole lot of teamwork.  Not to imply there were not many backup plans and scenarios discussed in advance because there was no shortage of that. But when the moment came, decisions needed to be made, action needed to be taken... and you did all that. Kudos.\n\n235#WHLive Stream Core Creative|Team, I gotta say when this project dropped on us with the deadline it had - I was shitting my pants.  But after a few days of early conversations and landing on some form of a concept - you started bringing it to life.  Early keynote graphics, scripts and show flows, injection of entertaining segment that made/didn't make the cut,  locking down speakers and schedules, communicating to the execs our executional needs, and the list goes on and on.  It started coming together piece by piece, hour after hour, and then we started figuring out how to steer the project.  I started to feel confident about it.  Live stream vendor was locked.  Content was getting locked.  Filming was locked.  At 12:30pm on 5/12 I hit the equivalent of a big red button and we were broadcasting to the world.  In less than 6 weeks you created a F^*$ing movie. And we didn't want to fight each other after!  I have never done anything this big in such a short time in my career, and I am a grizzled veteran of this world. What a team.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.  Thank you.\n\n236#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n237#All the right things in all the right places|The Workhuman Livestream is going live tomorrow!!! There have been so many moving parts, who is involved? where will it live? when will we have approval? what about follow up? is that contract signed? This group has kept up with every turn, crazy leap, and last-minute \"yes, and...\"! I cannot thank you all enough for how on top of everything you have been. I feel like the whole team was kept in step and it has been because of your constant communication, reminders, and check ins! We are in the home stretch!!! Thank you!\n\n238#Spotlight Speaker Success Stories|Team - thank you for stepping into the spotlight during our last three marketing town halls. You’ve shown at an exemplary level of innovation, determination, and grit amidst our new normal. You’ve conveyed your success stories (Merck webinar, Keeping work human series, and WHL) with an awesome combination of humility and accessibility. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being leaders of the moment and in the moment. The best practices you’ve shared and modeled to achieve such high levels of success are great guideposts and shining examples of a high performing culture ! Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n239#Wait! Was that really only 90 days?!|Team - Thank you for making this next phase of our journey and evolution together as a team so successful! Lets just say the first 60 day together were much different than our last 30 days together(ish)! Wanted to celebrate all we’ve done together in our first 3 months as a team. Attached is my quick recap and where I see us delivering results in Q2. Thank you, I’m truly appreciative of all you do!  With gratitude, -C\n\n240#Livestream Launch!|I was going to find an image of a nice stream for this recognition, but the way this team came together and launched – with immediate results (more on that below) – a rocket made more sense.  We have been in a hurry up and wait, start and stop process on bringing a digital/live stream event to market for a bit now.  In the past few weeks it all started to come together, and this past weekend it all really came together.  Our band of weekend warriors once again rallied to pull everything into place and then dragged many more souls into the battle for a rapid Monday launch.  With Dianne at the helm providing impeccable project management and, might I say, a few beatings we were all kept on task.  Jen, Chris, Kevin, and Jay – you were right there every step of the way on design iterations and animations.  Owen, you’ve been a master of the nuanced wordsmithing we’ve needed on this.  Matt, Biz, Geoff and Mark – you built, staged, tested, and launched all new site pages and elements in almost no time at all.  Your work set-up for a great launch – where we dragged in Anthony to build, test, and deploy our emails with about an hours time from asset to release.  Rob and Roshni jumped in to iterate social/digital and bring us live globally.  Colleen, Anne and Jess pulled the enablement tools and comms together and put them in everyone’s hands to help us all share and promote the program.  Mike and Lauren working the external networks to amplify and extend reach.  And Jill.  Maintaining a calm presence, helping align priorities and strategy, and ensuring we’re on track for the overall business goal.  We’re really just a the start of a 3-week journey.  Much work is yet to be done, but you put us in the best possible place to succeed.  So much so, that within hours of launching, we already over 1000 registrants.  Impressive!  I so enjoy working with this team and knowing that together – we can and will deliver!\n\n241#Questions & Answers = Crushing it|The questions were: \"Are you there?\" \"You working?\" \"Can you come inside on this beautiful Sunday?\" The answers from this group were \"Yes!\" \"How can I help?\" \"Be right there!\"  Thank your dedication, time out of your weekend (or your whole weekend), and flexibility. For answering your phone, responding to texts, jumping on calls, endless Slacks, and using Workfront ;-)  Multiple communication channels are needed to launch a promotional campaign in 4 days, over a weekend, while working remotely. I am proud of you, to be a part of this team, and for what we accomplished together. Thank you.\n\n242#You can’t get more “Live” than that!|Chris, Jeff, Jill - I’m so impressed with the leadership, speed and agility you’ve demonstrated to wrestle a plan for our first all digital WHL event to the ground. The campaign is of the moment relevant, the creative feels on brand fresh, and the determination of your efforts comes clearly through in the Day 1 results. Where others might say ten thousand what?! You’ve said - got it! ... And here’s the plan! Some folks see a countdown clock and say “yikes, pressure.” This group of event and marketing pros says, “pressure makes diamonds!” Excited to see this team shine bright like a diamond and be heads down on execution. Keep up the great work, and keep leading to show the impossible is possible! With gratitude, -C\n\n243#Best. Team. Ever.|Thank you for a great Zoom meeting to align around our short term priorities while daring to dream and proactively plan for longer term priorities. Not an easy task to do when the \"here and now\" is all anyone of us can think about lately. I was so impressed with everyone's willingness to think about team resources in a different way and also our shared commitment to the good work and strategic thinking that we already did together pre COVID-19 crisis. This was my most productive meeting of the day and an awesome way to end the week. I am grateful for this awesome team. Thank you!\n\n244#It was a moment!|A huge and sincere T H A N K Y O U to this long list of amazing humans. It seems like an eternity but just a short few weeks ago at the Executive off-site down in Florida, Eric and his team were all seated for a session. Each person was handed a sealed envelope with their name on it. Inside were the private letters each of you wrote. Some vulnerable, some filled with humor but all filled with how that person made you feel. It was a moment! Silence, smiles and even tears. It's not every day you get the chance to silence an entire Executive Team and remind them of how much they also matter and how they have influenced your day, week - or career. Thank you for being at the heart of what made this moment come to life.You all are amazing!  -Rebecca & Alice\n\n245#Top Notch Leadership|Thank you, Jill, for your leadership over the past challenging weeks.  These are unprecedented times and you continue to lead our team with a steady hand.  I appreciate your expertise, your constant communication, your collaboration and your support.   Thank you for all that you do!\n\n246#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n247#All action|I never cease to be amazed at how fast you move into solution-mode. While I  am processing the now, you are 12 steps ahead. I have never seen you get ruffled or reactionary – through any of the ups and downs we've had with this event over all the years we've worked on it! This was no exception. The way you worked to keep our event in San Antonio within hours of making the decision to cancel was amazing. You put us in a position for success. This ensures our attendees a consistent experience, honors our contractual agreements so that we won't lose the investments we have already made, you have saved all the San Antonio-specific creative that has been worked on–and can be reused– as well as made it so that we can reach out with a message that we already have next year figured out. No other conference that I've seen has been able to do this amidst all these cancellations. Your work on this has given us a huge advantage. Thank you for all that you do!!!!\n\n248#Team Corona|Coronavirus.  Covid-19.  A giant headache.  We all call it something different – especially because the situation with it has been changing minute by minute and making our decision making process so challenging.  When we made the decision to create new content and FAQ’s for our Workhuman Live site and audiences at 8PM on a Friday night, I crossed my fingers we would be able to activate.  We needed to get information out to our audiences that was clear, consistent, and valuable to ensure they felt informed and at ease.  No surprise – every single one of you stepped up.  Dianne was slacking me almost immediately with project set-up details and timelines.  Lauren had copy in my hands before 6:00 AM (you actually sent it at 1:30!?!)  Chris and Amy were both there to review, edit and get on the phone to talk it through.  Jon had site pages staged and new pop-up functionality built and staged Saturday morning.  Jen and Anthony had layouts and content ready to deploy.  Jill was providing copy strategy and reviews.  Holly and Anne were standing by ready to act as needed for our audiences.  And Lauren – our guiding light and champion of strategy supporting the whole process was as responsive as ever with reviews and feedback.  This is such an evolving and fluid situation, but the team never ceases to amaze me.  You gave up family and weekend time to help ensure our customers had the information they needed, when they needed it.  Your continued dedication and respect for customers, urgency, quality, and teamwork is amazing.  Thank you – and Cheers to Team Corona.\n\n249#Parental Unit|Jill and Jeff, Over the past week I've come to think of you as the parents of Workhuman Live. Parenting an event is rewarding and hard. The event changes and goes through phases. Sometimes the event keeps you up at night. Some days you don't see eye-to-eye on the best approach to raising an event but you respectfully work together to figure it out. You each bring unique and valid perspectives to the role. Sometimes it is hard to watch your event go through a rough patch but you believe the event will make it and grow from the experience. Thank you for being the parents of Workhuman Live. The event is in good hands because of your dedication and exhausting efforts. Be proud of the movement you are raising!\n\n250#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n251#Determination + Grit = Growth|Team - I was very excited to see the latest projections for WHL double down on Sunday. This is hard and important work you are doing to drive human moments that matter globally complicated by worldwide challenges above/beyond our control. Your consistency, determination, and unrelenting drive to succeed are paying off based on the +14% YOY increase vs. same time LY with a projected 3,721 registrants. Keep pushing. And in words of Bruce Springsteen, “Getting an audience is hard. Sustaining an audience is hard. It demands a consistency of thought, of purpose and of action over a long period of time.”  With gratitude, -C\n\n252#Booksellermania|Jill -  You can't turn a corner right now without someone asking about the WHL staff list.  Thank you for initiating time to meet with me yesterday. As I unravel and learn all the bookstore parts, I appreciate having the staff list in my brain so I can schedule the humans to provide a pleasant experience for our attendees. Moving forward every day - Cheers!\n\n253#Testing 1, 2, 1, 2|Thank you for giving part of your Saturday to come into the office to test Workhuman Live session selection. We needed to test at a time when minimal people would be on the site and you were willing and able to help. Because of your participation we are able to provide a quality session selection experience for our attendees. I appreciate your commitment and time. Cheers!\n\n254#Site Visit Specialists|Team, just wanted to take a moment to recognize all that goes into planning every aspect of an event like WH Live, the site visits are no exception.... multiple threads, tasks, logistics, decisions and lots and lots of walking.  You are all my heroes and I thank you (on behalf of all the folks that will receive the benefit of enjoying the beautiful result)!  Well done!\n\n255#Great Marketing Team Meet and Greet!|Jill, Z -   Thank you for stepping up to coordinate a well-executed team meet and greet yesterday. This was an important forum to create and hold quickly to help define whole team success! Through the Q&A session and ice breaker of \"what would your walk up song be in the soundtrack of your life be\" (excited for that playlist to be released! :) you helped me and the broader team understand more about each other's unique background and personal style. It also helped identify that across the team we have over 75 years of marketing experience - impressive! Feedback has been super positive - that it helped bring us all together quickly, that it is clear there is respect for what the team does, and that it helped provide important transparency to my excitement and desire to advocate for the team, ideas, and progress.   With gratitude, -C\n\n256#Hackathon for the Ages!|Amazing team, I cannot thank each and every one of you enough for your brilliance during the second Workhuman Live Hackathon this week! First and foremost, with Ignite around the corner;  there is no shortage things to get accomplished, GREATLY appreciate the time taken out of your busy days to help us crowdsource ideas and think differently to capture the excitement AND carry it forward, even when WH Live 2020 comes to an end. Nice work being respectful brainstormers and challenging one another. I am so excited to put these ideas in action against our personas and a timeline. We have never been in better shape to make the most of Workhuman Live and it's because of this group, Cheers to you all!\n\n257#Hackathon Preparation Brilliance!|I wanted to thank you so much for your help with the Workhuman Live Hackathon this week.  Stacey, Cara, Tamra, and Jill: Awesome work ensuring the team was well hydrated and full of snacks to draw out all of the brilliance of the group in the room! Holly, Mark and Anne, appreciate your willingness to lend a hand bringing supplies over to 100, arriving early to help setup and staying late to help clean up. And last but, not least, a HUGE call out to Jeff, for the endless hours of prep work that went into ensuring the afternoon had a great flow and would be productive for all of those involved, really amazing work team!\n\n258#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n259#WH Live  - we hit our first milestone!!!!|Team,  I am so proud of, energized and inspired by each of you!  We have hit our first milestone!  Your creativity, dedication and action bias have been evident from day 1!   I truly look forward to taking this exceptional movement forward with this tremendously talented team. On behalf of everyone that will be lucky enough to enjoy WH Live, Thank You!\n\n260#Traveling Humans|Jill - Thank you for planning the San Antonio site visit. But this is more of a thank you for your attention to the humans. You are always aware and mindful of where we can be included to use our skills, as well as how we are treated. You have a subtle yet purposeful way of managing the group to maximize the resources you bring on the road, adjusting the plan as needed without missing a beat, and including each person in just the right places. It is a huge skillset and asset to the company. Cheers!\n\n261#Workhuman live 2020 usability hub vision|This is a well over due one! I want to thank you both for all your input into my initial proposal for the usability lab at Workhuman live 2020! From my initials pitch you both were very welcoming and open to the idea and straight away provided feedback and direction to myslef and the team for how to progress forward with the idea. As we kept meeting more and more ideas came up all I favour of enhancing the experience of the attendees at Workhuman as well as helping the products teams to learn about our users! After every session with you i feel so inspired by your positive attitude and creativity! I’m so excited to see how this is going to come to life and looking forward to collaborate more! Thak you\n\n262#Amazing WHLive Update!!!|Team, I was so proud and happy that today we got the opportunity to showcase the tremendous work, planning and thoughtfulness that has been happening behind the scenes on WHLive.  Each of you brought your ‘A’ game and collectively we were able to demonstrate the commitment to bringing this movement forward and harnessing its’ strength for the company!  I am so inspired by each of you every day!  Thank you!!!\n\n263#Champion of change!|Jill, thank you so much for being our FIRST manager to post a new employee announcement using the new process of sharing on Gratitudes and linking the team over to it via the Slack channel. Thanks for being a champion of change and setting a great example from day 2 of the new way of doing things!\n\n264#Workhuman Sponsor Support|Jill and Lauren, I came to you with a suggestion for a Workhuman sponsor opportunity with Bright Horizons and you jumped right in.   We had one of their B2B leads in the office today and you got her thinking and exciting about a potential partnership even though we didn't have a formal proposal to present. We have a ways to go, but I appreciate you both being open to new and innovate ways they can bring their brand to WHL2020 and beyond...\n\n265#Adjustments on the fly|Team, It was only four business days ago that we sat down and talked about our experiences from the first few executive forums and re-envisioned what it could be. In the ensuing days, I know that you all worked tirelessly to create the new experience that we had in mind. Today’s session was amazing and light years ahead of where we were this time last week. It’s because you had the courage and energy to take those ideas and make them real earlier this week. Thank you, and well done!\n\n266#HIRED!|Jill - congratulations on your newest hire!  I am so excited for Cara to come on board.  I have had so much fun partnering with you on this search!  Throughout the search you were responsive and honest.  Thank you for always quickly getting back to me, and quickly delivering feedback on candidates.  Also, thank you for teaching me about the world of events!  I have never recruited for this space, and your guidance was so helpful.  It was so fun to learn more about your function!  You created great candidate experiences for each candidate we interviewed.  Thank you for being a fantastic recruiting partner!\n\n267#Citrix Onsite Experience Excellence|Jill - thanks for being amazing partner for the Citrix onsite. From securing catering, purchasing essentials to uplevel the experience (dishes, silverware, glasses snack baskets, macaroons....and of course, champagne) to being available and on call throughout the day to support the needs of the meeting and attendees. We'll continue to learn from each of these experience to build the best Workhuman Innovation Center experience and I'm glad to be doing it with you!\n\n268#Making a list and checking it twice|I loved collaborating with you both on the wish list of must-haves vs nice-to-haves in prep for today's EBC meeting. We synthesized the ideas into a cohesive format and you were able to walk the team through a discussion that was thoughtful and productive. We even ended the meeting a few minutes early! Well done!!\n\n269#B is for Bizzabo|When you are working with a new vendor using new software, and the main contact with that vendor is no longer involved... you need a Plan B. Thank you all for being part of Plan B for Bizzabo. You were ready, willing, able, nimble, and responsive in getting up to speed with the platform. You set up the program, tested it, connected it, troubleshooted, learned the ins and outs, developed copy and creative, and collectively tackled the Bizzabo beast!   Thank you for all of your time and attention in a very important step on the trail to San Antonio. The Workhuman Live 2020 reg site is open for bizzness because of your efforts - cheers!\n\n270#Bottling the Experience!|As a parent, I have heard (and used) the phrase “It takes a village.”  I believe that same idea applies to many of the business challenges we encounter.  Being asked to develop a marketing approach to Bottle Workhuman Live – I knew right away it would take a village.  And WOW – did you all step up.  Taking three hours out of your afternoon to participate in our first ever ‘Bottle Workhuman Live Hack-a-Thon’ was a big ask in the midst of so many competing priorities.  Yet, every one of you jumped at the change.  You even took the time to do some homework in advance and help formulate the direction of the workshop.  You changed schedules to be there.  You came focused and ready.  You gave it your all!  I now have a 20 page deck of ideas to leverage – to create some fun, exciting, bold and disruptive marketing from.  All thanks to you.  I have a deep appreciation for every one of you.  Thank you!\n\n271#'The Art of Gathering' Live Experience & Workshop|Kevin, Jeff, and Jill, thanks for your openness to a content related idea I had for the Monday of Workhuman Live. I’ve been following an up-and-coming speaker for the last few months and after I had a preliminary call with her team, I just knew she’d be the right fit for our audience. It’s an interactive workshop, which of course requires a team effort to execute. Jill, you jumped on board right away with a few suggestions on where and how to implement it. Jeff, you asked all the right questions from a promotional standpoint to make sure we convey the value effectively to potential attendees. Kevin, per usual you give me the opportunity to explore any speaker, topic, or session format that could bring value to the conference. We’re in the final stages of getting this wrapped up and I’m excited to put it into motion.\n\n272#Understanding!|Jill, sorry for staying longer than I booked in the Dublin conference room. You had scheduled an important meeting, and my sales call ran over my scheduled time. You said \"don't worry, we will find somewhere else\". Thank you so much for understanding!\n\n273#Wh Live Agenda Building|Many thanks to this group for your time brainstorming the Workhuman Live agenda layout. Now is the time for us to look at different options and ask all of the questions. “How many sessions is the right amount?” “Where can there be more facilitated networking?” And most importantly, “What can we do next year that’s new and different?” Next step, our site visit in two weeks to test some layouts and floor plans!\n\n274#What a Brainstorm|There’s nothing like a three-hour meeting, sandwiched between the company meeting, a marketing vp meeting, and countless other commitments.  Yet, every one of you came with your A-Game – ready to brainstorm a whole new approach to the Workhuman Live website experience.  Thank you all for showing up focused, open-minded, and collectively in alignment on exceeding our audiences’ expectations through the site.  Reimagining a website is never easy, especially when trying to set aside what we already know to try new things.  Every one of you stepped up to share your areas of expertise and add value into the overall plan.  Your input was so valuable and is helping to frame out an exceptional site plan for 2020.\n\n275#Schneider|Jill - your willingness to step in and help manage and organize the catering for Schneider, from breakfast to lunch to champagne toast (including yummy cookie platters) to snack baskets that you put together yourself on a weekend, added to the human experience that the Schneider attendees noticed loud and clear. You played an integral role in getting the \"appreciation station\" revised and up and running, as well as supporting the team throughout the day with any details or logistics, which is a true testament to what a team player you are - willing to take on any task in order to ensure an events success. I not only appreciate your support in this event, I learned a lot of invaluable lessons from you and for that I am VERY thankful!\n\n276#Mind Blowing Experience for 39 Global SE Execs|\"A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions\" that's what our goal was from the beginning of this journey and I'm thrilled to be able to say BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO to you all for absolutely crushing it!! At the end of their full day Learning Expedition, I had asked them to think back on the day and share an inspiring moment(s) that resonated deeply with them and think about what they can take back and action in their organizations. With regards to the experience, here is what they had to say \"One of the things that we can learn from this Learning expedition is that we should invest more in the human experience and how impactful that is. What a fantastic day this has been from the very beginning even before we arrived. From the hotel room drops, to the hand written notes, to the welcome party, the thoughtful gifts of resources and the charger in the reusable tote bags and charges as well as the personal videos that brought the voice of our employees to us... such incredible attention to detail... We need to do a much better job at thinking about this and putting the human equation into the experience\". All the hard work and coordination and putting humans in the forefront has made such an impression and has inspired 39 SE Executives and their CHRO to aspire to emulate what we do! The infinite ways in which we thought about the details has brought about admiration in a way we never thought we would actually heard vocalized so explicitly and sincerely! They didn't just say this once either! So many thank yous with similar elaborate specifics were shared by the likes of the CHRO of NAM, VP of HR, SVP of Talent, SVP of Global Rewards and their Global CHRO! To think that this was our very first one and with 39 Executives from all across the globe too!! Cheers to you team and I cannot wait to see how much more we will learn and grow from this fantastic kick off!\n\n277#WH News: Our events team|Jill- wanted to thank you for taking the time to share the many little things that both you and the events team work on day in and day out to make Workhuman Live happen! You took the time to answer some very specific questions, and shared back content so quickly. Thank you for your contributions to this month's WH News, and for being such a great teammate!\n\n278#Moving Mountains|Not only do we have a new place to go for Workhuman Live, but we have a FABULOUS new place to go, that allows us to make the changes we'd like to see at the time of year we'd like to see them.  I am grateful for your thoughtful approach to the folks in Denver, and your tenacity with the San Antonio group - which has delivered an exceptional offer from them to us for 2020.  Thank you for the search, the incredibly quick turnaround of information and the delicacy which which you have negotiated the near impossible.  I can't wait to see what comes next!\n\n279#SO. MUCH. FUN!|You were all rockstars in our brainstorming meeting for the Executive Briefing Center. You did your homework and came prepared, we were energized, laughed a lot, and came up with some amazing ideas that we shared! I loved how quickly we all bonded together as a tiger team, it made me smile watching all the connections, how one idea fed another, they all wove like a dance. Where did the time go? This is a huge initiative for our company and I couldn't be more grateful for the team I get the pleasure of working with.\n\n280#Minimally Viable Presentation|MVP TEAM! WOW! What an amazing feat pulling together one of the best narratives we ever had presented at the ELT meeting today! The information flowed, they were wowed, they laughed, it showed our strengths and highlighted our successes. You ALL were integral to making this come to life, especially during the last minute crunch hours (YAY BRUINS!!!) I was so honored to re-pre-sent all that Marketing has been working on what's to come. You are a fantastic group of humans, so grateful to work with you.\n\n281#J&J|While most people will see J&J and think \"Johnson&Johnson\" (even myself in customer experience), I now think of it as Jill&Jen! You two have been incredible leading up to and during Workhuman Live. I appreciate you giving me access to be part of the \"core team\" and be involved in so many things that are new to my role and give me a better understanding of the inner workings of the event. Jill - you never miss a thing. Not one! Always on top of every single detail and that is SO appreciated. You are a master! Jen - your creativity inspired me to thing bigger and better every time. You helped me create a vision for items in the lounge that were an absolute HIT! Thank you for sharing your beautiful brain! HUGE thank you to the both of you for all you do day in and day out to make Workhuman Live incredible and inspiring.\n\n282#The Best Workhuman Ever!|Jen, Ellen & Jill, congratulations on delivering an absolutely incredible experience for our customers and future customers. We had our fair share of challenges, but each one was overcome with aplomb and grace while you remained focused on delivering something exceptional. Workhuman continues to be the best conference I have ever personally attended, and judging from the reaction of our attendees - they agree wholeheartedly! Well done!\n\n283#May I Chime In|Thank you so much for your team work and being a room host at our Executive Forum dinner at Husk. From setting up name badges, welcoming guests, ringing those chimes to move guests along, keeping track of time, clearing tables (Ellen), and making sure guests left with everything they came with - your efforts to make this event a success were truly remarkable! Thank you for being part of this team and this event!\n\n284#Juggling it all to deliver success!|Thank you for literally dedicating every waking hour to ensure Workhuman 2019 was a success! Many people may not have seen the incredible amount of dedication, determination, resilience, innovation and imagination that you put into this event.  They may not be aware that you had a hand in almost every single detail and may not have seen the blood, sweat and tears that went into the planning and on-site execution.  They may not appreciate the re-engineering of vast areas of the event that occurred in the final hours to reduce costs.  I saw much of it and I hope you know I appreciate all that you have done.  From the customer events perspective I could not be happier.  The Wildhorse was a resounding success. Thank you for working with me on the details to ensure it was a perfect realization of the experience we envisioned.  Customer connect was a huge success and we will blow it out for next year.  The customer demos were awesome.  Cocktails and connections was a wonderful evening of bonding and connection, Innovations and Libations was a success and the last-minute band addition and menu changes were well received!  The customer lounge was a huge hit and you even managed to move my team over to the Gaylord on day 2 so they could be close to the customers they were responsible more readily.  It is very easy to let the opportunities for improvement take the forefront when we reflect on the success of events, but I hope that you can look at what you have achieved and pause for a minute appreciating the vast success that was Workhuman 2019.  Yes, there were a few hiccups and there are always going to be things we learn from and can do better next time but Workhuman 2019 was the best yet and you should be incredibly proud of your massive contribution to the success!  Well done Jill.  I am very excited to start planning 2020 !  You are a joy to work with and thank you for dedicating so much energy to the customer experience and to supporting my team!  WE appreciate you!\n\n285#My partner in crime|It feels so crazy to be on the other side of the enormous undertaking that is Workhuman (Live!). I can't imagine having done this with anyone else – if I was the imagination, you were the determination. Every time I have a wild and crazy idea, you were the one figuring out how we can actually make it happen–from humans on boats to executing the perfect CXO dinner. You are the one crunching the budget numbers, crossing them with what systems can do which things, you are the one jumping through hoops of fire to guard the integrity of the vision-but also helping me craft that vision. As strategic as you are logistic -you leave me in awe of how you think of every last detail. The amount of seats, the waffle wednesday, the perfect bite size of a piece of hot chicken. Every. Last. Little. Thing. I love making this event with you – I am beyond excited to wipe the slate clean and start thinking about Denver. Knowing you're in it with me makes all the difference.\n\n286#Exec Forum Dinner Excellence!|Team, you did a stellar job last night taking our most important group through an amazing and unique experience that they will never forget. The food and drink were top-notch, the venue gorgeous, the event beautifully choreographed, and the networking incredibly successful - as demonstrated by the warm conversation in the exec forum lounge all day today. I know it was a high-stakes, high-pressure event, and you pulled it off wonderfully. Everyone I spoke to absolutely raved about what a great time they had. Well done!\n\n287#Amazing Partner!|Jill, well done for all the amazing work you have done this year for Workhuman Live in Nashville!  I know that this has been a crazy year and we have had more bumps in the road than normal, but you have handled each with grace and professionalism.  On a customer front I want to thank you for being an incredible partner and support throughout the process!  Whatever the time of day or night when I have reached out to you, I have been stunned by the speed of your turnaround!  You have been so helpful throughout every single change/addition/modification and challenge!  You have helped me realize my vision of bringing the Workhuman cloud to life at The Wildhorse and I am SO excited that we are in the final stretch now.  Thank you for being an amazing partner.  I love how well we work together and thank you for understanding when I have pushed for certain things to be done a certain way.  I love and respect your opinion and feedback and appreciate how we can find the win win compromise each time that is required!  Thank you, Jill, – I hope you can take a moment and breathe.  Look around you and be proud of what you have achieved!  Enjoy every moment of Workhuman Live!  I can’t wait to see you tonight in Nashville!\n\n288#Sharing all the Workhuman things!|I wanted to take a moment, before we head to Nashville to recognize each of you for all your help making sure we shared information with employees so they know what's going on in terms of their travel to and in Nashville, their roles on site, the guidelines around meals, etc. If I actually had an excel with every little detail it would be thousands of rows worth. I cannot count how many questions I've asked each of you, and you always respond quickly and with the info I need. In particular, our biggest work was the training for all staff going to TN - a wee 70-something slide deck. The team did a great job delivering, answering questions, and just being prepared in general. You've been great partners to the internal comms team and I am excited to see all of your work come to life next week. Thank you!\n\n289#Vitamin C|Is the juice worth the squeeze. You bet! This recognition is for getting every ounce of juice for Nashville. Working tirelessly to get every last message to every potential attendee - local, agenda, celebrities - you targeted all the profiles. Sharpening and re-sharpening the budget pencil to make sure every dollar spent is impactful. 110% mindful of the attendee experience. Not giving up on a reg system that is maybe not perfect to make sure it will be just right for all our needs - bootstrapping is real. Here's a final boost of vitamin C - cheers to you!\n\n290#Adapting to Change|I am grateful to have you at the helm of this enormous budget.  We have had to make some difficult decisions and you have maintained our goals and zealously protected the true intent behind the activity.  You treat this program with the respect it warrants, and yet have found ways to manage the expenses.  Well done!\n\n291#Final Stages|Ladies, I have been extremely lucky enough to be called a part of this \"core\" team building out Workhuman Live 2019! You both need to take a moment and so extremely proud of your accomplishments leading up to right now. Jen, your vision, strength, experience, and leadership skills have exploded through everything you touch! You make everything you do looks so smooth and elite! Workhuman is blessed to have your eyes as the vision of this company. I hope you walk into Workhuman Live with a smile on your face because you deserve it all with all efforts and determination you bring everyday to work! Jill, leading lady of all things Workhuman Live! You pulled this rookie onto this team and have made me a better person because of the things I learn from you everyday. You show so much perception, well organized, driven, and are a true asset to this Workhuman Team. Your leadership shines throughout every aspect of each piece of this conference. You both work so well together as teammates because you trust each other and all your decisions are a group effort. I look forward to see this amazing conference shine more than any other year and you both should be extremely proud. Cheers ladies!\n\n292#The North Star|Jill, every year without a doubt you serve as my north star. I don't know how one person can have the brain capacity to hold so much detail but somehow you do. I can only speak for the customer side and from an outsiders perspective, it seems quite simple: 2 events, a few ambassadors, some demos, a lounge... we are good, no? HA! I know I can speak for Alice and Amanda when I say, we could not do this without you. Every year, you keep us on our toes - in line and with nothing forgotten. You help us deliver the extras, give us resources to make it happen and you never miss a beat. Here we are in year five and we are in the eye of the hurricane. I wanted you to know that you are killing it.  There is nothing we can't do as long as we can see our north star. Thank you.\n\n293#Working on a Holiday|Ladies!!!! Thank you so much for stepping in and helping us get everything out the door for the polos and the t-shirts for WorkHuman!!! We had a tight deadline and I needed answered and approvals for everything on one of the only holidays we get!!! You worked together and got everything approved and out the door yesterday! I can’t thank you enough!!!\n\n"
"294#Long weekend|= extra time to work on the event called Workhuman! Thank you for answering texts, Slacks and emails, and putting in hours over the long weekend to keep the work on track. Necessary and appreciated!\n\n295#WorkHuman Mastermind|Jill,  I need to thank you for constantly going above and beyond to create an amazing experience for all attendees at WorkHuman. I'm privileged to work closely with you on many items behind the scenes regarding this event. It is amazing to watch you navigate thousands of different details that feed into the experience that is WorkHuman. What is even more masterful is watching you keep an eye to the strategy behind the event constantly. Add extra session, accommodate a new product element, adjust a budget down significantly, know the difference between different dulcimer instruments....the list of details you manage for the team is unbelievable. What I'm most impressed with though is your calm and steady approach to everything. We are so lucky to have you as part of the team. Thank you for all you do! Anne Marie\n\n296#Perfection at WorkHuman|Thank you for taking care of the smallest of details as we build out the WH agenda and programming of networking activity. You have assumed the important role of managing the many stakeholders requirements and requests while ALWAYS keeping the needs of the attendees top of mind.  This dance of priorities is a difficult one and you have managed to meet everyone's needs without sacrificing the experience that our customers and prospects have come to expect.  Well done!\n\n297#Working Human, Working Smart = Big Results!|Hey team, I wanted to acknowledge the great progress you have all made in just a few short weeks. From getting more data to better understanding registration sources and drivers, to launching an incredibly successful Cyber Monday campaign, it feels like every week the team gets savvier, more disciplined and more effective. You are a living demonstration of the power of \"working smart\" vs. just \"working hard\". I can't wait to see even more insights and intelligence as we continue to learn and optimize!\n\n298#WorkHuman 2019 Prep|Ladies, I want to take the time to thank you for the last couple months of getting me on board to this years WorkHuman! I am super excited to step this into full gear and take the next steps on the planning of such a great event! It’s been a pleasure working with both of you and I thank you for taking me on this journey I have already learned so much from both of you along with so many laughs already! I feel as though I will gain a lot of knowledge on conference planning from you two! I look forward to the next 4 and half months of planning!!!\n\n299#A strong foundation|On my commute I have been listening to an audiobook that talks about the building of the Cathedral. At one point there's an explanation about how the roof of the cathedral can sustain all the rain and snow that falls from above, because of the depth and strength of the foundation below.  So often lately, it's been snowing and pouring down. You never fail to find some way to support me. You take the weight of a million little things off my shoulders. You pick up the load and remind me that the deluge won't last forever.  Thank you for being such an amazing foundation.\n\n300#The masterminds!|The two masterminds are at it again! I just wanted to shout from the rooftops a big THANK YOU for every detail you planned and coordinated with Sparks, with the Gaylord, WildHorse Saloon, car services, and our internal folks to make our site visit in Nashville a big success. When these trips breeze by with laughter and fun, achieving goals we set, sometimes it makes it seem like putting them together was an easy thing to do. I know that's not always the case and things are changing up until the last minute. You both make it seem like a breeze because you are skilled veterans! I know I walked away feeling great about our plans for March and having clarity about what we can achieve with the space and vendors. The tasting at the WildHorse was fantastic and I loved your idea of pulling in the moonshine. You guys have event driven brains with creative hearts. Thank you for handling everything and helping us be more successful in each of our own areas. We couldn't do it without you.\n\n301#WorkHuman 2019 success!|Jen, Jill, thank you very much for reaching out and taking the initiative to gather input from the sales leadership team regarding specific ways we can drive WH'19 pipeline results. Among many goals, two are certainly to move more prospects into the pipeline and progress more opportunities into the \"closed won\" column. The exercise brought some interesting ideas and strategies to enhance the likelihood of success. It was a great example of teamwork, collaboration and focus. We are more than happy to help with the execution of these ideas. Thanks again!\n\n302#At long last...|I have joked about the fact that since WorkHuman '18 ended, I don't have many reasons to work directly with you until the next WorkHuman, and that makes me sad. Well, sad no more! WorkHuman is ramp ramp ramping up and I finally get to see more of your shining face! You have already been so helpful and thoughtful with shooting video on the upcoming September site visit I just can't share enough to the rest of our company how kick ass you are. I'm so glad you're part of our team and I can't wait keep on creating the monster that is WorkHuman with you! Thank you for your efforts.\n\n303#Thanks, partner!|Jill - just a quick thank you to you for reaching out regarding an upcoming initiative you are going to offer to all. I can't tell you how much I appreciate you giving me a heads up, asking for my input, and doing so more than a month before the activity will take place. Thank you for being such a great partner to internal comms always!\n\n304#Thank you for recommending our newest Globostar!|Jill, thank you so much for having the trust in our team and respect for our organization to personally recommend someone from your network for the VP, Global Events position. It says a huge amount about how you feel about this place, and we're so thrilled to be able to bring on board top talent like Ellen. Thank you again; that referral bonus will be very well-deserved!\n\n305#It's all happening!|Jill, it's early months still in WorkHuman 2019 planning but what a pleasure it is to work with you knowing you are 2 steps ahead in scoping out the cadence and interdependencies involved in a very complex project. I appreciate the initiative you've taken across so many elements -- housing (saving money!), transportation/airfare (saving more money!) registration software (to improve attendee experience and help us optimize by segment), evening event planning (giving us more options) and being smart about how we use agency time and talent. Great work, look forward to what's next!\n\n306#Workhuman Wonder woman|Jill, I need to take a minute to recognize what a rockstar you are. We all get to Workhuman and recognize what an amazing event it is. What they may not realize is you being the huge task of getting us ready more than a year in advance. You're running a million different floor plan versions, agenda version, budget plans, housing options for everyone. You're making presentation plan after presentation to help everyone see the big picture vision. This is an event that touches our entire company but no one more than you. Your love of this event shines through when I get to see how much care and nurturing you put in daily to make it the massive success it's become. Keep up the great work! I appreciate all that you done and continue to do! Anne Marie\n\n307#We will find a way - we always do|It takes a village, yes it does. It has also taken two extremely determined, dedicated, passionate individuals to keep the cart on it's tracks to the finish line! The two of you are a powerhouse. So much of what we accomplished this year would not be possible without you. When I was working with you on Customer Experience, I felt like that was your #1 priority but somehow you managed to offer this level of support/guidance to other departments as well as build on relationships with external parties at the same time. How was it all possible?! Great relationships make a huge difference in business and this rang true when we were on-site in Austin and Ash and his Marriott Team were willing to do anything for us (fully comp'ing the cabanas, saving the best rooms for our rain back up, etc.). We have received rave reviews on all customer events ranging from the drinks to the atmosphere. I received so many thank you's and compliments from customers and it reminded me of Ash when he shared the coins and how important it is to thank those in the \"back of the house.\" It's not just the customers though who do not know all the faces of WH, there are so many team members who aren't fully aware of the herculean effort put forth by the two of you. I don't have a coin but if you can believe it, I found these two pins LOL. I'll shine them up and get them over to you. I can't thank you enough for the tremendous effort and care you put in to every engagement, detail, task, request, deadline, relationship, reservation, experience, the list goes on.....! I know that working with you we will always find a way for everything - we always do!\n\n308#Music to My Ears: When Is Our Next Budget Meeting?|Jill, I want to recognize you for your ongoing WH Logistics budgeting efforts. You have not stopped since returning from Austin. On the one hand, I listen to you move forward in planning WorkHuman Logistics 2019. Yet, WorkHuman Logistics 2018 budgeting is still top of mind. Working through this budget line by line helps to ensure its accuracy and the areas that we need to zoom in on. I appreciate these steps and know that each meeting and update gets us closer to accomplishing our goal, to close the budget on track and in a timely manner.\n\n309#Great Fireflies|As I recover from and reflect upon WorkHuman 2018, I am grateful for our partnership with Sparks. This year was bigger and better than ever, which meant more things to create, produce, worry about. While it was physically more demanding (oiy, the bookstore and concrete floors!) it was also less stressful than previous years in the weeks leading up to Austin. That is because we have a super relationship with Sparks. The many weekly meetings and open lines of communication built a foundation for creativity to shine and it assets were managed down to the last approval. I want to recognize you for building this trusted partnership with a solid vendor that can support us in propelling WorkHuman into the future. Cheers!\n\n310#WorkHuman|WorkHuman was not AN event. It was THE event. But, amazing as it was, this award is for the path that got us there. I want to work on events with you forever. I learned SO much from you over the course of this journey–when to freak out, when NOT to freak out, how to think about the timeline and how creative fits into this whole churning machine that is a giant conference. You helped me figure out where to aim my ideas and my concerns, taught me how to manage and direct this amazing outside vendor and I feel like I have such a better handle on how this whole thing works! Building this with you was fun-and full of shisito peppers-and in my career so far this may be the thing I am the most proud of! I cannot WAIT to start digging into Nashville! Thank you for EVERYTHING!!!\n\n311#At the center of a great experience!|Jill, what a WorkHuman! I want to thank you for your leadership across the board and call out the huge contribution you made to its great success. Your expertise and judgment helped as every step of the way and you served as a great partner to many across the team- inside marketing, creative, sales, customer success and of course, finance! There are so many highlights for a project that started before WH 2017 ended: the RFP process that led to the selection of a strong and capable agency partner, many behind-the-scenes coaching sessions to ensure their success, a methodical approach to breaking down and planning different experiences and ensuring every key voice felt heard, and, importantly, managing critical relationships across the Austin Convention Center and hotel partners. You also were on top of every penny of the budget and promptly went into problem solving mode when faced with challenges-- for example, when we realized there was a very real chance the Fairmont might not open, you had a plan B in place immediately to compensate for the loss of 800 hotel rooms and the venue for multiple evening events! That was not easy! And, during the event, you were trouble shooting every day so we could deliver the best possible experience.Thank you for all of that and more!\n\n312#A true partner!!!|Jill, thank you so very much for being an amazing partner to deliver a great customer experience from the moment we first started talking about the customer experience in 2017 through to the execution on site this week.  You have been flexible when needed, clear on the processes required to keep everything on track and deliver success, clear about the deadlines  that could be extended and when they needed to be adhered to so as not to risk any issues.  You always make it clear what the risks are so that we can decide to take calculated risks when needed.  Your insight and support across our three key events plus the customer lounge along with your expert management of Sparks has been critical to our success.  You are so easy to work with and thank you for helping with so many customer on-site questions and requests.  I love working with you on the customer experience- thank you!  I am looking forward to starting the 2019 planning!  Thank you!\n\n313#Managing WorkHuman 2018!|With WorkHuman 2018 about to begin, I wanted to recognize your amazing work over the past few weeks - and months!  Managing an event - especially one like ours - is far from easy.  Tons of details, tons of players, tons to do!  You are always so on top of it all.  Thank you for all of your strong work in getting the team ready - and working with our outside agency to produce what is sure to be another amazing WorkHuman!\n\n314#Getting everyone the info they need!|Thank you all for your help putting together the WorkHuman staff training material, and for delivering the sessions. It's great when there are many people on a team all contributing to the project - it makes a big lift like this, easy! I really appreciate your attention to the details and for helping make sure employees have all they need to know before traveling to Austin. Thank you!\n\n315#New hire for WH? A week in advance? No problem!|Jill - thank you so much for jumping in and making sure our new hire (who starts at WorkHuman!) was all set with registration and hotel rooms - and so quickly! Not only were you all can-do attitude about it, but you handled everything so efficiently and quickly. I so appreciate it as it's a CRAZY time and you didn't even blink an eye when I asked for help. Thank you so much!\n\n316#A whisper of thanks|Sometimes you see a creative effort that just blows you away-- and I saw that last week with an experience for our WorkHuman audience that is just so good, resonates on so many levels and will absolutely set the stage for an amazing event. Wow! Can't share the details just yet, but I know the coaching, feedback and advice that made this come to life in a perfect kind of way. Thank you for that, so lucky to work with you all!\n\n317#Guiding lights|Jill & Shannon -- I was VERY out of my element in my first time working through a contract negotiation AND my first time working with the GF legal team. You were both so responsive and supportive in coaching me through the whole process. I trust your guidance and don't know if we would have had a successful result without your help. Thank you!\n\n318#The Matt whisperer|Hi Jill,  I want to publicly thank you for your help and patience in coaching me on conversations with outside vendors. Few times have I been on the client end of work like this and workflow has been difficult for me, but with you patience and articulate advice, I feel like I have I have a broader view of how to express myself, ask questions, and work efficiently. Hopefully I haven't expired your patience, because I will most likely keep learning from you for a long time. Thank you!\n\n319#WorkHuman budget queen|Jill - thank you for your endless patience with my almost daily \"Whose paying for that?\" question. Sometimes phrased 'Whose budget is that coming from?\", you always have the answer I need. With so many details in your brain about WorkHuman, I appreciate the part that you share with me to wrap up so many small deliverables. Cheers!\n\n320#Keeping the WorkHuman Boat Afloat|Jill, thank you for your management of all the tiny details of WorkHuman now that we’re in the home stretch. From being the lead contact for Sparks or organizing a staff Easter lunch you’re involved in every piece of the conference, which I can imagine is overwhelming. You always have great pose, thanks for your leadership.\n\n321#You are simply amazing!|Jill and Shannon,  Not a day goes by without me asking you a ton of questions--hotel details,  registration codes, breakfasts, lunches, special considerations for attendees and speakers to name a few. You always have an answer and you always put aside whatever you are doing to help. I don't know how you keep track of everything but so grateful that you do. Thank you.\n\n322#Surprised and delighted - again and again...|Jill, I just wanted to call out your incredible commitment, determination, imagination and proactivity ongoing throughout the planning and execution phases of WorkHuman!  Since we started on this journey for WorkHuman 2018 there have been twists and turns, bumps in the road (will the Fairmont actually be open to name just one) and you have risen to the challenge time and time again!  You have achieved the seemingly impossible – after our onsite when we were concerned about the Fairmont opening you managed to secure a whole new venue at the JW for all the exclusive customer activities – negotiated amazing deals and secured exclusive rights to the incredible pool deck space for our welcome reception which was previously thought impossible!   Thank you for always thinking about what the customers will need throughout the process!!!  You have even proactively juggled budgets and secured production resource to be sure that the Shark Tank experience will be second to none!  Jill – you are a great partner and you consistently surprise and delight me!  I love working with you and so appreciate your unwavering commitment to achieving excellence!  Thank you for giving us the comfort that we have you to count on, time and time again!  You are appreciated!!!!  This will be a magnificent success – so excited to see all the planning come together in just a few short weeks!!!!  Thank you!\n\n323#A Win and an In for LinkedIn at WH|Amanda, Jill, and Jen -  I wanted to both congratulate and thank you for the tremendous work you all did on the LinkedIn sponsorship for WorkHuman.  In a very short amount of time, you crafted and build a phenomenal package and activation that not only met LinkedIn’s goals – but also our own.  You were agile, quick thinking, and also thought big.  The end result will be a perfect, complementary component of WorkHuman Central that gives attendees something to interact with (learning and having fun at the same time).  It brings the entire community closer.  To top it off, this will enhance our relationship with LinkedIn, who is already a great customer partner.  Well done!\n\n324#WorkHuman Budget Tracking at its Best!|Jill, I want to commend you for the awesome job that you are doing with the WorkHuman budgeting and logistics. I can truly see firsthand the thought, work, and orchestration that you are doing to improve this area. The budget is evolving as priorities and responsibilities change. You have shared your method of tracking, included me in sessions to catch up, and together we collaborated on how we can update these changes so that we have a trail and visibility for what needs updating. In addition, you have put forth great effort to strengthen the processes between our teams through your use of supplier forms, PO Requests, expense reports, and sharing contracts and addendums. This enables me to work more effectively with you and your team. You also make yourself available to me when I have questions. I know that WorkHuman will be great due to your continued attention and dedication to these areas. Thank you!\n\n325#WorkHuman Workhorse!|Jill, I need to take a moment to recognize your amazing work this year on WorkHuman. In the many years of executing this event I've never experienced anything quite as impressive and organized as your execution this year. From selecting strong partners to support us on this journey, to mapping a budget we could all believe in (even Mr. Cromwell!), to creating amazing proposals for sponsorships, to collecting, managing and executing the numerous requests from any number of stakeholders, and already prepping and setting us up for a successful 2019, your work has provided a steady foundation to build this amazing event! For those on the outside who may not see all the intricacies and interdependencies an event of this magnitude requires, your calm demeanor will never let on the level of work you put into this event. I can say, however, I've watched you sweat it out looking for \"couch money\" and your dedication to the success of WorkHuman and Globoforce is second to none. Thank you for your commitment to this event. We'd be lost without you!\n\n326#WH18 Sponsorships|Jill- LinkedIn literally jumped at the opportunity to speak with us further after receiving the proposal today to sponsor WH18!!! I am so excited to continue the conversation tomorrow:) Without you and your numerous conversations about what would work, how it would work and keeping WH Central true to GF, I can honestly say you ROCK! I’m so excited and cannot wait to get this contract signed, sealed and delivered. Even the bedtime story tonight was how LinkedIn was the fairy godmother:) Awesome work!!\n\n327#Wrangling us all|I am beyond impressed Jill at how you never ever forget a detail, a note, a meeting... a PERSON! It is no small feat to wrangle in all of our internal teams and their competing priorities when it comes to WorkHuman and somehow you make it seem so easy. Thank you for being a tremendous support for Alice and I as we work through the entire customer experience. When you work with us on customer things, I truly feel you have your customer hat on and you never skip a beat on their wants, needs, expectations, and of course our restrictions hahah! Someone has to keep us in line. You are incredibly responsive and extremely helpful - always with a smile. I really appreciate all you do Jill. It makes my job that much easier and the customer experience that much better. Thank YOU!\n\n328#WorkHuman Superwoman|Jill, I don’t know how you do it all but I’m very appreciative of your flexibility to make all WH18 logistics flow seamlessly. You’ve listened to my ideas for the speaker reception and along with Shannon are pulling it all together. Mike and I came to you recently with a new idea for after the all attendee reception and you scheduled a call that same week to talk it through with our contacts. There are daily changes with the agenda and with every adjustment you’re there to ensure the logistics piece fits the larger puzzle. Thank goodness for your attention to detail and availability during this busy time!\n\n329#A WorkHuman Holiday|Jill, you are doing such good work planning for and managing WorkHuman 2018, but today I want to recognize all your efforts over the past 10 days to position us for an amazing WorkHuman 2019 and 2020. You've been extremely proactive, working all your relationships to research future venues, and acted fast last week to conduct a 2019 site visit (with Jenn Stevens) just 2 days before Christmas Eve. That last-minute opportunity also opened up another option for 2020 and your \"holiday break\" became a lot of phone calls and emails with me and contract negotiations with our finance and legal teams to get the deal done by year end. The result of your efforts includes truly significant savings for the company and puts us ahead of the curve from a planning perspective. That will allow us to focus on how to scale WorkHuman efficiently and continue to deliver the best HR conference on the planet! A terrific job!\n\n330#Rising to the Plan B Challenge!|Thank you Jill for jumping in to pivot on our plan for the Customer activities in Austin!  There comes a time when we need to mitigate against the risk of the unknown and this week we reached that time!  With the Fairmont still unfinished and a very tight timeline between their targeted finish date and our event we were becoming increasingly nervous about how any unforeseen challenges or their state of finish may impact our customer activities and the overall customer experience.  Thank you for scurrying around over the last week to assist vetting out options and gathering up available sleeping room and conference space at the JW to ensure we deliver a cohesive customer experience and avoid this possible risk!  We now have a great back up option at the JW that should confirm today (fingers crossed) and 2 possible alternative back up plans in the works also!  I know it is tough to have to pivot at a time like this, especially with the mountain of other urgent tasks you have in play concurrently! I want you to know that your efforts have not gone unnoticed!  Thank you!!!\n\n331#Mamma Duck|This recognition is long overdue–but timely because you've done it yet again. I want to thank you for handling the logistics of all of our site visits for WorkHuman! You take such good care of us that I've stopped paying attention to the details. I get on a flight and don't even worry about whether or not there will be a car to pick me up, that my hotel has been handled, that we'll have meals and everything just taken of–I just go wherever you tell me! It takes a lot to plan every meal, flight and agenda item and you do it with such expertise and thoughtfulness. I appreciate every detail that you take on so that I don't have to–it allows me to focus and be present about what I'm here to do. It makes my job so much easier–THANK YOU!!\n\n332#Always willing to help|Jill, I come over and ask you (or IM you) a lot of questions about WorkHuman all the time and you're always so willing to help me out, figure out a way to do whatever I'm looking to do, get me the correct information, or direct me to the correct person. It's always a pleasure and I wanted to make sure you knew it was truly appreciated and the efforts didn't go unnoticed! Thanks for everything.\n\n333#Down to the smallest detail|Jill, I'm so incredibly impressed with the deep level of knowledge you have in every detail of the WorkHuman expenses. As we have been fine tuning the budget each day, you're looking for ways to make expenses more clear, show cost dependencies to everyone on the team, and leverage savings wherever possible. Steve and I are always looking closely at the budget, line by line, and I am lucky to have a partner as invested in the successful execution on budget the way you are. Thanks for all the support you've given over the last few months to get this nailed down!\n\n334#Last Minute Wonders|Thank you for getting me a \"Winning WH\" ticket for HR Tech next week.  Lots of little details to go over with a new booth and this was one item that I had not crossed off my list.  You got me codes, copy, design, and certificates to hand out to anyone that hits that on the wheel  next week.  Thank you!\n\n335#RFP to a T|Jill, Thank you for all the hard work you put into the WorkHuman RFP process this year. You had an organized, thorough, and inclusive plan. It wasn't easy, but your dedication and efforts paid off; we have an engaged partner who is eager to help us create our best event yet. \"Green light!\"\n\n336#Austin 2018 Team Kickoff!|Congratulations on a successful team kickoff this week for WorkHuman 2018 in Austin! This milestone required months of preparation and effort behind the scenes, managing an important RFP process to select a key partner to help us produce the event. Your focus was always on the best outcome for the business and you effectively brought together a Globoforce team to serve as a selection team and outlined important criteria for consideration.  Based on your deep experience in this area and organizational knowledge on how to best complement our internal efforts, we had a rigorous process to make the right choice. Thank you for all these efforts!\n\n337#WorkHuman - Fantastic Collaboration!|I wanted to thank all of you for your excellent ideas, transparency, and new approaches for WorkHuman.  As we get closer to finalizing the strategy for WorkHuman 2018, your collective efforts have helped bring our plan to a new level.  Thank you for your fantastic collaboration.  WorkHuman 2018 is going to be an awesome success - because we're starting it off right and building all the elements from the ground (and crowd!) up.\n\n338#Working WorkHuman with Me|Jill, I want to thank you for always answering my WorkHuman questions for the last few months. This event is a huge undertaking with many moving parts. You answer my questions in a timely manner when I am trying to piece things together and be certain that I have not missed something with respect to the budget. And, you are always willing to meet with me to review where we are at and go over any items that need clarification. I am appreciative for this ongoing teamwork!\n\n339#First in, last out|I noticed. You were the early birds in Phoenix and the last to head home. Thank you for your extended dedication, for giving up your holiday weekend to have the wheels in motion when the Happy Helping Humans arrived. For feeding us, arranging and re-arranging hotel rooms, and answering my 100 questions (times 100!). WorkHuman was a huge success because of YOU!\n\n340#Exceptional Work!|Your work throughout the entire planning and exception phases never let up.  You were 100% on every minute - always thinking of better ways to accomplish a task, better ways to deliver the over all attendee experience, better ways to manage all of the many, many requests that came your way.  I know your work on WorkHuman made it a better conference and better journey for everyone involved.  Your expertise and string knowledge base really was apparent through-out.  And I think you really enjoyed the learning curve - although it was tough, you were up for it and embraced it every time.  I am so, so proud of you! And I really look forward to doing it all over again in 2018!  Congrats!!\n\n341#Customer Experience Core Team!|Thank you for being part of the core team to deliver the Customer Experience at WorkHuman 2017!  Your support and partnership for months leading up to WorkHuman – morning, noon and night- as well as on-site during the event, was critical to the success achieved!  We set our vision, aligned expectations throughout the lead up to the event and delivered on-site as planned! I am so thrilled to have had the honor to work with you fantastic folks!!!  Thank you for your dedication and commitment to making the Customer Experience a success.  We prepared well in advance and we pivoted as needed on site! The feedback from our customers has been fantastic! I am excited to start the planning process for WorkHuman 2018!  I look forward to partnering again with you guys!  You are amazing!!!\n\n342#Queen of 'Getting Sh** done' !|The customer events this year at WorkHuman exceeded our expectations and it could not have been done with you Jill!! Every meeting around customer experience, you were there guiding, suggesting ideas, keeping the team on track, and offering your expertise. At the actual event, you were the \"go-to\" adapting to the situation at hand and making it exactly what it needed to be. You were adjusting and putting the final touches on the customer lounge to ensure it would be a success and it was more than that! Customers were smiling, laughing, networking, having a blast in that lounge. They filled the room, the hall and the veranda during the Happy Hour - what we thought would be 50-60 turned into way over a hundred! Rave reviews!!! Then, the Customer Dinner blew us away (in a good way) when every single chair was filled. The food, the lighting, the music, the presentation - everything went off without a hitch. The Customer Lunch the next day, same thing! Every chair filled with laughing and smiling clients. So much detail goes in to each and every single hour of these events and we would not have pulled it off without you. You have a true talent and I am so appreciative that our customers benefit from it. I love working with you. I hope you know how much I appreciate every bit of what you did for us.\n\n343#Inclusion at it's best!!!!|Mark, Amanda & Jill, you are all such remarkable people!   You made Celine feel like she was a Globoforce employee and a true sense of belonging!   So happy we have this award, as there is no better way to recognize a group of people who made a volunteer/contractor feel like she was part of the team!    \"Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance!\"  Thank you for asking Celine to dance!\n\n344#Last minute registration|Thank you both for the role you played in getting people from the FDIC registered this morning (Fri, May 26). They needed some special assistance getting the paperwork they needed and thanks to Megan for tracking down the right contacts to make this happen and following up to make sure it was complete, and to Jill for taking this on and walking him through the process online to get what he needed. Teamwork! Love it and really appreciate you both making sure this person was taken care of in the Globoforce way.\n\n345#Team up to the Task!|Thank you everyone for helping to pull off Anne Marie's 10th Globo-anniversary surprise party today. Kevin, for supporting the idea and for the meaningful introduction, Lynette for playing off ideas, giving a speech, and being there for her dear friend, Jess K., for your creative touch to the Memory Jar and with stepping up to set up this morning, Jill for your brainstorming and getting the jar during \"All Things WH\", Laury, for always supporting and guiding with everything office related and probably helping with clean up that I was not aware of, Nikki, for jumping in to order the order, Dianne for helping to lead the idea and pick up the beautiful flowers, Sara for always being ready to execute any party plan and for ordering and picking up the balloons this morning, Jess R., for mastering and executing the surprise plan, Angela, for letting me assign her the task of collecting notes, Diane for being a sounding board, Anthony, for rolling up his sleeves to get a record number of notes for the jar on a late Friday afternoon, Amanda, for asking to help and then being there for me to count on her, and Sarah for showing up and being ready to help without being asked.  The bottom line is there were so many people available to help ensure that Anne Marie was recognized in a meaningful way so that we could celebrate this milestone in the office with the team and other colleagues and friends that have been such a big part of her journey. I can only imagine how much it meant to Anne Marie after her dedication to Globoforce and this could not be pulled off without all of you and so many others.\n\n346#Look out, Austin, here we come!|Congrats, Jill, for getting the contract signing for the Austin Convention Center through!  Your hard work, perseverance and patience over the past 6  months has really paid off! Despite slow-downs and road blocks you pushed through and never doubted the end results.  I really appreciate your negotiation skills and ability to know exactly when to push and when to ease back.  I know this is the perfect location for our event next year and thank you for your tremendous efforts!\n\n347#Badges; we definitely need them stinkin'...|As I jump back into helping the team finish up the WorkHuman onsite print stuff, I wanted to say thanks for you willingness to dig into the weeds and get to the bottom of every question I have so we can get each piece finished right. It really shows your dedication to the attendee experience and the event as a whole.\n\n348#So many eyes|Over the past week you've been buried in proofs for notebooks and signs and more. So. Many. Proofs. We're not quite done yet, but 'almost there' feels like the time to share my appreciation for all your time, patience, not running away when you see me chasing you down.... Thank you for using the tool, adapting to it, learning on the fly. I can't wait to see everything printed and enjoyed by all attendees, and to share the group exhale with you! Thank you, teammates.\n\n349#Wayyyyyy Above and Wayyyyyy Beyond!|Jill - your commitment to providing our WorkHuman customer attendees an exceptional experience is tremendous!  From offering Acai bowls and special Phoenix-themed cocktails to a fondue fountain and special place cards, your attention to detail is exceptional. And your creation of a WH baby basket for a big client who cannot attend the event because she will be having a baby, was so creative!  I love that we found the baby clothes so cute that we will be selling them in our bookstore on-site! Thank you for your focus and attention.  I know this will help deliver a terrific experience for our customers.  Can't wait to see everything on site!\n\n350#You Gave it Your All!!|Jill - a huge thank you and congratulations for your efforts in securing the Auston Convention Center as wells the 3 sleeping hotels for WorkHuman 2018! Your never-ending efforts ensured we received the most cost efficient pricing as well as the best space in all of the venues.  I really appreciate you sticking with it over the past 2 months.  Despite bumps and hold ups, you continued to focus on the end goal while keeping Globoforce's best interests tops of mind. Your efforts will touch thousands of our top customers, prospects, and influencer and ensure they have an exceptional experience on-site.  Thank you for a job very, very well done!\n\n351#Nobody solves a problem like Jill!|Jill - your never ending focus, determination and patience around the WH17 planning is nothing short of excellent.  I am continuously impressed with your ability to quickly and effectively find solutions for issues that pop up - from approving our swag to finding hotel rooms to building a baby basket.  You approach each item a clear head, grounded perspective and great ideas.  You are an integral part of this team and I really appreciate your hard work!\n\n352#Bookstore Swag|Thank you for the IMMEDIATE attention on the swag item specs that I needed. The specs were located in different areas, I had 1000 questions at once, and you two were able to answer QUICKLY and re-organize everything in under 5 mins so that I can start my project first thing. WorkFront gets confusing, but your help this morning really kickstarted this project for me. THANK YOU!\n\n353#Sunny Arizona!|Thank you all so much for making my trip to Arizona seamless and so much fun. Your attention to detail to make sure that we all got what we needed, we were meeting about the right things, and all having fun while doing it really meant a lot to me. Thank you so much and I look forward to working with you again.\n\n354#WorkHuman CHRO Outreach Campaign|Team - THANK YOU all so very much for your fabulous work on the WorkHuman CHRO outreach campaign. AMC and Anthony - amazing support creating 9 lists, Jen and Kelli - impactful designs for online and offline assets, Matt and Brian - quick turnaround on a new site and lots of requested changes, Aaron and Dan - fresh, compelling messages for this executive audience, Jill - setting up a custom CHRO registration experience, Stacey - getting the video of Eric done (and then redone), and of course Dianne for keeping us on track and on task! Great teamwork everyone!\n\n355#Quick Turnaround|Jill/Aaron- Amazing job with the quick turnaround for the WH AstraZeneca piece! We quickly chatted about getting them motivated to register and host an onsite meeting and next thing you know I have a well thought out (pretty) piece to send with the \"Originals\" book!  Thank you both again so much!\n\n356#Your the Alpha Best!|Jill,  I can't thank you enough for your attention to detail and quick turnaround in preparing the info we need for a prospect that is looking at sending a large group to WorkHuman.  You not only got me all the info I needed, you went out of your way to get a personalized document for these folks to detail what their experience could be at WH.  thanks for all that you do!\n\n357#Marketing Hackathon Success|Thank you for making the first-ever Marketing Hackathon such a success! You embodied all our core values and the results were fantastic. The two-week Marketing sprint made us more agile as a team, brought out new ideas empowering every member of the team, and we found new approaches to market – ideas that could impact both our marketing approach and our go-to market for opportunities ahead. There was a buzz and vibe around the office that was felt by all your enthusiasm and accomplishment - all the way up the executive chain. Simply put, YOU ROCKED IT! Jess, Jill, and Kevin\n\n358#Code Queen|Jill - I wanted to take a second and thank you for all the work you've done to create and manage the influencer codes in Cvent. There are a lot of them so it is no easy task. You were able to get me their codes and manage the price changes on the back-end so we don't have to go through the entire process again. Thank you!\n\n359#Winner of the top chef|Jill-I had a hard time picking a value-you embodied all of them for this night! John & I enjoyed working with you for your final Wine Wisdom & Working Human NYC event ... And you were at your best! Everything was spectacular - what a venue & so very impressive . Every detail was managed perfectly & orchestrated behind the scenes with perfection ! You knew it would work ! Your partnership with John and I from the start was so appreciative & you knew exactly our style & what would -- the Globoforce branded spice packets were such a hit! The room full of prospects raved all evening -- so thank you thank you. It was a pleasure!! ~Allison & John\n\n360#Letting Me Tag Along|Jill, thank you for taking time out today to go over my Workhuman Tagging project that I am working on linking Cvent to Salesforce for WH registrant prospects. I felt like I needed to look at things more closely and you were there to help me with it as soon as I asked for assistance. I really appreciate your time and sharing of knowledge today.\n\n361#Master of coordinating|Hi Jill,  A big thank you for all of you have coordinated in the last few weeks for the WWW NYC #3 to be successful. There were a few date changes that you mastered like a pro. And a big thanks for working to get the invites out the door. We always have a lot of moving parts, and you always just get it done. We look forward to packing the room! ~Allison & John\n\n362#Working it out..humanly!|Jill - Thank you so much for taking the time to review all of the customer WorkHuman 17 registrations we have to date with me.   After going through some of the records, I realized that there were certain customers who had registered but weren't flagged as customers in the system.  You patiently and diligently went through each registration and made sure they were correctly categorized and also established a process to accurately flag new customer registrants.  Because of you, we can  now target promotions to the right people and increase customer attendance to the event.  Thank you!\n\n363#Getting it done!|Hey Team -  A big (overdue) THANKS to all of you for your efforts to get the first draft of the Persona/Message Maps done earlier this month.  I know the task was challenging - especially for those of us who are relatively new to GF.  I realize that this task fell outside the scope of what the Demand Center is typically responsible for, and you all embraced it with a sense of purpose.  I was impressed at the amount of research that you all did; the collaborating; sharing of resources; and the dedication to giving it your best shot.  We collectively produced A LOT of really good content that is now under review by Product Marketing.  When all is said and done, this will be an incredibly valuable asset for multiple functions across the company.\n\n364#First WorkHuman Regional Forum|Well that's another first accomplished today as we completed our first WorkHuman regional forum in New York City. There was such a lot of prep work went into organizing these events. I truly appreciate the work you did as a team to ensure the Agenda was the right mix of inspiration and action - that we could deliver a unique experience and still ensure social recognition is front of mind. I believe we achieved that mix. There are things we learn from doing anything for the first time which will strengthen the next events. Great job on shaping the space to be more WorkHuman like and on securing great customers and outside speakers. I'd say we have a nice New York WorkHuman community building. Great job everyone\n\n365#Event Management Leadership|Thank you to my amazing team for taking ownership of the many different aspects of the WorkHuman Regional Forums. You are all doing a spectacular job managing your pieces to a tight deadline and budget, while also keeping everyone up to speed and on schedule. This project has so many moving parts, spanning many cities, multiple teams, outside speakers, customers, vendors, hotels, and partners; and I know it's going to be huge success due to your dedication and effort. Great work Jen on promotion/sales comms, Jenn on logistics, Jill on creative, and Krista on content!\n\n366#Making a List, Checking it Twice|Jill, In the time leading up to and during WH, you took on a lot of additional responsibilities. Yet, you have been on top of getting paperwork to me or following up on my requests in a timely manner. On top of this, you were able to determine that we were charged for a service that was not delivered and GF will be getting a refund for that. Well done Jill!\n\n367#Instant Photos, Instant Successes|Thank you for helping me with the WorkHuman and ADP conference raffle prize winners. You quickly and expertly organized the details to send the camera prizes to our multiple winners, packaged up the cameras, created hand-written notes, and sent the packages to our prospects. I know the winners will be very excited to receive their cameras. And, with your teamwork, our prospects will receive their prize while the conference \"buzz\" is still with them!\n\n368#WorkHuman Success!|Well done Humans! What an incredible success our WorkHuman event was this year! It is the pinnacle event of our year. It’s the culmination of all the work we do throughout the year on delivering thought leadership to our community.    I know you have all worked tirelessly for months to deliver an event that amazes, delights and inspires. The execution of every part of the event was fantastic. From the agenda and speakers to the amazing graphics and hotel set up. I appreciate the co-ordination it takes to pull all of this off and I thank all of you for your contribution.   Only a team this talented and united could execute such a big task so flawlessly.   The feedback at the event and after has been overwhelming. It was an unbridled success. It had impact far beyond our typical business objectives in that it moved hearts and minds - in a way that was inspirational. Just one quote from one of the many amazing pieces of feedback - “Exposure to the goodness of your company and the passion for humanity within this conference provided the force of 1 million flowers at a critical time in my life”. Wow.  You are WorkHuman.   Congratulations and Thank you!\n\n369#Toronto Wine & Wisdom SUCCESS!|Who say's QUALITY and QUANTITY can't go hand in hand?   Not I!!!  Cause this team KNOCKED it out of the park last night at the Toronto Wine & Wisdom!     The quality of the event was amazing and the quantity of people was great!  29 people registered, 24 people attended, 3 of the 5 big banks, 18 prospects, 4 customers and 2 bloggers!  To quote China \"this is the best W&W yet!\" (and Chris I won't believe that she says that to everyone, LOL)  Thank you all!  We couldn't have done it without you!  WE ARE NORTH\n\n370#Accenture WorkHuman Basket|Jill, Thank you so much for putting together the basket of WorkHuman novelties for my contact who is unable to make it to Orlando next week. She was looking so forward to going but a personal issue made that impossible. You were so helpful in making the WorkHuman experience possible for this individual while the conference is going on. I know she'll appreciate the effort and most importantly be an advocate for Globoforce. Michael\n\n371#QBR Success!|Thank you all for your involvement in our Eastern QBR last week!   Your presence and participation helped gear me and our entire team for success this quarter!    We all walked away with some solid action items that will contribute to our success this quarter!  We will win TOGETHER as a Team!\n\n372#Target Account Wonderwoman|Jill- I walked through the marketing area first thing this morning, and saw a bunch of beautiful baskets that were full of great goodies, and Pam let me know that you had built them all, for a targeted account effort for BofA (with a quick turn around time). I then found out that you had gone out and sourced all the stuff (including going out and shopping locally yourself to buy the baskets) and hand picking all the cool items that go inside. Later this afternoon, I walked through again to find you carefully packing and boxing them all up yourself to get shipped out. I am just so impressed at the high quality personal touch that you put on everything you do, not to mention producing all of these baskets start to finish, and getting them all out the door yourself. Great work, great quality, great commitment to making sure our prospects get our best efforts!\n\n373#Stepping into WH|Jill, thanks for stepping in to help with our WH event logistics. I've heard only positive comments about your contribution and how you have left no stone unturned. I truly appreciate your flexibility in allowing us to tap into your events experience.\n\n374#Thank you for your help with Evanta!|Jill, Thank you for your help organizing our Evanta events this year. You have been the key contact and have been extremely responsive to our Evanta reps to make sure we do not miss any deadlines for submitting important material. It was extremely helpful that you took charge to facilitate speakers and collected all the necessary information in a timely manner. It has been great working with you!\n\n375#Marketing QBR Prep!|A huge thank you for helping to prepare the demand gen marketing QBR presentation! I had MANY requests for data, visuals, and anecdotal information, and I truly appreciate you turning it around so quickly. All of these requests came together to show impressive Q1 results as well as a great list of 2016 initiatives ready to go in the next few weeks. Go Team Demand Center!!!\n\n376#Wine Wisdom &WorkHuman NYC = Wonderful|Jill - As I get home after an amazing event in NYC with 35 attendees I wanted to take a moment and say thanks for the amazing job you did to make this event rock.  You choice of \"The Modern\" was fantastic as the service, wine selection, and food were all of the highest quality.  People were greeted by your smiling face and all of the hours that you put into making this event so successful were evident this evening.  Well done and I can't wait to plan the next one with you!!!  Already getting thank you notes from attendees on my drive home!\n\n377#Stuff of Legends|Team - just a quick thank you for the work all three of you did this week to ensure that the physical invitations to the NYC WW&W event FINALLY got out the door.  Manually stuffing, labeling, and taking almost 300 packages to the post office does not sound like too much fun but this kind of dedication will help to ensure we continue to grow the attendance at our great NYC event.  So much appreciated and we will get some solid prospects from this event!  Thanks.\n\n378#Field Marketing here we go!|Jen and Jill, I am extremely impressed with your collaboration and teamwork as we kick off our Q1 and Q2 events for field marketing. Working with you guys on our sporting events and Wine and Wisdoms has truly been a pleasure. We are off to a great start and I know these field events will help push the needle. I look forward to working more closely with the both of you as we scale and the demand for your events grow! Keep up the great work guys!!!\n\n379#Communicate, Collaborate and Create|Jill - I just wanted to say thank you for organizing the needs for Field Marketing events for the rest of the year so that creative can best plan our resources to help you meet your goals. I truly appreciate the WorkFront updates, as well as our mini-meetings, brainstorms and creative review sessions that help to keep ideas fresh and deliverables on time. THANK YOU!\n\n380#Power to the process|Just wanted to give  a shout out about that awesome process meeting! No one loves a meeting about process, but it was great to get in a room and figure out the best way to make the process work for everyone.

In particular, you held an important meeting with our team to make sure we were involved an able to make phone calls to drive attendance, and the idea has paid off and worked! It's not easy to have these events be successful, it take a lot of prospecting and if we didn't have proper coordination internally, we'd be lost.

We began this WorkHuman journey together 6 months ago and the results of everyone's hard work, perseverance, dedication, passion and commitment was evident leading up to the conference and definitely throughout the conference. The conference was the most visually appealing I have ever been to. Our content and program was powerful and motivational, our social media outreach was phenomenal, Workhuman central was interactive and provided great networking opportunities. The onsite teamwork shown by the blue team, registration team and all of our greeters was very personal and friendly. I couldn't have been more proud to have such a great group of humans to take this journey with.
