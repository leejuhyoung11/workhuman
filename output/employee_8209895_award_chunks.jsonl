"0#R-R Core Team!|Core Rolls-Royce launch team, I wanted to extend my sincere appreciation for all of the thought, care, effort that you've put into this launch. From day one, it was clear that this launch would be going ahead in October even with all of the work and coordination that had to happen to make that a reality. Sinéad, Brenda, Dinorah, and Sarah, you all absolutely blew me away with the massive amount of time you committed to helping the R-R comms team with round after round of edits on the communications materials. You also acted as project managers on the comms side of the house, coordinating resources and ensuring that the comms plan and execution stayed on track. Aidan, Cliona, and Ihar, the branding workstream was the smoothest one during this launch project, largely due to your quick responses and easy collaboration with Justin and Kelly; thank you so much for making Power of You look and feel great! Brian and Niall, thank you both for sticking with me as we worked through some interesting technical challenges, and worked to put in place a support model that will be sustainable post-Launch! In particular, Brian, you were so generous with your time on this one, helping me to accommodate many check-ins. James, Marie, and Clare, many thanks to the three of you for providing both tactical and strategic input and insight, helping us get this project over the finish line. Well done to all, and Phase 2 here we come!\n\n1#Relationships Matter - Making Impact Across bp|How we interact, converse, show up and share insights matters and culminates into a lasting impact.  Marie did just that with the SVP of Rewards and Wellbeing at bp and no better way to celebrate that than to share his exact words sent her way:   \"I have been immensely fortunate to have worked with many external partners over the many years and for that I will be ever grateful. Success inside a company is in no small measure due to immense external partners like you. You stand TALL amongst them. Thank YOU Marie for all of your support and the many engaging conversations and pieces of work we did together. They will forever remain etched in my memory\"  It has been an absolute pleasure to work with you.   Thank you Marie for continuing to not only create executive level contacts but forge genuine relationships that drive business impact!\n\n2#Dublin PMLL - EMEA domination!|A huge thank you to everyone who made the PM Learning Lab in Dublin such an incredible success! This was our largest EMEA-based Lab yet with 18 customers, representing 14 nationalities across 4 continents, truly a global Program Manager Learning Lab.   To our dynamic presenters Traci, Lynette, and Gabby — I didn’t need to physically be in the session to know & feel the energy, passion, expertise, and storytelling you delivered to our guests and colleagues! The in-room NPS of 9.5 says it all!    To Adam — You “brought it” on both sides of the pond! Thank you for representing Product and being such an advocate for our customers, understanding them and speaking their language!   To Allie and Sophia — your behind-the-scenes magic (x2) put on an incredible show once again! From logistics to flow to flawless execution, you thought through every detail. Customers like National Grid, JESA, Circet, and bp shared incredible feedback, including: “I know this takes a lot of planning and execution. Workhuman makes it look easy and seamless.”   And to our dedicated CE Team members, who support our customers day-in and day-out  —  Thank you for welcoming your customers, preparing them for the session, joining in discussions, and helping them build actionable 3-2-1 priorities. These included providing more executive insight into program ROI, more storytelling around program culture, greater use of data-driven insights, and more “meet users where they’re at” integrations — all advancing executive conversations, demonstrating impact, and aligning with company strategic initiatives. Your partnership ensures every customer walks away inspired and ready to elevate their programs. This event showcased what happens when passion, preparation, and purpose come together.   Can’t wait to carry this energy forward into our 2026 Learning Labs and continue showing what Recognition Done Right looks like!\n\n3#Lloyds launch core team|Hi team, as I reflect on the launch of Lloyds, I feel nothing but gratitude for this team, who truly rallied to bring this client to where they are today.   Kevin, thank you for being a fantastic technical resource and helping me keep the project moving on the technical side. What I appreciate most is your care—how you were able to pivot, accommodate last-minute requests, and keep things progressing.  Adrian, thank you for being there every step of the way, lending your voice when needed, and helping Lloyds understand the impact of the decisions they were being asked to make once live. Jose, thank you for lending your voice and offering your expertise to help us drive important points home. Your guidance on how to approach different topics and set the customer up for success was invaluable.  Joyce, thank you for sharing your consulting expertise at the start of the project—especially when we were discussing spend admin and the best strategy. Lloyds would not have reached this point without the strong foundation you helped us build. Sinead, thank you so much for helping Lloyds understand how we approach recognition, how technology and communication could meet to support their launch, and why each decision mattered, and how to communicate it effectively.  Marie, it’s been an absolute pleasure having you on this journey. What I appreciate most is your ability to read the room perfectly and help me keep the Lloyds team focused on our mission—launching them. The way you've always presented that something could be addressed after launch, and that you would be there to support them was amazing.  I could spend a whole day writing a full essay to thank this team, and it still wouldn’t be enough to express my gratitude.\n\n4#Rolls-Royce: It Takes a Village|Team, I wanted to thank you all for your teamwork and resilience over the last few weeks, as we've gone through some initial stages of the Rolls-Royce launch project. This is a large, complex, political client and we've had to do a lot of pivoting and strategizing to make sure we're putting our best foot forward as we work to meet the client's needs and expectations. Emily and James, I appreciate you keeping everyone informed about progress on the Sales side of things. Jose, Rich, Guil, Marie, and Niall, thank you for coming to the weekly internal meetings with your sleeves rolled up, ready to lend a hand as needed. Nuvs, you've been so helpful with your Product knowledge and experience as the client has come at us with various off-the-beaten-path requests. Brian, Brenda, Sinead, Dinorah, and Clare, thank you all for the copious amount of help with various time-sensitive requests like demo recordings, PLT update decks, working session strategy, etc. This one is going to truly take a village, and I'm so happy to have you all as my partners on this one.\n\n5#Rolls Royce Design Lab Success!|I wanted to celebrate the wonderful collaboration and connections formed at the Rolls Royce Design Lab. From meeting Zahra (CHRO) to discussing specific Works Councils, this Design Lab really had something for everyone! This was exemplified in their wonderful questions and interest, led of course by great facilitation.  Brenda, you set a great tone for the meeting, led with fluidity and managed to get lots of answers and insights from the RR team. Kat, your explanation of the technical workstreams was crystal clear, as were your reminders for people to turn on their mics when speaking!!

Looking forward to building on this great work as we move through launch!\n\n6#And Wait. . . There is More!|Caitlin, Christina, Dave, Janet, Marie, Mike, Samar and Susan,  Taking on more when there is already more that has been asked of you, is never what anyone wants to hear or have to do, yet each and everyone of you rose to the occasion of adding an account to your portfolio.  What is so impressive is the grace and can do lens you approached this addition to your book of business at the mid year.   I appreciate how you are quick to act and own the account, partner with the CSM's, get meetings on the books, step into an account review that was already on the books with minimal notice, take over strategic initiatives already in play and most importantly show your level of business acumen for getting up to speed and driving strategy in a swift manner.  Thank you team!!\n\n7#The end of an era|Marie, I wanted to call out what a fantastic partner you have been on Cisco. We worked together on this account for 5.5 YEARS and built up an incredible customer relationship. I'm happy we will still continue to partner together, just in a different manner. I'll miss our weekly catchups and strategizing together, but I know the account is in a fantastic place with Kristine. Thank you for your collaboration, professionalism, and friendship. Cheers!\n\n8#Cicso for the Renewal!!!|Marie - thank you for the continued partnership you cultivate with Cisco!  They are early adopters, great advocates and strong partners, as a result of your efforts they continue to believe in the power of Workhuman!

This is a true testament to the work you do in partnership with Cisco!

Claire and Kristine - no account renews without the ongoing support you provide to our PM's and your insights to navigating an account of this size and all its multiple nuances.   Thank you for being great partners on the journey!\n\n9#Heart & Hustle|To everyone who traveled to Denver and rolled up their sleeves to support our flagship event—thank you.  There are dozens of jobs, big and small, that need to come together to make an event like this work—and you did them all. From demo delivering to activation staffing, room management to speaker wrangling, customer hosting to Gratitude Bar support—every task you took on was vital to the experience we delivered.  Your energy, flexibility, and willingness to step in wherever needed didn’t go unnoticed. This event’s success was built on your hard work, and we are deeply grateful for everything you gave—your time, your effort, your talent, and your care.  Thank you for showing up, again and again. You made this event possible.\n\n10#Changing the Game at Lloyd's Bank!|Worst thing about the Lloyd’s Design Lab? Forgetting the team photo! Best thing? Game Changers program name confirmed! JK, the best part was you! Whether pictured in the photo or not, you’re all Game Changers who’ve made a difference to Lloyd’s employees worldwide with a successful partnership kick-off.  Great job, Roxy, clearly aligning yourself with the strategy and comms work, and snagging some 1:1 time with Emma. That’s the magic of being in-person – way to seize it!

Your commitment to being virtual for the duration is a strong signal to Lloyd's about your commitment to them long-term.   Always a treat to work alongside you, Jose. Your savviness in considering how all the variables come together to create a strong program for Lloyd’s was so valuable. Love that directness and will forever chuckle at your response to my working lunch suggestion!  Alex, you helped land key points by tethering the discussion to previous convos with Lloyd's and reminding them why they chose us. The experience felt like a smooth handoff from a trusted advisor. Extra thanks for the space and catering arrangements!  Well done, Team LBG!\n\n11#Details Matter for Creating Moments that Matter!|When we celebrate a moment that matters it is not just the gift that culminates into a truly meaningful moment but how that moment is personalized.  Marie, you did just that with your special in person delivery to BP's HQ for Kerry's 15th Anniversary.   Way to live our value of Respect for Customers and seize the opportunity to make this moment more personal for a key executive contact.

Thank you for your effort and customer focus.\n\n17#Cisco is bringing a team!|Amazing teamwork by this integrated group to get Cisco on board for Workhuman Live.  Kathryn, getting customer speakers signed up is always a challenge.  Kudos for getting Kelly from Cisco on board for a panel at Live.  Marie, you took the speaking opportunity to propose a team of 15 and made it happen!  Just awesome. Nicole, you immediately responded to the urgency of getting Cisco an invoice created so they could pay (that day!) to meet their quarter end deadline (which you found out on your way home from the airport after a week long site visit).

Bryant - I took note at the end of the QBR's in October that you specifically raised your hand and said \"I need to make a bigger deal out of the Store to my clients\" - I love seeing you follow through on that commitment! Thank you!\n\n20#The Trifecta of Great Relationship managemen at bp|Marie -  Your efforts at bp to coordinate multiple VP level attendees at our business review proved incredibly beneficial to further understanding the Year of Transformation bp has ahead.   Additionally, you capitalized on the business review moment but setting up time with the new executive sponsor and VP of Total Rewards to have a one off meeting ahead of the business review where we gained further intel prior to the meeting.   Then to round out this trifecta you also leveraged the WH Executive Sponsor, to meet with the CHRO.  The level of detail and coordination of the incredible team at Workhuman showed during the presentation and no one missed a beat.  Thank you for making sure this review was well executed, the status of the business understood and our next steps for continued partnership defined.   Hearing so many members of the executive team demonstrate genuine interest in this program and wanting to further the conversation around analytics, showing interest in attending Workhuman live and wanting to have follow up meetings to action the ideas discussed is a great example of strong relationships and a flourishing partnership.  Kudos to you, Marie.\n\n21#Designing the best Product with our customers|Congratulations to the amazing team for successfully launching Workhuman’s Design Partnership Program, a critical step in our product evolution. The partnership allows select clients to collaborate directly with our product and engineering teams to develop innovative features. This initiative fosters deeper client relationships and provides valuable user insights, enhancing product quality and smoothing the transition from Early Access (EA) to General Availability (GA) for our iQ product.  This team has been instrumental in activating Lam this week as the first formal design partner, marking a pivotal moment in strengthening one of our most important client relationships and a step in bringing the AI Assistant to the market. This effort directly enhances product quality and reduces friction for a smoother, more successful GA launch. It is genuinely a significant win for Workhuman and our clients. Thank you for your dedication and partnership in making this happen!\n\n22#Workhuman Receives Distinguished Supplier Award|Cisco Supplier Day  On September 26th Cisco held their annual Supplier Day at their headquarters in San Jose, CA to celebrate the top 100 of their more than 10,000 suppliers. Exceptionally, Workhuman was one of these chosen suppliers. Marie received the “Distinguished Supplier Award” on behalf of the wonderful team at Workhuman who helps Cisco embrace being more human every day. This event was developed by the Procurement Department and led by the Chief Procurement Officer, with a focus on Cisco’s long and short term company goals.   Executives from Cisco were intermingled with all the suppliers, which gave Marie the opportunity to dive even deeper into the culture of Cisco. Cisco is in the process of reviewing their software providers and having one sole provider for each category of need. Workhuman is the provider they have CHOSEN for Reward and Recognition. Workhuman is seen as a supplier that distinguishes themselves by going above and beyond in service partnership and operational excellence in one or more key areas or projects and for our innovative ideas.   A segment of the program for the day was Ted Kezios, SVP People Care @ Cisco, speaking about their tremendous reward and recognition program and what their data has told them about recognition. It coincides with all the ROI points that our WHiQ team has published throughout the years regarding higher engagement levels and lower attrition. It was incredible to sit with the executives at Cisco and listen to them tout how much they utilize and love their Connected Recognition program. Not just to Marie but to all the attendees!!  Lastly, Ted stated, “we cherish our partnership”. This was an award in and of itself because it shows precisely what we strive for with all our clients, a cherished partnership.  Kudos Marie, Claire, Jessica, & Casey who so diligently works on making Cisco a Cherished Partnership!\n\n23#Cisco and Unleash|Marie, thank you so much for getting Cisco to speak at Unleash. You have always been a fierce supporter of having customers at events. It’s fantastic. You understand the value of these relationships and having the face time with customers.

Thank you!\n\n24#Appreciate you!|A bit late but would be remiss if I didn't give you a shout out for everything you do every day and the partnership we have built! Truly appreciate you and the work you do!\n\n25#Grateful for your dedication to our clients|Marie, Samar & Paul - It's amazing to see your dedication to our clients and unwavering commitment to demonstrating our value through the lens of what is most important to them.  Thank you for your creative problem solving and tenacity. I also appreciate your willingness to help me get up to speed on WH over the last few months. I’m grateful to have you on our team and appreciate all you do!\n\n26#Wrapping up FY24 at Cisco|Marie, amazing work in orchestrating and running the FY24 business review with Cisco! You were very thoughtful about what we presented to them, staying innovative and relevant. It was clear by the types of questions Amber and Jen were asking they were engaged in what we were discussing. The meeting also opened up no less than ten action items, leading us to lots of opportunity in the future. We had so much to celebrate in FY24 and to date: Cisco winning the prestigious Luminary Award at WHL, Eric's fireside chat at Cisco, locking in multiple speaking engagements with Gloria, Roxanne and Amber - and that is on top of the FOUR additional programs we've launched since May (plus 1 in the queue!) and Cisco launching tons of new program functionality. I think we've maybe been just a little bit busy!?! I very much appreciate having you as a strategic partner on this account and you've done such an incredible job building a strong relationship with Cisco that continues to open new doors for us every day. Well done my friend, cheers to you!\n\n27#Successful Invest Segment QBR|I wanted to thank each and every one of you for your focus and commitment to our first ever Invest segment QBR!  The collaboration and sharing of ideas to help move the business forward and outline some key takeaways to action towards increased investment was fantastic.  The commitment to our customers and their needs is very apparent in each of your spirits and how you show up for them daily and internally at Workhuman.  We recognize the change in focus and alignment into the segments may take a little longer to smooth completely out, but the commitment to each other and the needs of the business to grow were evident in how each of you showed up.  We want to continue the great momentum as we finish out H1 and head into H2.  Thank you for inspiring me as a leader and for the dedication and focus that is needed as we move forward to making 2024 an incredible year.  Way to go Invest team!\n\n28#Celebrating the Launch of Intern Assessments at bp|I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the incredible collaboration on this project. The concept for the Intern Assessment experience was developed last year and officially launched on Tuesday, May 28th. Once again, bp is showing their trust in Workhuman as they expand their Performance Reflections program to interns. I'm truly grateful for everyone's hard work and dedication to making this project a success. Let's celebrate!\n\n29#Spectacular Leadership at bp|Marie, I wanted to congratulate you on another spectacular meeting at bp!  You have a true gift in cutting through all the noise and quickly decerning what needs to be done at our customers and with exact precision.  You have built incredible relationships at bp, which has been a critical to understanding what is coming around the corner and how to get ahead, especially with the SVP, Total Rewards, Ashok Pillai.  With the reorg of People & Culture at bp upon us, you quickly stepped in and have built trust with Rupert Wilder, who is stepping into the SVP role.  Your vast partnerships over the life of the account have served you well as you had already known him since the very beginning - remarkable as you know very well that we never know who is going to be leading next!  You knew going into this meeting that highlighting the bright spots and illuminating where the future can go for them with performance management through Conversations was critical build trust.  The data you had the team deliver was spot on!  They were impressed by how we can assist them in making their performance management even stronger, delivering data that supports their progress in their journey and where we are headed in all their roadmap concerns and needs.  Wholistically, you have an incredible grasp on what matters most to bp with the new CEO stepping in and have quickly aligned your goals and strategies to those things.  Tremendous effort leading the team to deliver an incredible meeting Marie!\n\n30#Celebrating Cisco!|Marie – Where to even start with how incredible your relationship is with our partners at Cisco!  The work you have done to create and build this partnership over the last 6 years is remarkable.  They are raving fans, willing to try new things and always at the front of the line to promote Workhuman and that is in very large part to your leadership!  This year, Gloria Goins, the CDO from Cisco, showed up ready to share her immense insights and inspiring so many with her passion.  She was incredibly moving and on the flip side, she was incredibly moved by her experience.  My favorite things she shared with us was “I’m going to tell Kelly (CHRO) how much she missed, and she will be so jealous!” and “This was my first Workhuman Live and it won’t be my last, I’ll be here next year”.  What a powerful statement.  Next, you got Amber McCarty-Howe (Senior Director of People Experience) and Roxanne Bisby Davis (Head of People Intelligence) to speak to the vast impact that Connected Recognition has had on their culture.  There is nothing more powerful than a customer like Cisco doing their own research and sharing how recognition is impacting their culture, employee well being and beyond.  And last but not least, they were the Luminary award winners this year and were so touched and proud to be recognized in the way there were.  I am so very proud of the work you’re doing Marie, Bravo!\n\n31#You set the tone - and a high bar!|Can I get a WHOOT WHOOT for our amazingly talented Breakout Session Announcers?? From those who I roped into this role as already seasoned professionals, to those first timers who were specifically requested by a session speaker because yes, you are JUST THAT GOOD, each one of you rocked it! This job requires poise, energy, guts, focus and a personal touch and I can't thank you enough for bringing all of that to the room, our speakers and our attendees. As openers, you set the tone and the vibe in the room - and while your \"speech\" might have been short & sweet - the impact is large. You also made each of our speakers feel comfortable, prepared, and I'm sure gave a few of them a run for their money.

They truly see you as a strategic advisor and on more than several occasions have raved about how much they love Workhuman and our partnership. I enjoy our weekly check-ins discussing what is happening with Cisco or digging into who we need to pull into the latest initiative. 2024 is already starting off with a bang with at least four ad hoc calls on the books to dive into the latest projects!

This is the second Reflections template we created for this customer. I want to thank the team behind this project for their outstanding work. With the release, bp can access Reflections Admin and the sticky filter functionality for the first time. The customer program team often complimented our efforts with this implementation.  Not to toot our own horn, but WE DID IT!!!\n\n39#bp Renewal for 3 Years!|Marie, Truly incredible job renewing the bp contract for another 3 years!!!!!  This was a very challenging renewal, but you maneuvered with grace, determination and fortitude.  You have been so in tune with where all of the challenges that could and did spring up, which shows how astute you are as a sales leader. The relationships you have built with bp's leadership are so unparalleled and I couldn't be more proud of the work you do everyday to keep this customer front and center.  You consistently stayed one step ahead and pushed all the right buttons and pulled all the right levers to ensure we ended up with the best possible outcome and a continued strong partnership with bp.  I am beyond proud of you!\n\n40#Edwards - Here for another 5 years!|Marie - This is long overdue - massive congratulations on a 5-year renewal for Edwards!  You went from preparing for them going out to bid to turning this around and creating an amazing relationship with the procurement person and renewing the relationship - not for one year or three years, but for 5 years!  This has been a challenging customer to keep in check and you have demonstrated masterful leadership here Marie.  Cheers to you and another five years with Edwards!\n\n41#Driving Focus for Q4 & 2024|Team I wanted to thank you all for coming prepared to truly imagine where we take our largest customers next.  We spent the last couple of days ideating on how we can continue to grow investment, expand our buyers, elevate our thought leadership, and bring the best WH has to offer.  I appreciate all the thought you’re putting into each customer and the dedication to look beyond the obvious while also being there to have each other’s back.  Let’s keep the focus going to end the year strong and be prepared to go into 2024 more focused and proactive than ever before.  Cheers to this amazing group of fierce humans – I’m so incredible proud of each of you and feel so grateful to get to work alongside you every day!\n\n42#Illuminating and Inspiring at Cisco|Marie – Let’s start with this quote from a Cisco employee, “Connected Recognition is one of the most precious assets at Cisco!”  The leadership you bring to the Cisco partnership is honestly one for the record books.  When you took on this account 6 years ago, they were a Visa Gift Card and Amazon only program.  Over the past 6 years, you have grown them to a $45M+ partnership and today they have almost all of the Workhuman Cloud turned on, new programs bubbling up all over the place and more on the horizon.  On Wednesday, Eric’s keynote on Gratitude was delivered to 89K Cisco employees around the world – Eric joining the ranks of speakers like Oprah Winfrey and a Workhuman favorite, Michelle Obama!  Your keen ear and visionary mind brought that moment and experience to life for us. If that wasn’t monumental enough, you parlayed that into another, yes another, analytics partnership with Cisco in which Eric will be back in February to continue spreading our vision.  Cisco has repeatedly been at the top of the best places to work list and they look to us as their partner in crime to building a culture that is award worthy.  Amber Howe-McCarty from Cisco says it the best…” In this very busy world we live in, this was a wonderful reminder of what’s important.  And we wouldn’t be here if not for the collaboration and partnership with the Workhuman team.  Our work has grown considerably over the last few years because of the close partnership we’ve developed with your team and our shared values.  Our culture is a foundational part of our company.  Having a partner that shares these values is critical. We have big goals and dreams about where to take recognition at Cisco.  We look forward to continuing on this journey together.”  Massive congratulations to you and I couldn’t be prouder of you and your amazing talents!\n\n43#So Thankful for All of You!|In honor of World Gratitude Day, I am beyond Grateful for each of you!  Your unique perspectives, dedication and commitment are what make Workhuman amazing for not only myself, but our customers and your fellow colleagues.  I am so proud of the work you are doing and it is noticed every single day.  Thank you all for inspiring me and challenging what great looks like.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n44#Crushing it with Cisco|Marie, what a year we have had so far with Cisco! I can't even count all the amazing accomplishments we have had with this customer, but there have been so many! We identified just a handful of them on the recent account review: Connected Cisco Relaunch​, Product Feature Enhancements, ICX Program Launch​, Human Comms Launch​, getting a group to attend Workhuman Live​, Gratitude Challenge​, Quarterly Strategy Sessions​ and MORE. We have multiple calls with Cisco a week and are always working together to pull in the right internal folks to hear out whatever Cisco wants to talk about (because we know they have the best ideas and are ahead of the curve) and are always trying our best to improve their program and do what is best for Cisco employees. You have such a fantastic relationship with Cisco - they certainly see you as a trusted advisor and really feel like you listen to them. Thanks for all your contributions to the recent Strategy Session and Account Review - the feedback from Cisco was resoundingly positive all around. It's so great to partner together on this account - well done my friend!\n\n45#QBR- Driving Excellence for our Customers|Wow- I have to say a huge thank you to all of you for showing up to QBRs, bringing your best ideas, ideating together and continuing to push the envelope on what excellence looks like for our customers.  While I know we feel a bit in defense mode lately, all of you are still staying focused on how best to increase investments across our customers, create epic moments that deliver a truly special connection with Workhuman and elevating the conversations with Executives at our largest customers.  I know leading our largest customers is a big job, tons of responsibility and sometimes thankless, but I see you and all that you’re doing each and every day to bring the best to our customers and Workhuman.  I love having the time together to connect, learn from each other, laugh, celebrate our families and so much more. You all bring so much joy to me and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you do.  Cheers to each of you and I can’t wait to see our ideas come to life.\n\n46#To an incredible job well done!|WOW! What an incredible customer panel at WHL Regional forum in London!  It was an amazing endorsement of our platform, experience and results!  Both BP and Sanofi could not have been more positive and complimentary about Workhuman’s recognition program at each of their companies and it’s a testament to just how dedicated, professional and willing to go above and beyond each of you are to deliver this superior customer experience.  You just don’t hear this kind of resounding endorsement about other software vendors – in fact, Nathalie at BP even corrected herself from calling us a vendor, changing her word choice to partner!  So many of you were personally shouted out from the main stage and you all have had a critical role to play in making these customers true advocated and sponsors of Workhuman.  THANK YOU for all you do for BP, Sanofi and so many more of our key customers!!\n\n47#Making Magic at WHL London|A huge shout out to each of you for bringing Customers to the London WHL Event!  It was a very cool day of inspiration and building connections with our extended executives across our customers.  Each of you worked diligently to create a meaningful experience for your customers in attendance, brought WH Executives over to meet them and set forth the next steps in keeping them engaged with WH and their programs.  I was beyond proud to see the level of leadership you not only brought to the customers, but in how you represented our organization.  The work we do is hard and challenging and each of you make it look effortless. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to our customers.  It is so evident, and I couldn't be more thrilled to see it in action.  Brava!\n\n48#Energizing and Amazing Momentum at bp!|What an incredible experience it was to join all of you at bp and watch you bring your expertise and commitment to the customer!  Marie, your incredible leadership kicked it off strong and was so evident throughout the conference and this amazing meeting.  I loved that Nathalie, VP sent you a not thanking you I quote: \"Thank you for a great meeting!  Great to learn more about the product roadmap, meet Alan, and feeling well listened to in terms of what we need.  Thank you to the team in general for a great update - very good!\" Alan, amazing job hitting the high points of the incredible data set you put together and inspiring them to do more because of it.  Guil, always so positive and on point with the program and how they are performing.  It is so apparent all the great work you are doing with them daily,  that positive momentum is what is so spectacular. Jose, it is clear they think so highly of you and your partnership means so much. Always a consistent and trusting partner to them.  Jen, it was so cool to see your passion in action.  You knew all of the ins and outs of the Conversations/Focus@bp program and it was so clear. Can't wait to hear how the follow up meeting goes.  I am beyond proud of the entire team and the work you do daily.  It certainly showed on stage with Nathalie singing your praises.  Bravo to you all!\n\n49#WHL Forum - An Only Workhuman Can Do Event!|Team, I want to express my sincere appreciation and take a moment to recognize you for the remarkable team effort that made the first-ever WHL Forum in London an extraordinary success this week. The energy and dedication you poured into planning and executing this event from garnering 591 registrations, and securing inspiring speakers, thought-leaders in Dan Health, and customers from Sanofi and bp to localizing the event creative, sourcing local entertainers with the “Showstoppers”, and executing a seamless and flawless logistical plan — you were all truly exceptional.   Your passion, expertise, and collaborative spirit showed our mission and values on center stage! We created a perfect balance between knowledge-sharing and networking, leaving everyone feeling enriched and motivated - evident in how we captivated our audience and ignited their passion for creating a positive workplace culture (reinforced with our data) while allowing participants to actively engage, learn, and exchange ideas with their peers.    Your collective efforts helped support our annual business goals by creating an opportunity to engage with 72M in active pipeline across 15 opportunities, 27 customer accounts representing 280M in annual billings, 4 media interviews onsite, and 30 product demos with high-end brands like Rivian, Pearson, Lacoste, and Virgin Media. Beyond the numbers, we created a solid brand reputation in the market. You have all made a significant impact on the success of the Workhuman Live Forum, and I am grateful to have such an exceptional team by my side.   You should all feel really proud of what we accomplished this week! Thank you\n\n50#Harnessing Good Energy for bp!|Thank you to everyone who pitched in on the bp RFI that was just submitted today (1 minute before deadline!). There were a lot of tricky questions, but I venture Kevin Nealon would approve of the way we harnessed in the good energy and blocked out the bad (Harness. Energy. Block. Bad. Feel the flow. Feel it.) Thank you again!\n\n51#Amazing work to Support our largest Customers!|Wow, what a fantastic couple of days together!  SCDs, you showed up with dedication and fortitude to continue moving the ball forward at our largest customers.  There was a ton of creative thinking, partnering to support one another and focus on growth that we need to deliver, despite the challenges that are there in some instances.  The passion for striving to excellence is so apparent in your mindset at the work each of you are doing daily.  For those of you who joined us who are working alongside us to make the impossible possible, thank you!  Your partnership and determination to help deliver on the goals we all set together is beyond appreciated.  Each of you showed up, ready to listen, bring ideas to help support and grow our customers from each of your organizations.  The work we do together is so inspiring, and I can’t wait to see our hard work move the needle and celebrate together in our wins.  Cheers and thanks to each of you!\n\n52#Bloody brilliant teamwork|Hats off to this team for your persistence, thoughtfulness, and coordination to secure Nathalie Mackin from bp to join us as a speaker at Workhuman Live Forum in London!  It all began with Marie and Jose in offering up Nathalie! Thank you for your dedication to making bp successful with their program and creating such a strong relationship with Nathalie and the rest of the bp team so opportunities like this can happen in the first place. You both also raised the flag when we heard feedback about needing to streamline the speaker agreement in order to make this amenable to the bp team. On top of that, there's a completely new (read: more stringent) process to get speaking engagements approved by bp! Nathalie even said herself she wasn't sure if we could make it happen based on the circumstances! I also appreciate you keeping the momentum going while I was out on PTO - you have been invested in getting this speaking opportunity to happen since day 1.  Emily - thank you for hearing us out completely and taking quick action on revising the contract so that this could be a win-win for both us and the bp team!  Hillary - thank you for your guidance, explaining the legal language in \"plain English,\" taking an early call with me to run through it all to finalize the agreement on our side, and for helping us push this over the line to send an executed speaker agreement for counter-signature!   Amy and Kathryn - you do whatever it takes to make things possible and you make it FUN. I appreciate your determination, energy, flexibility, and passion. I'm inspired by working with the both of you. You make me want to be better and do more  Thank you ALL for your incredible team effort here! So fortunate I get to work with this group of varsity players.\n\n53#Wow Work for WHLive 2023!|Where to even start with the awesomeness this team brought to WHLive 2023!  You all inspired our largest customers to show up to WH Live in San Diego from across the globe (not just in the US, but from Europe and Asia).  Not only did they show up and advocate without question, but you also got them to speak, bring their teams and champion change at their organizations. I was beyond proud to see each of you hosting your customers with enthusiasm and spirit, helping them to understand the impact they can bring to their companies, laughing and building champions of Workhuman.  You played an integral part in creating the experience for them at Workhuman live.  I was pleased to see the partnership in helping to create experiences for those customers where colleagues couldn't be present.  I loved getting to hear first-hand from our largest customers about the partnerships you all have held for years in some cases and just a few months in other cases and how much it means to them as individuals and their organizations.  You all inspire me every day and the impact you're delivering to our customers makes all the difference.  Massive congratulations to all of you on a very successful WHLive 2023!\n\n54#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.  Your efforts created an unforgettable experience for over 1,500 attendees and reconfirmed our event as the world's leading HR conference.  Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.  From the quality of the keynote speakers and the thought-provoking sessions to all of the momentum and energy around sales and customer meetings, to each and every shift you each worked of demos, badge scanning, troubleshooting questions for attendees, and more you all played a pivotal role in ensuring our attendees had a positive experience, which has and will translate into increased brand loyalty, new pipeline creation, and customer retention. Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n55#Behind every great speaker...|...is an amazing announcer! To this group of amazing WHL breakout speaker announcers - a HUGE \"THANK YOU\" SHOUT OUT!  You were the hype-makers, the time-keepers, the \"stay calm & keep calm\" crowd controllers, and of course made our speakers shine! I personally want to thank you for being a vital part of the success of our breakout sessions this year. You not only showed up but you SHOWED UP! The rapport you each immediately built with each of your speakers was evident, and you reflected the energy in the rooms. I so appreciate your willingness and partnership in making sure everything ran smoothly. Kudos to all of you!\n\n56#Thank you for your partnership!|Marie, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for your invaluable support and connection with bp. Your requests on our behalf put us in a great place, and we remain determined to tell this customer's story in the most impactful way possible. Although things may not be turning out exactly as we had originally envisioned, I cannot express how thrilled I am that we are now building a strong, positive relationship with their communications team. This early win with such a prominent customer is nothing short of remarkable, and I believe it may be the surprise best-case scenario we never even considered. Thank you so much for your unwavering partnership and support throughout this journey!\n\n57#Overcoming a huge hurdle!|Team, just got off the Thermo call with all of you and I am SO inspired by what you all pulled off. This was an incredibly difficult and complex problem to solve with Thermo involving a ton of out of the box thinking, data collection & analyzing to get to a recommendation.  You captured it perfectly in the deck, delivered it with confidence and gained their agreement to consider a healthier path forward over their current program management practice. You inspired them with a strong impact analysis highlighting the importance of free flowing, recognition, created a case to move away from a practice of cancelling awards over 2 per month to an IPE structure, and presented other ideas to manage their investment and spread the impact further across their employee population. I don't know if my favorite part was hearing them say that they will consider moving some/all of the cash budget over to non-cash or that they were inspired by the discussion and look forward to partnering with us on this and other WHiQ studies involving performance and beyond. It's ALL amazing!!  Woohoo! Incredible planning, impeccable delivery and your work will undoubtedly lead to tangible results. Congrats to you all.\n\n58#Kicking off 2023 Right|Over the past month(s), all of you have been working diligently to build bold strategies to ensure we are best aligned to support our customers and have a solid plan for growth and increased investment.  This incredible group of humans showed up with brilliant ideas, a collaborative spirit and a passion that will no doubt bring success to Workhuman and our customers in 2023 and beyond.  It was two days’ worth of engaging dialog and commitment to find ways to move the needle, despite challenges and roadblocks that may be in our way.  We have solid plans to create even stronger relationships with Executives across our largest customers.  Next, a new renewals process to make our them even more impactful, engaging and successful. You also established a renewed sense of how to up level our Account Strategies to ensure we are always out front leading and bringing a proactive approach.  Our partnerships and alignment with our partners across WH are stronger than ever and I thank you all for leaning in as we are better together.  Cheers to each of you - a big thank you for bringing your best as it was so evident!\n\n59#Celebrating you all on Employee Appreciation Day!|I wanted to share with all of you how incredibly appreciative I am for all the work each of you do to support our largest customers here at Workhuman!  Leading the worlds biggest organizations to inspire and illuminate the good in their cultures is a massive responsibility and you all make it look effortless.  The varied strategies, passions and approaches you bring to the work you do is remarkable and so evident in the partnerships that you garner.  Thank you for your commitment to Workhuman and bringing the very best to our customers.  I hope that as we continue through 2023, you feel how valuable you are to me and the organization.  Cheers to each of you!\n\n60#Smooth Transitions|A huge thanks for this group of people for making these transitions so seamless. We've coordinated calls from Beijing, Los Angeles, Dublin, Boston, Portugal & Singapore, meeting clients day and night for introductions and handovers. Everyone of you has stepped up and taken on the additional workload and your dedication to ensuring our clients feel supported and heard is second to none. It's been such a pleasure to watch you all build these relationships, partnerships and friendships in such a short timeframe. Change comes with such a range of emotions but I've learnt from each of you and am so grateful for your support.\n\n61#Making a difference at Cisco|Marie, just incredible work this year on Cisco! On this week's business review, the Program Owner called out how important the program is to Cisco - both in terms of ROI and employee experience. They want to continue investing more into recognition and strive to not just meet best practices, but exceed them. We would not be in this incredible place with Cisco without your partnership on the account and the relationship you have built with the customer over the years. You continue to push internally for what is best for Cisco, pull in necessary stakeholders and really drive home the importance of Cisco's initiatives and what they are looking to accomplish. It's a tough account, but a fun one, and I appreciate all you do as we take this journey together. Well done my friend!\n\n62#Launching Annual reflections for bp|December 1, 2022, was the long-awaited day Workhuman would launch Annual reflections for bp. Proud to say, \"Mission accomplished!\" Over 37K bp employees now have access to Reflections. You participate in the remarkable group of humans behind bp's Annual reflection. We got the program across the finish line using effective communication, collaboration, transparency, and thought leadership. The goal we achieved in this program design is to display the power behind Conversations through Reflections and how companies can use a human-centric approach to performance reviews.    This launch started in June 2022. When I spoke with the PM Wednesday afternoon, she was thrilled and grateful for Workhuman's partnership throughout the implementation cycle. Thank you for being so dedicated to excellence.    Important note: the release of the Annual reflections is the second Reflections launch in a month. Well done, team!!!\n\n63#Excellence at Its Best!|I'm extremely proud of the determination you exemplified in our QBR session this week!  The profound dedication demonstrated across this team to outline and map how we can continue to deliver excellence to our customers was nothing short of incredible.  You all brought your biggest opportunities to the table to discuss how we can move them forward and identified what hurdles we need to overcome to bring them to fruition across the business.  I am always in awe to see how this group shows up for each other, helps to stretch each other’s thinking, helps to set a path towards achieving and exceeding what we need to deliver to our customers and to Workhuman.  Thank you all for your commitment to finish 2022 strong, while setting the bar high for 2023!\n\n64#Season of Giving Your All|This past week, all of you came together to share in the commitment to our customers, our company and each other!  It was so inspiring to see each and every one of you show up with passion and a desire to collectively learn from each other.  We spent time building momentum around how we unlock doors with executives, gaining full adoption of the Workhuman cloud, reaching new users on the platform, increasing investment and renewing our vows with longstanding customers.  The engagement that I saw when we discussed the roles everyone plays in supporting our customers, how you partner together and the achievements that have come from those partnerships was profound.  As we often hear, it takes a village - well I'm so PROUD to be a part of this village.  The commitment demonstrated in these sessions together is what makes us great and will continue to lead us into a bright 2023, no matter the challenges, we have each other!  In the spirit of the season of giving, thank you for giving it your all.  I look forward to more time together and a huge cheers to all of you!\n\n65#The story came together beautifully|Team, I listened to your Baker Hughes Account Review today and the STORY flowed so well from the start of the meeting until the end. The messaging was consistent, reinforced by data points, and showcased the PARTNERSHIP that we can provide via program features, ongoing comms, gratitude summits and MORE!  Status quo is not how we operate.....you challenged them to think differently, showed areas of opportunity and WHY they should partner with us to take action on these data points and opportunities. Each of you connected the dots perfectly for them and setup the next speaker's points so well. Great job team.\n\n66#So Grateful for all of You!|I can’t even begin to put into words how fortunate I feel to get to work with this incredibly talented group of amazing humans! You inspire me, our customers and all that have the privilege of working with you here at Workhuman. Your fierce determination and commitment to bringing the best to your roles everyday is unparalleled. You make my heart so full by being uniquely you and I am so lucky to have a front row seat to all you accomplish every single day! Cheers to you all!\n\n67#Setting the DIAMOND Standard @ Lam|Marie!! Marie!! Let's scream and shout your name! You have been instrumental in leading Lam to the promise land. Your leadership, expertise, accountability, constant guidance, and listening skills evoked this comment from Mary Beth Towne, VP of Total Rewards on our recent strategy and account review session. She said \"When we think of partners, Workhuman is the gold standard. You are tremendous partners to us.\" Then she paused and said \"No, the DIAMOND standard.\" That's high, high praise from a VP who use to work at Cisco and is now at Lam. I got goosebumps from her statement. It's a testament to your personal standards and how you align those with Workhuman standards! It's diamonds or go home!   All this while Lam is growing rapidly and moving from a 12,000+ workforce to over 18,000+ in less than a few years. No doubt, having you as a trusted advisor helps Mary Beth, Lark and others at Lam sleep at night. Their goals are mighty and require thoughtful, action-oriented, proven levers to reach the top. Thank you for providing the extended WH Customer Success team with guidance, focus and clarity on what was needed for the strategy and account review session in order for us all to add value, shine on the day and reinforce why Workhuman is the diamond standard. It's truly a joy to see you in action! YOU ROCK!!\n\n68#QBRzzzzzzz|This team has finally grown to the point that we’ve outpaced the Teams screen! It was wonderful to welcome Gardner and Janet in person! Thank you each for bringing your very thorough and thoughtful action plans along with ‘visual aids’ to share over the last 2 lonnnnng dayz! We focused on what you’ve identified for the final few months of 2022 and it was incredible to hear about your progress and your dream scenarios. Im always so impressed by the brain power that exists on the team and the level of ‘yes, and..’ that happens when we come together. Special shout out to Leslie, Rebecca, Abby, and the Goat, Traci P for bringing us thoughtful process and useful air cover and unique collateral to help us focus on Team Awards, Multiple Programs, and Renewals. Lets do this ‘Season of Giving’ the way we know how!\n\n69#Rocking Cisco like No Other!|Marie Ortiz!  Boy oh boy, when you set your mind to something, there is no stopping you!  I remember when you told me, \"I'm going to sell the whole cloud at Cisco\" and did you ever.  You took YOS away from two competitors, brought new programs onto Connected Recognition and got them to devote more budget to sending more recognition more often.  Just magical work her Marie and your dedication and fortitude are enviable.  It was beyond a pleasure to get to step in for a tiny bit to work with the Cisco team and see the trust and relationships you've built since taking on this customer.  It truly is a beacon of leadership, and I couldn't be more proud!  Incredible work and what a stunning achievement!  Way to go - Rock Star Status!\n\n70#Hang in there, You're doing AMAZING!|All, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the incredible work this team is doing everyday to support our largest customers!

It is a distinct privilege to get to see you in action, listen to your strategies to support our customers in all the right ways and see you succeed day after day.  It has been a rough go for a while now for a myriad of reasons and you all are absolute warriors.  You inspire and humble me with the creativity, fortitude and determination you all demonstrate.  Thank you for being uniquely you and for the contributions you bring to our customers and Workhuman.  Bravo!\n\n71#It takes a Workhuman village! (part 2)|Last week was the culmination of the efforts by so many to bring the Executive Forum to life at Workhuman Live. Joining the team only 6 weeks before the event, I was blown away by the work ethic, camaraderie, and creativity of everyone involved. Your support, encouragement, and tireless commitment to the finished product (both during the final stretch of planning and onsite) far exceeded anything I could have ever imagined in a team, and your efforts were instrumental in delivering an impactful program for ExF members. Thank you for bringing the vision to life. It was a sincere pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.  With the craziness of the event, I fell a bit behind with recognition in the final 2 weeks leading up to the event. Please know - your contributions did not go unnoticed.   SCDs and Sales Teams – for your diligent efforts to fill the room and empower the most important Customers and Prospects to join the conversation. These efforts not only contributed to the success of this event, they also helped lay the foundation for future events and further development of our business relationships.   Meghan, Chris W, and Dave – for your diligent work facilitating and tracking customer experience and the growth account participation. I appreciate your keen eyes on the process!   Corina and Dana – for your collaborative efforts in integrating the Partner Program elements into the ExF experience and for your timely action in helping to lock in details ahead of our internal deadlines. Also, for your leadership and companionship as co-hosts of the Bellyard breakfasts and enthusiasm throughout the onsite experience. Your input during the breakfast conversations added real value to the attendees’ experiences. It was a delight to watch you in action!  With tremendous thanks for your involvement and contribution to this process – congratulations on a job well done! Onward to Dublin!\n\n72#WHL Strategic Accounts Team Success|HOTLANTA! Well done to this team of fabulous people! We got to reunite with old friends, new friends, and each other! You worked tirelessly to get the right customers to attend and really engage with us and it really paid off. I was so proud watching you all connect with our customers and see how proud they were to be hosted by you! Each of the customer speaking sessions was FAB! Mike Malloy could hardly contain himself—he may want a fulltime gig! Even GE was beaming! So many customers from so many accounts—many first timers! You all worked your tails off to be sure every customer felt great about their experience and managed to unearth some new insights and opportunities! Well done to each of you and to this fantastic team. You show up for each other and for customers in the very best way…every time. Cheers!!\n\n73#Q1 QBRs: a Fresh New Year!|A 2 week-er! As we 'wrap up' QBRs for the first quarter of 2022, I want to thank you for your deep discovery work and preparation. We started with a week long deep dive account by account to get us all level set on our current footing. It was a very intense week and I so appreciate you all being so prepared and professional! We then gathered in my city by the Bay for another few days of collaboration, ideation, and BIG idea sharing. What a fantastic few days! Thank you for your commitment to this process, for showing up with your whole selves, for being supportive and encouraging of each other, and for making me laugh so much. I'm so proud of the work we're doing together and always SO happy to see you all in person. (I'm also super grateful that Erika's house is Covid-free! We missed your presence physically but we felt your presence virtually!) Safe travels home and happy weekend! #bestteamevah\n\n74#Focus at bp!|Marie, a HUGE CONGRATULATIONS on Conversations going live to over 36K employees at bp yesterday!  You have led the charge and worked tirelessly for a long time to bring this to fruition.  You have made it your personal mission to bring the WH Cloud to all of your customers and getting bp to launch conversations was no easy feat, but yet in your normal fashion, you made it look simple.  You have such a talent to bring everything together for a customer and help them to see things as they should.  They walk away seeing, believing and feeling like a million bucks thanks to your special touch.  I know this is yet another challenged crushed for you and I am beyond proud of the leadership you bestowed.  Way to go!\n\n75#The BEST team on the Planet!|You all are a team of fierce, focused and determined humans!  I am so thankful to have a front row seat to watch you pouring your heart into all that you do to support our customers and grow the business for Workhuman.  Each of you inspires me beyond measure.  The work you all do everyday is challenging and hard and you make it look effortless.  You are truly moving mountains and I couldn't be more proud of you all.

With the change in program ownership on Thermo's side, it was clear we needed to get the core team together for a strategy session and ensure they see the ROI in the program.

I see you!\n\n108#Putting your heart into it|Thank you all for your contributions to Edwards Lifescience 2020 annual review for their HEART program. It is always nice when a client call is filled with connections on a personal level and that was the case with our Edwards program team.  We spent the first 10 minutes of the call laughing! That is a testament to the relationships you have built with the Edwards team over the years. Joyce, your thoughtfulness was shown right from the start by highlighting it was the program manager's birthday and you created a slide full of her favorite bitmoji's to celebrate! Marie, you did a great job in having Edwards confirm what their priorities are for this year and it lead to a meaningful conversation around program recommendations.

All of your skills have been put to the test~ negotiating pricing, negotiating procurement people out to make their 'first' mark in the world, getting the entire cloud of adopted by bp, and recruiting the executive team to the WH fan club! Without a doubt, quite a remarkable game of 'catch this knife'! Not only do you finish up completely unscathed, but you literally knocked this one way over those clouds! Execs from the CEO to the 'new' CHRO, to your champion SVP of Rewards and on down the line, you have built an incredibly solid pipeline of WH club memberships! In one of the toughest years in bp's new strategy, you've managed to sell our first full WH suite with up front fees to one of our biggest customers. What a journey!

As we 'close' out this year, you've once again dug deep and positioned us for more growth in 2021 though insightful planning and visionary thinking.

Wishing each of you a day of rest and some time to reflect on your achievements thus far. I continue to be inspired by you and by the possibilities you see in yourselves and each other!\n\n114#Moonshots and scaling for growth|Thank you for bringing your whole selves - passion, creativity, focus, personality and intelligence - to our series of customer growth offsites.  Starting with moonshot thinking and doing the impossible  (the way appears as you start on the way), through investment prioritization and ending with business scaling initiatives, these past three sessions have uncovered many great ideas and plans. To gain this type of alignment and progress requires everyone to participate actively and to do so in the spirit of inter-dependence and collaboration.  You all definitely delivered on that and it sets us up well for 2021.  I'm proud to be alongside you on this journey.  Onward and upward!\n\n115#Warm introduction at M&T Bank|Marie,  Alex Paz and myself wanted to thank you for connecting us with Bob Tolan VP. We had a call with him today and he gave us some great information and is willing to help get us connected with some key contacts.  Thank you so much for your willingness to help!\n\n116#Pioneering efforts|Eileen, Marie, Paul and Patrick, thank you for your outstanding efforts in securing the first three Workhuman Certified Pioneers!  Securing executive level sponsorship for a brand new, provocative and industry changing initiative like this is not for the faint-hearted.  It requires creativity, persistence and courage to paint a vision for these leaders of what could be.  And you all came through!  The customer videos from Schneider, Cisco and Baystate were so powerful and a critical validation of our efforts to create a more human workplace.  Your contributions made this launch possible.  Thank you and fantastic work!\n\n117#Doing the dirty work|Let's face it, data clean up is no fun.  But, it's worth it!  Thank you for taking time out of your insane schedules to comb through data, find missing pieces and populate our tracker.  Becasue of your efforts we'll be able to get this into a centralized place - allowing us to work smarter and faster from here on out.  Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and getting it done!\n\n118#What a Team, What a Q3!|Biggest of shout outs to this team of strategic thinkers and leaders! After a much needed 4th of July breather, this team came roaring back and starting blasting moonshots right out of the gate...securing meetings with some of our biggest customers to recruit them to be early adopters of our next gen DEI functionality, recruiting Pioneers for the WHCE, leading SO MANY strategic customer reviews with senior leaders, and killing it with multiple major deals! A team of super heroes! So proud of the work that you're doing and WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER QUARTER TO GO!\n\n119#That’s a Wrap (with the prep, at least)|Derek, Brenda, Marie, and Patrick, thank you for your time and energy today as we completed our customer prep calls for Workhuman Live Online. Whether you were on one or both of these calls today, you each played an essential role on bringing Workhuman Certified to life for this engagement. To hear the CHRO of Cisco say she’s excited about both opportunities and feels perfectly prepared to help lead the conversation is a tremendous compliment. We also had an impactful conversation with the CHRO of Baystate Health to understand all that they want to accomplish on behalf of their employees. Now the countdown is on to bring these stories to life.\n\n120#Setting up camp on the Moon|The biggest of shout outs to this group of badass teammates! Talk about taking Moonshots! Each of you came together to influence directly, support, and create an lane for us to present the WHCE movement directly to the most senior executives at some of our most influential customers. While we have certainly had opening in the enterprise communications groups at customers over the years, I believe this opportunity/offer to amplify their employee brand with Workhuman is being met in a very different way in 2020. The reactions at Board level executives is 'absolutely!'. While some of their calendars could not support the October timeframe, I believe they will be clamoring to participate in on-going events. We're going to have to start reading up on Beyond the Moon Shots! We have created incredible relationships with Executive Communications leaders through this process...relationships that will make us unstoppable. Thank you for your collaboration, support, all-in attitudes, and LEADERSHIP! To the Moon and Beyond!\n\n121#Thermo and Icon back in business!|Congratulations and thank you for your continued work over these last months to get these two customers to turn their recognition programs back on. I know that's it's been a lively 2020 with many ups and downs. Having a customer suspend a program after so much progress and momentum has been built over years of hard work has been really tough especially on you closest to the customers. Thank you for staying true to the WH Way and for motivating, coaxing, and cheering these two important customers to get back into the recognition business. Their employees are benefiting from your hard work and commitment. Bravo!\n\n122#Building Momentum|Thanks to this team for your time today discussing certified customer stories for Workhuman Live Online. Sometimes it takes an hour or two of good old-fashioned brainstorming to assess where we’re at in the process, identify the key leaders we want involved, and talk through any potential challenges. A special shout out to Eileen, Marie, and Paul for providing additional insight into each of your respective certified customers. Your expertise on collaborating with these accounts is priceless. While it will take a small village to get this over the finish line, there’s no better group of humans positioned to do it. Thanks to everyone for taking on the challenge so we can create something really exceptional alongside our customers.\n\n123#The Two Day ZoomBR Bonfire!|Thanks to this amazing team for two days (well, half days) of inspired thinking and planning in preparation for an amazing 2nd Half! As much as we missed the personal interaction and late nights, we managed to reconnect in a way that we really haven't been able to pull off in a few months! Special shout out to our Queen, Traci Pesch! She really knows how to inspire, engage, and fan the flames of success! Between Traci and Rebecca's creative minds we've got a great plan to find s'more ways to connect and create incredible experiences for our customers! And, looky here, we've got ourselves a marketing team! Thanks ever so much to the gods who sent us our fierce team in customer marketing, represented with the incredible Kristen G! A thoughtful, workable plan to bring our friends into the many cool streams happening in marketing. And lastly, thanks to all of you badass SCDs, always bringing the big ideas, shaking things up, pushing beyond your comfort zones and helping our customers do the same! I'm humbled and impressed every day to get to work with such a powerful group of people who do nothing but cheer each other on! Let's go light this thing up!\n\n124#Thank you bp!|A huge THANK YOU to this team for creating a video moment that is sure to touch the hearts of those at bp receiving it. This was a true team effort with lots of moving parts, but it was all worth it because the final product is incredible! Marie, thank you for having the idea to share a moment of thanks with our friends at bp and for not recording your message once, but twice to make sure it was the right tone and message for them. Derek, thank you for jumping in and creating a sentimental clip for bp, I am so thankful to have your lovely presence and demeanor in this special video. Owen, you are an all-star writer and since working on this project with you, I would call you a visionary! Your style and effort on this project has made the difference between an OK video, and a great one. This one is GREAT! Kristen, thanks for taking this a step further to create a lovely vehicle to get this video to bp from Marie, and for sharing your strategic thoughts through this process. Oh, and for suggesting a video vendor so I didn't have to learn the entire skill of making a video myself! :) Christina, thank you for managing this project and the workload of the team members to ensure we got the work done, and done right! We are certainly getting into a nice groove working together so often! Kylie, thank you for being a part of this and for making sure we had the perfect video clip to include that meshed with the rest of the video, even though you ended up recording your part twice! Lynette, thank you for being so flexible and getting the clip to me through several channels, and for recording it twice to make sure it meshed well in the video, RIGHT when you got back from your vacation!! This team deserves a huge round of applause for this project, and I can't wait to see this be a spring board for additional partnership with bp in so many areas! THANK YOU!\n\n125#Wow|Team, I was reviewing all of your progress updates for top accounts early this morning and I have to say that the work this team is doing is fantastic.  So many different variables are involved in these huge, complex accounts but each of you is on top of your accounts in such a strategic way.  Whether it is new growth in thriving accounts like bulk uploads, new sales incentive programs and retirement/milestone awards or just the right amount of surrounding for those accounts in temporary suspension.  This \"in the trenches\" work is so critical to the health and growth of both our business and the lives of the employees at your customers.  They need it more than ever right now.  Bravo and well done!  And special call out to your fearless leader Eileen who is leading from the front with a huge dose of imagination and determination.  Happy Monday!\n\n126#Dream Team|I just want to take this moment to pay homage to this team of fierce, talented leaders for their focus and resilience during what is sure to go down in history as one of the most stressful times in world history. It's been quite an experience for each of us during this pandemic both from the work perspective and the 'outside of work' perspective. Each of you has been laser focused on the opportunity this situation created for our business and each of you have created opportunities out of this situation for the business! I'm so humbled by the never-quit mentality that you have lead with and continue to lead with in this environment. The impact you have made on our business at this moment is astounding. Thank you for the sacrifices, determination, support for each other, humor, and grace you have shown these past few months. It's pure joy to work with you!\n\n127#BP Case Study---Energize the Market|Through the very active customer leadership of Marie through what has been an unprecedented period in the history of BP--- a reorganization of their entire Exec team, an major industry downturn, and a global pandemic (which hit Marie very close to home)---we are sending an incredible story of positivity out into the universe today! You have delicately and diligently stayed after our friends at BP encouraging them to get approvals and actually BOOST this project with direct quotes, etc. As if prioritizing the publishing of a case study would even be on their short list! Incredible work---master level relationship management. Even better, you got to work with our super talented friend Sarah to draft what has turned into a beautiful piece of work that will live on for many years. Sarah, we are so grateful to shine a bright light on your talent. Thank you so much for your partnership and patience! Congrats to you both and thank you for hanging in there with great confidence that OF COURSE BP will want to publish this NOW! Well done!!!\n\n128#CREATING A WAVE of GRATITUDE|Can you feel it? It's a soul lifting, soaking you to the bone, crashing wave of gratitude and joy that is emanating from this group of people. There are SO many ways this team of people is banding together, ideating, taking action, sharing, and LIFTING our customers (and each other) in this incredible hectic time! I just want to take a moment to say thank you for working through this time of uncertainty with your hearts on your sleeve. For reaching out to customers and giving them strength and light and the power to do good. If there was ever a team meant for the right now, it's this team. Thank you from leading from each of your seats and for creating incredible opportunities on a daily basis for our customers, for our brand, and for our business! You're ALL HEART and I'm loving it!!!\n\n129#Workhuman Wanderers|Congrats team, we did it! We completed our Amazing Architecture Virgin Pulse challenge in record time. Not only did we finish, but we came in 77 out of 940 active teams! That's amazing!!! Recognizing everyone's efforts to complete the challenge by staying active, especially during these times felt important. I appreciate all of you and was genuinely impressed - Marie and Liz, you two can run like the wind with around 400k steps a piece... WOW. Stay safe & stay active, friends!\n\n130#Full Speed Ahead|#weworkhuman #shootthemoon #theinstitute  What a revitalizing day and a half! Thank you to this team of great big thinkers and risk takers for a deeply challenging few days of daring to reach for BIG ideas and creative paths to accomplish our mission. It was a great way to kick off our “project” for 2020. I believe this team, in this partnership, can achieve new heights. Thank you for giving yourself to this with your whole self! Cheers to the Dream State! Special shouts to Becky, Traci, and Jill for helping nail down our process and making sure we paused to drink and eat!!!\n\n131#Team 9 Solutions Breakout!|Team, thank you all so much for your time, energy and innovation at Ignite this week! It was exciting to discuss the end-user experience and how we can capture feedback and build advocacy. Everyone brought great and creative solutions to the table and I'm excited to share back all the notes to our Exec Sponsors! For the record, I did type them up so no one else has to endure my chicken-scratch! A special shout out to Alison for being our scribe and putting our thoughts down so cohesively and in a much more visually appealing way and a huge thanks to Erica, John and Noah for the excellent presentation on behalf of the team. It was a great conversation and I'm excited to see what comes next! Thank you all!\n\n132#Keepin' it Legal during the dine around|Thanks to all of you for being great company at Legal Seafood's!  I really enjoyed getting to know each of you a bit better, as well as hearing some great stories about your unique lives and Workhuman's past.  From stories about marathons in far-off lands, adventures in New York city, the sights and sounds of India, the wild hills of Pennsylvania, safaris in South Africa - this is a well-traveled bunch!  You are all amazing humans - thank you!\n\n133#Mastering Conversations at Mastercard|Thank you for an amazing Conversations Design Lab experience at Mastercard. We've evolved our product significantly in the last year requiring us to also significantly evolve Convo Design Lab to cast a vision, inspire, set a strategy and design for productive use. Marie - you worked closely in partnership with the client to not just get a contract, but to inspire them (over the course of many months) to see the possibilities of Conversations in their business. Danielle - you've been the heart and soul of the Mastercard relationship for the last 2 years, laying a solid foundation for us to continue to build and expand the WH Cloud in this important customer. You also played a critical role in the Design Lab to lay the groundwork for how we can functionally deliver this pilot in a way that delivers the data and reporting to prove success. Julie - you spent a good deal of time and brain power to redesign and redevelop the facilitation deck we use in the session. Then, during the session, you hung on all day remotely, chiming in with your wisdom and detailed product knowledge to keep us on track and in line. Lisa - you helped bring the deck to final and then took on the responsibility of facilitating the Design portion of the session, masterfully guiding the client through thinking more deeply about their underlying needs and how they would play out in Conversations to help their employees accomplish what they're already doing faster, easier and more efficiently and effectively. Grant - you booked flights at the last second to join us as exec sponsor, lend your wisdom and insights, and draw on your prior relationship with a driving member of the client project team. Your contributions during the session both helped broaden the client's thinking and tightened the focus for a successful pilot. I'm excited about where we can take this client in achieving their goals while also furthering our own goals with Conversations - none of which would be possible without all of you\n\n134#Putting the endurance training to the test :)|Marie, a well overdue thank you for all of your support this year on BP. It’s been a pleasure to work with and learn from you as this relationship develops & grows. I am so grateful for how you have prioritised and kept us both accountable for our weekly catch ups, no matter where we are in the world, to ensure we are both aligned on the many moving parts. It never ceases to be an amusing highlight to my week as we share insight! Thank you for joining very early morning calls, escalating internally to prioritise ecommerce needs, leading an ever changing WARI project and everything in between. You are always keeping us focused on what's most important. Even after securing a very healthy budget for 2019, you were on the first plane out to get ahead of this for 2020. I have no doubt we'll be kept on our toes next year...i'll be buying some running shoes to try to keep up! Thank You!\n\n135#Cost justification needed ASAP|Marie, when our shared strategic customer asked for a cost justification turned around within 24 hours! We had some information from August, but they wanted some updates as well as some information on belonging, engagement etc. That part is readily available, but you immediately stepped up to get some updated program data (via WARI) to the customer. You also did your due diligence by reaching out to the program sponsor to find out more about why this was being requested...information that the program manager wasn't sharing with us. Thank you for dropping everything, jumping in feet first and reaching out to WARI to get the ball rolling and turned around sooooo quickly. I really appreciate your teamwork and sense of urgency.\n\n136#Accelerating into 2020|What a year of surprises! Thanks to each of you for bringing your insights, ideas, and energy to bear on our top 5 accounts. We've been meeting quarterly to review from every angle how we can from every perspective, impact the business. So many great ideas were uncovered and put into action immediately from these conversations. And each of us, learned something big about how with some focus, we could more directly impact big opportunities as an organization. Thank you for early and late meetings, for staying focused, and for caring so much about excellence! This has been an incredible 'test' of the WH network! Bravo!\n\n137#Q4 QBRs Rocked!|Thanks to every person on this team for bringing your best selves to Cleveland in the middle of a flurry of major projects, meetings, deliverables, and personal commitments. Each of you came together to share some incredible best practices, strategies that have moved the needles with our biggest opportunities, and some big plans for 2020. There is no better group of people to spend 2.5 days with talking about work. You bring a passion to the business that is only matched by Traci's passion for Cleveland! Thank you for your commitment to excellence! You ROCK!\n\n138#Mastercard at Evanta|Thanks to each of you for helping to bring the Mastercard story to life at Evanta. Traci, you filled me in on the backstory - why they moved forward with a recognition program, initial goals, and insights around their communication/launch strategy. Danielle, you provided program metrics for another speaking engagement that came in handy for this one! Marie, you filled me in on the progress they’ve made since launch, along with the current work they’re doing in partnership with us. The slides you pulled together were a great demonstration of the insights you can get from a robust recognition program. Jesse, you were flexible as always to make adjustments and provide the context that aligned with Mastercard’s journey. This opportunity came together so quickly, and we never would have been able to do this customer story justice without your support, quick turnaround, and valuable insight. I'm grateful for colleagues I can count on. Thank you!\n\n139#Another great customer Case Study in the works!|Kylie and Marie, so excited to see the incredible relationship with BP cemented over the last year of painstaking work by both of you! Delighted to hear that Susan has agreed to memorialize their success in a case study with us. It takes a lot to bring a customer of any size to the table in true partnership but it takes master level skills to bring a company as complex and at the pure scale as BP. Super excited to see this come to fruition! Well done!!!\n\n140#Cisco success!|Marie, thanks for all your amazing work in organizing the Cisco business review last week. It’s hard to believe this is the first time Workhuman has ever been able to get on site with this client, but it certainly made a difference. At the end of the meeting Cisco commented on how important they felt the meeting had been, as we covered so many important topics and have so many amazing ideas to move the program forward. You’ve developed an incredible relationship with Gaby and certainly earned her trust and respect, which is opening many doors for Workhuman. It’s been great working with you so far as I get up-to-speed on all things Cisco, and I look forward to what the future brings!\n\n141#Bay Area Women in HR Event Success|So well done kicking off what I hope will be a series of WH hosted 'Women in HR' events in our local customer hubs! We had such a great night with some incredibly talented women. Lots of great feedback on bringing this community together and lots of energy for repeating this type of event and building community amongst HR leaders. Thank you for standing this event up quickly with very few resources and knocking it out of the park! Bravo!\n\n142#Strategic Relationship with BP - 8% of Payroll !?!|I want to congratulate you on fostering such a strong relationship with one of our newest and most important clients, BP.  One of their most senior HR executives reached out to you and requested a meeting with us to discuss some veryInnovative approaches to recognition.  He wants to move from a 1% program to possibly an 8% of payroll program by moving all spot bonuses into the recognition program.  Over dinner in New York City, we were able to discuss with him how we can help in that transition and how it highly aligns to our overall company strategy and messaging.  We have a long way to go on that initiative with him but you have the whole Workhuman team's support to make it happen!  Great job!\n\n143#Customer Commuting in SoCal|Corbrina and Marie, thank you for spending the better part of a week committed to some customer face time at the global Evanta CHRO summit in/near/outside of Westlake Village. Turns out it’s not Los Angeles! You made the absolute most of this event, making incredible impact with customers in attendance and what are certain to be customers in the future. No coincidence that two of your customers brought the house down to wrap up the three days! Incredible testimonials and great reflections of your relationships. I also really appreciate you spending an additional day to spend planning for our future. Thank you for what I know has been an incredibly long week. Really appreciate your commitment! You’re awesome!\n\n144#Fighting through at Mastercard|Marie, congratulations on closing an incredibly challenging renewal with Mastercard. You have literally had to fight through a lot of crazy to get us to this point but have done so quite patiently and successfully. I'm excited about all of the possibilities that you are unlocking. Well done closing this one out and continuing the good fight!\n\n145#Q3 Acceleration|Thanks to this team for another outstanding Acceleration Project quarterly mind meld. Every quarter we come together representing the expertise and perspective of many areas of the business. This quarter was special as we've 'accelerated' our thinking and really got the team thinking bigger and making connections and recommendations. This commitment and intense work for our top 5 customers is paying off as we have come away with a laundry list of opportunities and ideas to grow and protect the business. Thank you for your teamwork, intense listening skills, and outstanding impactful insights!!!\n\n146#The Percussion Section is on FIRE|Thanks to each of you for bringing your 'best beats' to Bootcamp! Every great band needs a percussion section that can offer confidence, a solid framework, and some sick solos. Each of you came to play in Newport! Thank you for sharing your success with our most significant customers, your confidence in our market leadership, and your learnings along the way. Not only did you share with the broader sales organization but also in our team meetings throughout the week.  It's always tough to get through our QBR session, even when we have twice the time, so this time was especially impactful as you shared your work and opportunities. Especially thankful for our teammates who are bringing the pain with some incredible marketing ideas and experience projects that should elevate our ability to play into our Mick Jagger years! Cheers!\n\n147#Orchestrating 'Easy' at Cisco|Marie, I am simply in awe of the work that you have done with Cisco in the short amount of time you have been leading the effort. You have managed to take all of the 'outstanding issues and requests' off the table, get them to admit that they are the hold up on nearly all of the 'asks', keep Gaby T excited about the future and impact that recognition is having at Cisco, AND get a 3 year renewal signed in record time. I think you might consider 'leveling up' from marathons to Super Tough Mudders or American Ninja Warriors because you have the ability to ORCHESTRATE multiple disciplines, experts, projects, and fast moving trains like nobody's business. Congratulations on a record renewal in the midst of what seemed like a tornado of roadblocks.  YOU ROCK!\n\n148#Inspiring Greatness|Thank you to this incredible team of strategists for an impressive two (very) long days of concentrated best practice sharing, ideation, mind blowing progress on our dream state goals, and overall pure stamina. I was reminded again these last solid 48 hours exactly how much work you are doing and magic you are making at our most strategic customers. It is truly mind blowing what we can do as a team to impact the business. Thank you for your teamwork, your commitment to make the best of our time together, for helping to find the humor in some tough situations, and for being downright badass leaders. Each of you brought a perspective to our two day marathon that helped someone move an idea or a strategy forward. Each of you contributed your unique voice. Together, you make up the greatest team I’ve been privileged to work with. Onward to victory! Bravo!\n\n149#Mastercard A Team|I wanted to thank you all for playing a key role in making yesterday's meeting with Mastercard a success! Alan- you did such an amazing job pulling together all of the data, and more importantly, were such a trooper for getting those last few data points that I requested last minute. Greg- you played such an instrumental role in our meeting  (as you always do!). You did a phenomenal job presenting who WARI is, what we can do from a partnership perspective and finally some of their own results. You definitely got the new VP's attention, and I do believe he will help us get connected to their analytics team as a next step! Marie- you did a great job kicking us off and helping Nilesh understand all of our capabilities. It is clear that you built a great relationship with Rosanne over these last few months!  Last but not least, thank you Meghan for joining me on my first account review back from maternity leave. You shared some great ideas/examples of what other clients have done, that could result in new business opportunities. Thanks again team, look forward to continuing our great conversations with Mastercard over the next few weeks!\n\n150#Woman on Fire!|Marie-- a big shout out on your juggling of the MANY balls in the virtual air at Cisco! You thought re-entry from your delightful marathon-running trip to France was going to be bumpy....Universe's answer: \"hold my beer\". There is so much amazing stuff happening with our friends at Cisco, and it falls to you to align all of that work and progress, package it up, share it in an influential way and at the right time, to the right people and get our renewal wrapped up.  To a lesser person, this would be a tough mountain to climb. In the course of a week, you not only influenced the acceleration of our renewal, but now you've re-recruited Claire Gray to the cause. To have a VP say to you that she's going to clear the roads internally and manage the nonsense out, is the kind of champion one only dreams to be! If that weren't enough, you managed to herd our team to a call with Gaby Thompson, against the odds and the scheduling Gods, and got her to say \"she's excited about the momentum that she's been looking for\" from us. I know it can be difficult to take on an account where so many of us Humans are involved/committed/entangled/'helping'...I just want you to know that you are doing a Masterful job! You're SO on FIRE!\n\n151#\"Appreciate\"-ing You|Team, thank you all for the blood, sweat and tears you put into planning and executing the Thermo Fisher Appreciate account review. I don't think I've ever started planning so early for a client, only to have to rethink and revise our presentation multiple times as the date changed, audience changed, content requested changed, and more. We were thrilled to hear that the compensation leaders were going to be in town the week of our review and how amazing that they invited us to present to the executive team. You all spent endless hours determining exactly what this team needs to hear, and ensuring we did not come off as \"salesy\" in any way (Steve's words!). The data and insights provided were extremely well-received by the leadership team, and the audience was engaged and interactive. The recommendations for future projects and communication plans were readily accepted and our PM even suggested we make this an annual event to present to the leadership team. Thank you all for your amazing team work and in ensuring our partnership with Thermo Fisher continues to thrive.\n\n152#So.Dope.|Strategic Client Director/Badass Story Tellers/Moment Creators/Momentum Shifters---this week has been one for the ages. We set a goal to drive up attendance for WH19 with specific emphasis on executives that have voting power and influence on real change at our most strategic accounts. Not only did you all (y'all) slay those numbers but you dug in, got super focused, and created specific moments for each of those accounts to really experience what this WH movement is all about. Not a second went by at this 5 day shindig where you weren't all communicating, supporting, connecting, and engaging with some of the most influential people in Nashville. I could not be prouder of the master class level preparation and execution of your plans, the quality of the conversations had, the next level situational awareness and lightening speed with which you moved on openings, and the absolute delight I witnessed and heard directly from your clients. We thought we kicked off this year thinking about the Dream State but I believe we've just scratched the surface. Get some rest, sheroes, your limits just opened up again!\n\n153#It's not over till it's Nashville|Marie, I am impressed every day by your ability to move people out of their seats! Here we are getting into the final hours to influence customers to get up and spend a week in Nashville and you manage to get the entire HRLT from Edwards to say \"YeeHaw!\"! Not just attendees, but the RIGHT attendees!  So impressive and so you! Thank you for continuing to push the gas and run full speed through the finish line.  Bravo!\n\n154#Acceleration Kickoff Team|A big thank you and much gratitude to the entire team involved in kicking off our global internal 'review' of our top 5 customers! It took many hours of prep to do the research, thinking, and reporting for each of your areas of expertise AND then several more hours to come together as a team and review all of the great insights.  Thank you for digging in, thinking BIG, and committing yourselves to this important effort. One more review meeting to go! With every call we've made some connections, identified some opportunities, and put ourselves in a better place strategically.  Great work!\n\n155#Fast, Accurate, Inspiring Hands|For all of you lasered focused on all of the varied communications going out to our customers, THANK YOU! It's a race to Nashville and I am SO happy to have you all on our team! Lots of details and first impressions to be made and you are all making every effort to knock them out of the park.  YOU ROCK!\n\n156#Dream State|Excellent work preparing thoughtful action plans that map our work toward the dream state with all of our strategic customers. What an excellent QBR session! I challenged you all to think big and you blew me away. It’s hard to believe how much we discussed, developed, and dreamt up in just one day! It was possible because you all put the work in ahead of time. Having Rebecca and Traci join us and start to immediately aligning with our work was the icing on our Valentine cake! Well done all! Really proud to work with each of you!\n\n157#Social Selling Star!|Great job being called out as the \"Winners of the Week\" during this Monday's session of Social Selling Training. Your module assignment completion set a great example for the team. Thanks for your enthusiastic participation in this initiative!\n\n158#Filling the room and supporting the event|Chris, Alex, Dave, Tim, Vahagn, Marie and Sheri - Thank you for all your help in driving attendance and supporting the SPARK event at Ferring the other evening. We had close to 70 attendees from customers and prospects alike! The event could not have been as successful without your support of my efforts. This is what it's all about, TEAMWORK. If you had a prospect there I hope this helps move your deal along and if you had a customer there I hope this allows you to get closer to them. Cheers!\n\n159#BP & Globoforce - Always energized!!!|Thank You for all your amazing efforts in helping us deliver another great meeting between one of our favourite customers - BP. With each meeting we have with BP, I do see our relationship getting stronger and stronger. From the lovely dinner we had with the team the night before where we deepened both personal and business connections to the two breakout meetings we had the next day. Having these strong personal connections with our customers make business so much easier! You can tell they like us as they are so enthusiastic to work with us and are always happy to take the next challenge in making energize! even more successful than it already is, (where a recognition moment is occurring every 4 secs!!!) As usual you all played a key part in your role and made the customer feel so valued! The discussions we had were rich and rewarding, from reviewing their SLA targets that are being achieved to allowing us to show some of their results through our WHARI lens. This meeting allowed us to be introduced to new Executives too such as Gary Hibbard, Head of Benefits and HR M&A who is essentially the person in charge of all service anniversaries for BP and who will be a critical for us to work with as we look to having more countries rollout YOS in 2019. The second key Executive connection to blossom from this meeting, Paul Twohy, Group CFO Communications Manager as he is looking in 2019 to use Globoforce platform to help with their prestigious Helios awards – a CEO sponsored programme that celebrates BP’s achievements and drives learning across the business.  These connections alone are great to have and to have it as part of our review with them is even better!! Thank you for making this a great meeting!\n\n160#Q4 Full Court Press|Shouting it out to the hardest working team in the league!  These past few months each and every person on this team has proven to be RELENTLESS about driving opportunities forward, boxing out our competitors, proactively shutting down potential threats to our business, and inspiring our largest customers to invest more in their WorkHuman cultures.  Bravo to all of you fighters!  Thank you for digging deep and reaching for the stars!\n\n161#Transforming Transamerica!|Marie, enormous thank you for helping to make our Transamerica account review such a success! You came on board just a couple months ago & immediately dug in with me to understand the program, people & relationships, pain points and opportunities. You took time to review the deck, talk strategy & goals & started reaching out to the CHRO to get that always important buy in. While Julie had a conflict & wasnt able to attend, you engaged & her EA excitedly responded - giving us an in and giving our PM a foot in the door at that level! You were fantastic during the review; covering the importance of exec support, a properly funded program, WARI & WH Cloud. This was the most open & conversational acct review I've been part of; our PM truly understands recognition & is excited about our new tasks & goals. Those along with engaging those higher ups, are really going to help move the needle with getting them to monetary recognition at a global level. On a personal note, I had a blast with you and cant wait for our next trip, hopefully to the Hague where you can fit in a marathon! I'm so lucky to have you on my team Marie, thank you!\n\n162#These Are the Days|An incredible two days this week. We use this term QBR pretty loosely. We might have to think of a more realistic name like Quarterly Intensive Strategy and Physical Survival Challenge. Thank goodness we added a word class marathon runner to the team...In all seriousness, given the multitude of current active projects and opportunities, thank you each for so diligently preparing and delivering your portfolio reviews. It can be so tough to take your foot off the pedal and step back and dedicate time to big picture strategy and ideation but we all know how critical it is to our growth as individuals and to the growth of the business. Bravo on another excellent 2 day (!) session. Thank you for bringing your whole selves to these two days and holding your concentration for such an intensely long period!\n\n163#Off to the races!|Marie, congratulations on your “Customer Success” certification. Our side of the field is a bit of a change from sales but I think your having that experience is putting you in an excellent position for success! (I bet you didn’t expect to learn as much as you have learned in the last weeks! ) You’ve done an excellent job digging into the details and meeting with all of our strategic partners behind the scenes. I have every confidence that you are going to wow our customers! Well done! Let’s do this!!\n\n164#Starbucks Microsite|I'm not even sure how to word just how amazing the Starbucks video and Microsite came out. The video is perfect. The messaging is spot on, the videography is beautifully done, Steve's presence is felt from beginning to end, and I have personally been showing everyone I know because this is easily the coolest way I have ever attempted to build a relationship with a prospect. I am positive something good will come from this and I can't wait to share the good news. Hats off to all of you!\n\n165#eBay meeting!|Marie, Hari and Rosette-   GREAT PRESENTATION!!!!! Congratulations on a successful meeting at eBay!  Excellent job presenting the WH cloud and importance of a R & R foundation with Conversations added!  Excellent job presenting a unified program and speaking to each stakeholders individual needs!!  Nice work preparing for the meeting, your attention to detail is commendable!!  Great job Stephen- you have been a constant with eBay-and helping guide this opportunity through the sales cycle!  Great work- let's get this one!!!!!\n\n166#Evanta Seattle- \"Working the Room\"|Huge shout our for all of the great networking at Evanta Seattle! Each of you took ownership entrenching yourself in the event.  Nice work taking a leadership role during break-out sessions, evening event/ dinner, breakfast and lunch.  Excellent work leading your table conversations around WH, Recognition and Conversations.  Although the event was \"networking - not selling\" you all did an excellent job weaving in Globoforce and the WH Cloud!!!  Well done! Hari- Nice work leading your break-out session!!! The feedback at the booth on your session was very positive (of course!) Krista-  As always, your marketing support was once again amazing (logistics, attendee lists, booth set up, working with the Evanta team, etc. ) -  you nailed it!!!!  Great work and well done!!!\n\n167#What a night!|I can not put into words how great everyone was at the dinner with eBay/Stub Hub. From the moment they entered the room the conversations and engagement level was incredible. With the 4 of us sitting strategically we were able to have micro conversations and create more personal relationships. On my way to lunch leaving the conference I bumped into Lacey, Christine, and Mazzy and they were swept off their feet!\n\n168#2nd Place:  Opportunities NOT Reg for WH Contest|Marie and Stephen, Congratulations on the phenomenal job you did as a team driving attendees that are at accounts that we have active opportunities but were not registered for WorkHuman. You were able to send 6 more Registrants from these important accounts and that great effort will yield great results!\n\n169#Great Place to Work Gratitude|Thank you so much for everything you brought to the table last week at Great Place to Work!!! We were in a tough area for traffic but you shined the light on the Gratitude Bar once people heard about Globoforce and all the great work we were bringing to the conference! You all did a great job explaining what recognition could bring to a person and how successful it can be for all companies around the world! You were a great group to work along side with last week and I look forward to many more shows in the future on the West Coast!\n\n170#Western Allstars|Great job on site yesterday with eBay and Bank of the West! We're starting to see some real progress in our territory and I'm excited for what's in store for us this year! Let's keep at it!\n\n171#It Takes A Village!|Sheri, Mirfie, John, Leslie and Marie,  I want to thank each of you for taking the time to sit with me one-on-one during my first few weeks to share your insights, wisdom and experiences. Your direction and guidance has been invaluable in helping me get acclimated to my role and to Globoforce. I know there's still much to learn and I'm grateful to have such a supportive and skilled group to glean from.\n\n172#Dream Team|Thank you all for meeting at 9pm on Wednesday the night before the WorkHuman Regional Forum to help set up. We had the entire event set up in 45 minutes! Record time! You all put in the extra time to make sure we had everything needed to have a seamless and stress-free event.   Naomi - thanks for knocking it out of the park during your presentations and keeping the audience engaged. Also, thank you all for your insightful feedback post-event. We'll be sure to incorporate these ideas going forward.\n\n173#HE Tech Super Stars|Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to staff HR Tech this year.  Several things happened, we had a brand new booth with new activations, a new product announcement, and additional hands that were experts on our new product Conversations.  You all handled it like we go out this way every month.  Everyone jumped in to have discussions, help people with our various activations (spin the wheel, answer a question and get some candy) and scanned everyone that came within inches of our carpet.  We even had a small group come through and Ken held their undivided attention for 5 minutes (that was as long as we could keep them) for a special expo hall tour.  Everyone worked well together and when something popped up, you made sure that someone was there to cover if you needed to step away.  Thank you!\n\n174#It takes a village|I want to thank each of you for having the courage and determination to try new avenues, test new ground, and most importantly share back with me what's worked for you with your prospects with the diversity and inclusion sales collateral. I appreciate that each of you has taken the time to internalize the D&I messaging and training given back in the spring and leveraged it to pursue opportunities to open doors and make new connections with Top 10/Strategic 25 accounts. You have demonstrated that it has helped you with discovery about your accounts in new and different ways, so opening up this avenue has led to richer opportunities. Your collective voice and experiences add to our learning, allowing us to know what to Start, Stop and Continue, so please keep the feedback loop going and help us with continuing to strengthen the connection between recognition and measuring diversity, inclusion and belonging. Thanks!\n\n175#It takes a village|Thank you all for your help in my certification prep! Between the slide deck, the demo and my nerves you were all great and played a part in my preparation and helping me pass. Now I look forward to collaborating on SALES! Best to all!!!!\n\n176#Certification Completed! You're on your way!|Marie, congrats on completing your sales certification on Friday. Well done!!! Your level of preparation and skill was on display for all to see. You nailed it! I am certain that this will be the jumping off point to many more successes and we all believe you have an incredible run ahead of you. I also want to call you out for your teamwork, collaboration, effort, poise, responsiveness, commitment and attitude as you've launched your career at Globoforce. Since starting at WorkHuman everyone of us have benefited when you're in the room. To me, this is a tangible asset that your customers/prospects will no doubt experience for themselves! I'm so excited to see you flourish in your role and I'm proud to call you a colleague.\n\n177#Practice makes progress|Your work ethic and your inability to accept anything less than perfection is what is going to make us a very successful team. The amount of time and effort that you put into your certification is evident by the confidence, comfort, and knowledge you displayed in this mornings presentation. The way you engaged the room drew everyone in and created the want for us to participate. You crushed it and I am confident that as a team we will do great things!\n\n178#Bootcamp Gold Coin Winners!!!|Thank you all for your participation in the 2017 Sales Bootcamp.  Your input and points brought up in Bootcamp help create a collaborative atmosphere where everyone shared best practices and great ways to go to market with our customers.

I truly appreciate the time, constructive feedback and support as I worked through my deck, demo and prep for Tuesday. I'm going to miss our trips to Framingham - and the castle - but I know we'll be keeping in touch to share ideas, celebrate success and learn from each other.\n\n180#Two \"Newbie\" Heads Are Better Than One!|Marie, better late than never!  It's been great getting to know you through on-boarding and I wanted to thank you for answering my questions about the RFP structure in your last organization. I was asked to review and provide notes on a Canadian Prospect's RFP based on my competitive insight, which greatly benefited from your contributions as well! Thanks for making me look good!\n\n181#Exciting Team!|Marie, thank you so much for your hard work on our presentation. You have been extremely welcoming and helpful since day one!
