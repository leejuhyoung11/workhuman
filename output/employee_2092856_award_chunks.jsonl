"0#Quick alignment!|Pam, thank you for seeking alignment on WGD efforts last week with short notice when we faced uncertainty and quickly needed the approval of our VPs to stay on track. We had a very tight deadline to meet and without any hesitation, you got the conversation going and off we went. You’ve been the voice of reason for many years here and we will be sad to see you go and miss your smiling face in the office. I wanted to get this over to you before you go! Thank you and best of luck to you!\n\n1#Thank you for your partnership!|Thank you all for a successful first meeting of the digital advisory committee! All of you shared personal insight and perspective that was extremely valuable in setting the stage for our executive council session. We are extremely excited about how the conversation will continue to grow and evolve moving forward and your voice will be a vital component to shape and maximize our web impact! Thank you all!\n\n2#All the media!|Team - Thank you for an exceptional presentation of your paid media plan today for driving 2H growth and unlocking more opportunity for our company. The image here shows the determination, focus, and careful planning this cross-functional team has put forward. I look forward to refining and finalizing the plan together. Keep up the great work. With gratitude, -C\n\n3#I see you|Pam, I wanted to take a minute to thank you for consistently leading with empathy. I’m sure it’s not easy having such a large team, but you always make yourself available and take the time to check-in, to listen if we need an ear, to understand what the struggles are so you can help clear any roadblocks, and to offer advice or constructive feedback when and where needed. It’s been a crazy year, full of a lot of change, excitement, increased workloads, and shifting priorities - I really appreciate the fact that you have verbally recognized all of this one more than one occasion, that you have related, and have supported and promoted good mental health practices to offset any increased stress. Thanks for your support - I personally have felt seen and heard, and just want you to know that I appreciate it all.\n\n4#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n5#Welcome Committee|When I asked if you would help in welcoming my new team member Anna to the Workhuman family, you all stepped right up!! I can’t thank you enough for taking time out of your busy schedules to have a conversation with Anna on the ins and outs of Workhuman, along with giving her an overview of your roles and how both of our teams connect. Also, my team is so fortunate to have the support from all of you!! I can’t thank you for the many times that I’ve bothered you (especially at the last minute) to help me craft responses for prospects/customers. Many of my counterparts in the RFP trade don’t have this level of relationships with SMEs or people within their organizations. My team is very blessed to have you all as partners!!  Thank you for all that you do! Michael\n\n6#You put Spring in my step|Thank you team! I very much appreciate the help, dedication, preparation and execution in the past weeks leading up to today's All Hands. We developed the agenda, built content, created visuals, dealt with final logistics...no matter what the ask, you all dedicated time and energy to deliver and make it seamless. And Aaron, wow - above and beyond to commit and join us from your vacation too!This felt a lot like when we prep for a prospect presentation, so now we wait for the feedback to learn if we were downselected, got VOC or earned the win! 😉   Thanks again the help ~ I really appreciate the teamwork! (and I'm sure you all appreciate that I didn't continue down my corny path of puns...they don't 'succ'...all I could do not to weave in how y'all were just dandy putting the petal to the metal...)\n\n7#Making it Perfect ! part 2|I forgot to add Pam to this list! I can't thank you all enough for all the time and effort you are putting in to make my life easier. You all are putting so much time in and racking your brain in how to fix my Dashboard and redirect leads and MQL's . I really appreciate everything you do for me to make my life easier and so I can make better use of my time and be more useful to my team so they can get more meetings and close more deals!\n\n8#Operating with Excellence and Agility|Pam - Outstanding job bringing Jason, Steve C, me, and the rest of the Sales Ops and Finance team through our first Marketing Ops review today. The materials were well thought out and the discussion was exceptionally well facilitated. You've brought forward a new discipline around top of funnel management that collectively I know is highly valued across these stakeholders. As a result of your leadership we have an enhanced level of awareness for which levers to pull and when. And you've established this as an important forum we'll use to manage the business. Our plans will always be dynamic, and we'll never get it exactly right on the first pass - you've effectively acknowledged this and have created pathways for dialogue and an ongoing planning with our partners that ensure we're taking an agile approach to top of funnel goals. With gratitude, -C\n\n9#Nine Years Going Strong|It all started back in 2012!  It's wild to think of the changes the 3 of us have seen over the last 9 years at Workhuman.  Looking back, the two of you have always there.  From day one I knew if I needed anything - from support, advice, a laugh or even just a kick in the @$$ - I could turn to Pam or Mark.  Your leadership has shaped me in so many ways.  Thank you both for always being my constant.  Let's go another nine years together!\n\n10#Special Edition Team Meeting|Pam, thank you for hosting an **employee appreciation day special edition** of our team meeting today! I haven’t laughed like that at work in a while, and it was a much needed respite from the craziness of our day-to-day. I really appreciate the time and thought you put into the whole thing. The team jeopardy game was a hoot (I’m still dying from the John Cena reference) and the cupcakes were such a thoughtful gesture (especially since you custom ordered them for each of us based on our individual likes!). Thank you for taking the time to organize this for the team and for recognizing that we could all use a break from the daily grind. Laughter is food for the soul and it was much appreciated!\n\n11#Creative discussion partners!|Team, thank you for your participation, creative discussion and investment in our process of defining Marketing KPIs as we envision our plan for development. I was inspired and motivated by your expertise and feedback during our session yesterday. This has truly been a team effort held up by all humans involved! I'm excited to see where our imagination and determination take marketing analytics.\n\n12#ABM Mythbusters|Pam / Krista,  Thank you, both, for spending additional time to brainstorm and talk through the challenges, structure and potential solutions for the ABM team and its future.  The ever-thought provoking balance between field marketing and ABM each play a vital role in lead gen and pipeline support.    I truly appreciate your on-going collaboration as we continue to evolve the team towards greatness!\n\n13#Forecasting 2021|Pam,  fantastic job presenting the MQL Forecast for 2021.   You have put so much work and strategic planning into 2021 and it was great to see the excitement about the future for all those efforts.  MQL's are an important part of the entire business and you laid out the foundation for what will be a great year.  Thanks for all you do and I look forward to seeing it all unfold!\n\n14#13,000 MQLs? ... by when?!|Team - Outstanding presentation today with Steve, Jason and myself regarding a disciplined and proactive projection of MQLs by quarter and program. This represents a new high water mark of organization, data-driven insights, and focus being brought to our joint sales and marketing planning and execution process. Thank you for standing up a framework that will become the bedrock of subsequent monthly operational reviews. Your focus on results through careful planning and accountability comes through clearly. With gratitude, -C\n\n15#Crushin' the (sales) calendar|Team - outstanding job organizing and communicating our plan and schedule of joint sales and marketing campaigns for Q1. The level of coordination and detail was very well received on the SLT call this week. Success is connected to exceptional execution of a shared plan. I believe we are in great position for this as evidenced by the ramp up in registrations for our upcoming customer webinar. Well done. With gratitude, -C\n\n16#Marketer or Marketeer?|No matter which way you market yourself, Amy and I wanted to thank this entire team for the investment over the last few weeks, leading up to today - our first integrated planning offsite of 2021! You invested your time, energy, mind and heart in the offsite topics and each other. We appreciate the opportunity for transparency, communication and idea sharing around two of our most important upcoming initiatives between the Brand Relaunch and WH Live. We're both excited to be aligned, looking forward to building out integrated marketing plans together, and thrilled to be on this journey with each of you. Onward we go! Z & Amy\n\n17#Improving communications between Marketing & Sales|Pam I want to thank you for showing great urgency on an action to help align the sales and marketing teams today. This morning I mentioned it would be valuable to have a visible place for the sales team to access the marketing calendar. Before the day was over you had it placed on Seismic so everyone can get access. Thank you!\n\n18#Zoom, zoom, zoom around with me!|Tim, Camila, Doug, Pam, Michelle, Donna-Louise and Olga, it was such a pleasure meeting you all on our zoom around this week! I loved how each of you were so real, so authentic and openly shared your joys during the pandemic. I know i certainly learned a lot about each of you in such a short amount of time together and am can't wait to learn more. You are fascinating humans; juggling families, new homes, co-working with significant others, and balancing work/life during these crazy times. I'm in awe of each of you and I really am looking forward to catching up in person one day for that hug. 🤗\n\n19#New Year Goals|Thank you all for providing your feedback on the speakers bureau as we closed out 2020. This recognition is long overdue (holiday brain) but it was extremely helpful to hear your goals for the new year to better understand how the bureau can support upcoming projects with speaking engagements. Whether you walked us through a planning deck, sent notes via email, or participated in an open dialogue - it all helped to shape our ‘21 planning efforts.\n\n20#Westward Bound|Team, I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the great work and quick decision-making that has been happening with the West Coast campaign. I really appreciate all that has been done. This moment comes off the back of a great creative review that happened yesterday, where we were able to collaborate on feedback and expectations, all while reviewing the first creative test run of our refreshed look. There's a million reasons this all could have gotten derailed, and it hasn't. We're SO CLOSE to it being live and out the door, and I really just want to take a moment to appreciate what we are accomplishing as a group. Dianne for driving and keeping us on target; Laura and Pam for the direction and productive feedback; Katie and Dario for your feedback and eye for best practices; Lauren our wordsmith; and Alana, for your patience, diligence, and creative effort bringing it all together in a fresh new look, while having to build in an unfamiliar platform, with new types of deliverables... Guys, this is the type of collaboration that will really take us to a new level. Looking forward to launch :)\n\n21#Raising the Bar|On behalf of Chris and myself, we wanted to shout from the roof tops about what a great job you did with the vendor strategy for Demand Generation and engagement management technology.  You put in place a solid process of due diligence that included a strong panel of key stakeholders.  Your careful decision consideration criteria and recommendation process has elevated and will accelerate our ability to reach and engage ICPs historically out of reach or out of sight.  You made the decision to work with 6sense an easy one...not to mention that we will enhance TCO.  Here's to raising the bar!!!\n\n22#Fresh thinking|Pam and Devin, thank you so much for a great discussion on how to best up-level our webinars moving forward. Pam, we’ve had a lot of success to date but one never gets ahead by standing still and I appreciate you pushing the team and I to always be looking ahead, to be innovative and think outside the box. Devin, your fresh perspective is much appreciated! You’re a treasure trove of great ideas and I really appreciate you allowing us to pick your brain for an hour. I’m looking forward to working with you more in the future and am grateful for the opportunity to learn from you. I’m also super excited to explore the ideas we discussed and put them into practice. There’s no question that they will only serve to enrich the experience for registrants and attendees alike and up-level our webinar game. Thank you both!\n\n23#But you \"made it work\" in 2020!|Team - Tim Gunn was right! We had very ambitious plans for 2020! And then they all changed to a \"different set\" of \"very ambitious\" endeavors and goals ... and you thrived, moved the organization forward to growth, and made sure businesses knew what's next, started now! Thank you for major contributions like: Implementing a data-driven approach to lead generation and pipeline growth resulting in significant growth of MQLs to 10,000!; Launching our first-ever TV and OTT ads; Helping executives unlock grand gestures of gratitude through Team Awards; Developing and delivering two WHLs (albeit in very different ways than originally planned); And helping grow our Employee Experience to rank on the Great Places to Work in 2020! Way to rock it out in 2020, and show 2021 a preview of what a human centered, impact driven approach looks like. Thank you for a terrific year of results, teamwork, support of our stakeholder partners, and resiliency through and through. With gratitude, -C\n\n24#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n25#Winner, Winner ... Turkey Dinner?!|Kristen, Kelsey, Pam - Congratulations on your \"win\" as determined by a selection of your Customer Marketing peers in the first-ever, inaugural, \"Design Your Own Turkey Headband\". It was a hotly contested and spirited competition that will surely become a favorite tradition! Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n26#Company Overview Document|Ilana & Pam - thank you both for your support over the past week to help create a document that did not exist last week. We needed a quick one or two page document that helps tell our story. What we had did not capture what was needed. Both of you jumped on this and a few days later developed a great document. Thank you both for the urgency to help get this produced.\n\n27#2021 Marketing Planning Pros!|So, we didn’t quite spend 6 hours together today but pretty close to it! Add in previous working sessions, the pre-work PLUS the work to come, and we will easily surpass that. BUT in the end, we'll be poised and ready to execute a solid plan for the new year. We appreciate your commitment to the 2021 marketing planning process. We’re taking a different approach this year and we’re coming close to the 10-month mark of working remotely during an epic year of CRAZY. With so many players involved, different points of view, and known foundational gaps like solid messaging – (YES, we know, we know!)…it’s not an easy task. We are optimistic about the progress we’re making together. We are grateful for your focus on the end goal and how we'll get there. Thank you for partnering with us to sharpen our strategies and set our teams up to properly support the business in 2021. Onward we go! Z + Amy\n\n28#Utilizing Your Network|Pam, Alex Paz and myself wanted to thank you for connecting us with your contact at Boston Scientific. We just got off a call with him and he gave us some great information and is helping to connect us with a colleague in HR. Thank you so much for your willingness to help!\n\n29#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n30#these are my people|This award is incredibly overdue for my people; and I apologize if this feels impersonal as one gratitude moment, but I need these humans to know (LIKE, NOW) how much I appreciate them.  The last couple of months have been by far the most challenging I've experienced in my professional life.  Don't tell IT but this laptop may have flown across the room a time or two! (Hey.. maybe that's why my speakers don't work??)  But I have to remind myself, we're doing big things.  The excitement I have in Workhuman, and all of it's fast-paced, innovative goodness, far exceeds the hard days.  And you know what else knocks the stress on it's ass?  YOU.  Each one of you have played a pivotal role in the growth of this organization, team and myself.  Your impact is beyond words; they wouldn't even do my appreciation justice.  Please a moment this weekend to think about how great you are; how hard you work; and how much better you make my world.  Thank you Andy.  Thank you Chris.  Thank you Miguel.  Thank you Kristie.  Thank you Mark.  Thank you Jason.  Thank you Anthony.  Thank you Krista.  Thank you Erik.  Thank you Pam.\n\n31#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n32#🙌🏻 Upleveling our Team Updates 🙌🏻|Week in and week out, each of you contribute to a few different communication vehicles we have to keep our team and stakeholders across the company up to date on all the amazing things that are happening in the world of Marketing. About a month or so ago, I came to the team with a new process for pulling together our weekly updates and challenged each of us to think about the intended audience and what would be most valuable to them...We started including more metrics and other performance data in our look-backs and introduced headlines to provide more focus. We are also incorporating more visuals to keep the content fresh and engaging. We held each other accountable to sticking to a standard template and hitting deadlines so that we could get the updates edited and out the door in a timely fashion. I know between the weekly marketing updates, the digital programming status reports and ELT progress updates, you probably feel like this is communication overload at times, but they are important in staying connected and current especially when we are all remote. I sincerely appreciate your part in helping to improve the quality. THANK YOU!\n\n33#Moving Moments|Thank you all for playing an integral role in our Change Management workshop to work through how to effectively roll out DG 2.0 to sales. Your input will help inform the strategy and ensures we are taking your day-to-day processes into account when working through all of these new initiatives. Thank you again for dedicating a few hours of your day to this discussion and ensuring a solid partnership between marketing and sales.\n\n34#Marketing Calendar & Focus on Results|Pam I want to thank you for the extra hard work you have done over the past 60 days as we built out our marketing plans for Q3 and Q4. You not only shaped our strategy you are in every day help ensure we drive the metrics needed on MQL and pipeline for us to reach out goals. Thank you!\n\n35#2nd half marketing plan - Drive 4 RQ pipeline|Chris & Pam thank you for the efforts over the past several months to map out a marketing plan designed to help us drive our MQL's and 4 RQ pipeline. Several key events for the team to leverage. The combo of account focus (ICP) and events offers a strong pathway to success. Look forward to the continued focus on hitting all of our pipeline targets.\n\n36#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n37#Guiding Light!|Not the soap opera! Thank you for all your support last week through the H2 planning process. From sharing your insights and perspectives on our Tuesday presentations to helping me navigate and complete the H2 brief for my program during our Friday call - your unwavering support gave me the strength I needed to push through and make it all come together. You also shared feedback on Evanta in a timely manner for me to share with them so that we could quickly act to re-imagine our sponsorship in creative ways that fit our business needs. I appreciate your attention to the needs at hand, and being available to answer my questions and concerns and provide feedback and share insights to keep work progressing forward. Thanks for all of your much needed support!\n\n38#Collaboration at it’s Finest|Thank you all for being so invested in the Demand Gen 2.0 project. From the start, you have helped marketing define lead scoring, create sales plays, and define our Tier 1 account list - which will ultimately accelerate deals. We genuinely appreciate your dedication to this new process. This wouldn’t be successful without your invaluable insights, questions, and partnership. We look forward to continuing to work together to evolve our marketing and sales strategy!\n\n39#Welcoming to the Team|Pam, thank you so much for all you have done to include Dario and I into your team! I was skeptical of a new daily meeting, but it REALLY works. I feel more connected to teammates during these last few weeks than I have for months. I am so happy to continue my Workhuman journey under your leadership.\n\n40#Allow me to introduce our 6th team member ... \"Mo\"|As in \"Mo\"-mentum ... Team, great series of discussions, debate, and innovative thinking being brought to our 2H planning through the last 3 weeks of collaborative planning sessions! Excited to see we're wrestling the plan to ground with a mix of data, curiosity and grit! ... Biggest pipeline ever here we come!! With gratitude, -C\n\n41#Thank you!|Pam - I want to thank you for all your support over these last few months. These are trying times, but your mentorship and ability to navigate through challenges have been incredibly helpful. I look forward to being able to connect with you every month. It is refreshing to be able to have discussions with you about the future of the business, or what we can double down on for ABM to help the teams work together. Thank you for being a great teammate!\n\n42#The power of indirect influence at State Street|Pam, I want to thank you for your indirect influence on a major stakeholder in State Street's implementation of WH. Your friend Nikki while not part of the direct decision making group undoubtedly has a tremendous amount of influence and a strong voice in the direction they take moving forward.  Her level of engagement has been very high and it almost as if she was brain washed a little going in using our talk track and being an advocate of what we're trying to do for companies.  When our sales team reaches out to those in non-sales roles asking for help this is a perfect example of how engaging with a non-decision maker can be helpful to the business!  THANK YOU!\n\n43#Putting the A+ in Alignment Session|Team - thank you for an outstanding call today that unlocked great alignment on near term initiatives and opened the door to exciting future business opportunity topics we’ll tackle together. Wanted to recognize the productivity of our call, partnership and open mindedness demonstrated. With gratitude, -C\n\n44#Leadership|Pam - I want to say how thankful I am for our working relationship always, but especially lately. I feel like we're in sync on initiatives and I'm very impressed by your leadership and input on various projects. You've taken on a larger team, remotely, and have managed to keep us all connected, engaged, and focused. This can be a hard task to navigate while managing all of your own initiatives - which we know are a lot right now! Thanks for being a wonderful mentor and leader throughout it all!\n\n45#Putting the \"Lift off\" in \"Kick off\"|Team - as workplaces everywhere contemplate the next phase of work, we are leading the way in what that looks like externally and with our customers. It also means we need to evolve internally. I was so impressed by the team work and open mindedness demonstrated by this cross-functional group in today's kick off! So, as they say, \"Houston, we have lift off!\" Excited to see where this group takes the next phase of what it means to thrive and workhuman. With gratitude, -C\n\n46#Fast help for team|Pam wanted to say thank for your quick follow up to support a key executive demo next week. Within minutes of the request you had help secure the support needed. Thank you!\n\n47#Setting our team up for success!|Pam, you truly set all of us all up for success with WHL follow-up strategy. You kept us well informed, aligned and doing the best work we can. We couldn't have brought all of it together without you. Even with all of the quick turns and pivots, you kept our team marching to the same goal and the collaboration was flowing so freely. Thanks again for leading us and getting us to the finish line!!\n\n48#Keeping Humanity Alive with Live!|Team – Thank you for delivering a high quality, compelling, on brand, and “of the moment” digital event. In less than six weeks you expertly pivoted from the cancellation of our physical events in San Antonio and Dublin and leaped into bold new thinking that resulted in our Workhuman Live Stream event. You were fearless in pursuit of our audacious goal of 10,000 registrants and charged furiously at it – obliterating the goal and achieving more than 15,000+ registrants. This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best. This is a significant achievement in the company’s history and will continue to pay dividends in the following areas: Social reach; The launch of our new products like Moodtracker; Deepening existing customer relationships; Establishing strong new footholds with future customers; And growing profitably. My hat’s off to you all – when Humanity needed us most – you all rallied to give Humanity the company it needed now more than ever. On behalf of the Leadership Team and myself, Thank you - Eric\n\n49#Detailed Plan for Marketing Success|Would like to take this opportunity to thank Pam for showing great urgency as we detail the marketing follow up for our events. We had a call on Monday and discussed the need for a more detailed plan. By Tuesday morning Pam had a solid plan in place. Thank you Pam for your dedication and follow up to ensure we capitalize on our events.\n\n50#Spotlight Speaker Success Stories|Team - thank you for stepping into the spotlight during our last three marketing town halls. You’ve shown at an exemplary level of innovation, determination, and grit amidst our new normal. You’ve conveyed your success stories (Merck webinar, Keeping work human series, and WHL) with an awesome combination of humility and accessibility. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being leaders of the moment and in the moment. The best practices you’ve shared and modeled to achieve such high levels of success are great guideposts and shining examples of a high performing culture ! Well done and with gratitude, -C\n\n51#Wait! Was that really only 90 days?!|Team - Thank you for making this next phase of our journey and evolution together as a team so successful! Lets just say the first 60 day together were much different than our last 30 days together(ish)! Wanted to celebrate all we’ve done together in our first 3 months as a team. Attached is my quick recap and where I see us delivering results in Q2. Thank you, I’m truly appreciative of all you do!  With gratitude, -C\n\n52#To the team that \"broke\" SHRM.com! ...|Team - First thank you for your OUTSTANDING work on the concept, design, and run up to the Merck+SHRM webinar! This is going to be so successful because the content is OF THE MOMENT RELEVANT and it's being told through the lens of what a real-life customer is doing RIGHT NOW to lean in to  recognition amidst crisis-laden uncertain times. I am so proud of the alignment and partnership you've demonstrated with our entire Sales and CS organizations - TREMENDOUS teamwork! In less than four weeks you've taken an idea, pivoted and evolved content to match the market where it's at, secure a key customer, successfully execute our highest-ever webinar registration count, and partner with SHRM, another thought leader in our industry ... that alone is a massively high bar ... but response was so strong, this campaign overwhelmed SHRM.com's technology and we had to cap registration at 3,200 ... you turned what could be a \" :( face\"  moment around by innovating and proactively communication solutions to our Sales and CS leaders. You all are a FORCE to be reckoned with, and have fueled our brand and our mission greatly by showing what success looks like. I am honored to work alongside such a talented, agile, and forward-looking group of marketeers. So, yeah, I guess you could say, you're a big deal! ... Well done! With gratitude, -C\n\n53#Thank you for Daring Greatly|Pam, I wanted to sincerely thank you for your understanding, guidance, open communication and caring in the midst of all the uncertainty and challenges that we’re faced with. I really appreciate you holding true to your commitment to keep the team informed – our quick daily check-ins as a team have been super helpful (and have also provided a daily dose of laughter). I know things are moving at a rapid pace, so it’s nice to feel that we’re kept in the loop on the latest initiatives and updates across the board. What’s really stood out to me however is how you always start the meeting asking, very sincerely, how everyone is doing. You’ve been super honest, very open, and at times even vulnerable by sharing personal stories or personal feelings in the midst of everything going on. By doing so, you’ve established a higher level of trust, and I am very grateful to have such an empathetic leader for our team. Thank you for the open communication, for always checking-in, and for all the wonderful advice and guidance you’ve given me.\n\n54#Thankful|I wanted to take a moment and say how thankful I am for this team. Ever since Demand Gen and Field Marketing joined one team, we're communicating and collaborating more than ever. Everyone on this team brings a unique skill set and is more than willing to offer their expertise on any project. Each member of this team is humble, but yet, a rock star.   Laura - Your execution and thoughtfulness on projects is so impressive.  Jeff - Your eagerness to jump right into projects is really standing out.  Diane - You're quiet, but mighty. You always ask the right questions and think of every detail. Mark - I really appreciate the insight you bring to every project and the constant collaboration. Pam - Your leadership and consistent communication with the team has made this difficult time much easier.  Ryan - I'm always amazed with the projects you work on and the detail you put into them. Stacey - Thanks for stepping up and helping support Field Marketing during a time when it is needed.  Thanks team, I appreciate you all!\n\n55#Webinar Tenacity!|Laura, Pam, and Jess, I have been totally impressed by the focus you have put into the upcoming Webinar and the tenacity you have exhibited in making sure we get everything we need.  From securing a great client, to pivoting on the fly the topic to be more relevant to these challenging times, to getting our partner to share info with us that they normally don't, to making sure we have all that info in our systems and communicated out to the company, you have done it all with a great spirit of teamwork.  Thank you all for all you do and I can't wait to see what comes of it!!!\n\n56#Best. Team. Ever.|Thank you for a great Zoom meeting to align around our short term priorities while daring to dream and proactively plan for longer term priorities. Not an easy task to do when the \"here and now\" is all anyone of us can think about lately. I was so impressed with everyone's willingness to think about team resources in a different way and also our shared commitment to the good work and strategic thinking that we already did together pre COVID-19 crisis. This was my most productive meeting of the day and an awesome way to end the week. I am grateful for this awesome team. Thank you!\n\n57#Just a little Patience....|Guns and Roses, right?! Just a little Patience!!!! I wanted to thank the team for quick help, guidance, and yes, PATIENCE while we sorted our strategy for the Merck upcoming webinar. With many moving parts and things not being as straight forward as normal, I very much appreciate the teams willingness to help take a step back and inform the team and keep us in in check with the direction and the good work that has taken place to build the content! Thanks for being such great team mates!\n\n58#CSR Committee|A heartfelt note of gratitude for your overwhelming and immediate support of our CSR initiative. In the midst of all that is unfolding across the company as we respond to COVID-19, you found the time to join our little committee and came up with several outstanding ideas in no time at all! We are rallying around those ideas and from it will emerge a short and long-term plan to further our impact on lives and communities. Onward and forward!\n\n59#Helping Excellence Become A Reality|Along with Rosette and the team (Omar, Naomi, Amanda and Krista) we would like to thank this amazing group of colleagues who joined us with little notice to be the Alpha Testers  of a new workshop we have created for prospects and maybe even customers –  Keeping Work Human.  Like the judges on America’s Got Talent, you silently sat then gave your direct, candid review verbally (and then used Conversations to deliver the feedback in writing).   You shared your collective wisdom, gave us thoughts on how to improve and then hit the gold button - so next stop is to take the show on the road.  Off to TX we (virtually) go to deliver this to USAA and there is a potential of General Mills in Minnesota next and maybe even Memorial Hermann Health System  Rosette and all of us that worked many hours on this workshop  appreciate you all so much for jumping with little notice and helping us all prepare to deliver excellence.\n\n60#Well that was NOT in my 30/60/90 day plan! ...|Team - A quick thank you to celebrate being 60 days in together. You continue to adapt to the businesses needs and lead through uncertain times with a high demonstrated commitment to the priorities we've aligned on to grow the business - ie., Build the brand; Acquire new customer; Grow existing customers; and Build our culture through people. Although COVID was in NO ONE'S playbook, you rallied and risen to this new challenge by partnering with me on a slightly \"revised\" version of my 30/60/90 plan. This is having such a positive halo effect on our teams. Look forward to the next 30 days of the plan ... whatever that looks, and with confidence that if we need to write it 1 page, 1 day at a time - this is the team I'm excited to do it with. Stay healthy, human, and connected! With gratitude, -C\n\n61#Always being there!|Pam, thank you for joining our BDR team meetings to keep us up on any new marketing initiatives/content/developments/campaigns/ideas/etc! You have always been an a tremendous partner with sales and thank you for helping us stay connected during this time.\n\n62#Making COVID Connections for Merck|While we're still in the process of creating a webinar for Merck, I had to pause and appreciate the amount of effort that has gone into creating an exceptional experience and one that ties into the current pandemic situation. In the span of the week, we've pivoted and changed the focus of the webinar altogether to be timely, considerate and ties into concerns of the greater HR community, while also being in line with the vision that our contacts at Merck have. That includes multiple revisions of content, shepherding and managing approvals of interested parties. Not to mention creating a final piece that will speak to the strong partnership we have with Merck, as well as the human messaging we want to have in the market. Despite the constant changes, I walk away from of all of our brainstorming sessions feeling energized and excited at the story we are weaving, supplemented by WARI data. Thank you all for the talent, commitment and passion you have brought and continue bringing to this effort.\n\n63#Delivering the Human Touch|When the COVID-19 pandemic began to accelerate, our marketing instinct immediately went to providing a human face on our content. There is no more powerful thought leadership than humans speaking with humans – sharing experiences, emotions, and best practices on how best to craft a path forward in these unprecedented times. That was the inspiration for the daily video series, “Keeping Work Human,” which launched last week amid the flurry of everything else we are working on. James and Matt – you stepped up and deftly handled the logistics of turning a Zoom video conference call into usable, shareable video. Pam – you project-managed the overall logistics, setting up the invites, and showing agility when we had to pivot. Amy – you immediately energized your team to schedule guest speakers. Mike – you were at the ready to transition the videos to Workhuman Radio podcasts. Sarah and Jess – you stepped up to write the question frameworks and provide a content resource. John and Diane – you saw what was happening and introduced better discipline and process. Jen – you were our first guest and dazzled our viewers with unique leadership best practices to manage remote teams. And Steve – our host – your ability to set the tone, and keep our guests at ease with your authenticity and humble heart, is what makes it all work. We’ve only just begun – and we have a busy few weeks ahead – but I couldn’t be prouder of this team and the messaging we are bringing to market.\n\n64#Sharing is caring|High 5s to you 5 fine humans! Why you ask? I pulled together a marketplace update over the weekend but with more than a dozen companies to track, I knew I could not do it alone. I asked the marketing leaders who could help out and Dan and John - you both didn't blink raising your hand to chip in. Dan - your team is cranking out thoughtful content every day but you generously offered to let Jess H help with this. John - first you said you could ask your team to help but then you decided to take on the extra workload yourself! Jess - you were quick, thorough and proactively reached out to me with your specific updates throughout the week. But, as the week went on and our COVID related scope of work kept growing, I knew I had to reassess how we resourced the efforts so that we could provide timely updates to Sales and the entire organization. Pam - I went to you next and asked if I could enlist Mark's help. And you too, didn't hesitate a second. You quickly talked to Mark and followed up to tell me he'd be in touch. Within hours, Mark not only proactively reached out to me for the download but he took the project on with ease and enthusiasm and delivered a new update of today's marketplace COVID related activity Hugely valuable. Thank you all! I love this team and this great example of teamwork at its finest.\n\n65#Is it still Wednesday?|Team -  First, thank you - often and always.  Second, I want to acknowledge we are operating in unprecedented times. This can trigger feelings of discomfort and anxiety if you let it. But, I believe we are strong enough together to rally, support, and mobilize each other to overcome that potential because you all as leaders already have. Know that every moment of progress you’ve made this week already illustrates your strength, determination, and grit.  In the broader context - none of us are guaranteed a tomorrow - COVID may exacerbate that mindset - but in reality this too shall pass and we all will be stronger from it - personally and professionally.  I believe in you. And I believe in us together. Our collective strengths to overcome and our true human spirit to persevere will best this.  I am honored to serve alongside you in the pursuit of our brand, our customers, and the greater community we serve.  Thank you for all your support, kindness, and compassion you've extended to me this week!  With gratitude, -C\n\n66#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n67#First Class Collaboration|Team! I wanted to say congratulations and celebrate the collaboration that infused our FY20 Marketing Strategy Board. As of this past Friday we have an aligned, crisp, and clear plan for Marketing's focus and KPIs that sits perfectly between the Company's goals, objectives, and major priorities. I also want to recognize the diligence that went into to making this be a plan that effectively spans Customer + Brand Marketing and reflects alignment with our key partners (SLT, CS, CX, and Finance). It is metrics driven to ensure accountability and through it's more streamlined nature, now infinitely more shareable with our teams and partners. Look forward to rolling this out to the teams through all hands these next two weeks and continuing to revisit it for focus, alignment, and relevance to the business's needs as our business evolves. Love to see the positive momentum and teamwork modeled to produce this output - lets keep it going. With gratitude, -C\n\n68#Quick Thinking!|Pam - thank you so much for thinking of reaching back out to Jeff when it came to kicking off and hiring for Jill's open coordinator position. Because of you, he was able to be given a fair shot at a role that seems as though it was made for him, and now he gets to be a part of the Workhuman family! This is such a win not only for Jeff as a candidate, but for us as an organization!\n\n69#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n70#Feeling connected|Pam and Jill - I wanted to say thank you for the warm welcome you've both provided to me as I made the move into the Customer Marketing team this quarter. Not only do I feel a personal connection strengthening between us, I feel our work is becoming more and more connected which is exactly part of our vision! You've both been proactively bringing me into various discussions and meetings and totally receptive to my ideas. As you know, Eric B and I often joked that we were often forgotten in our previous Product Marketing roles. There was some truth behind the joking. We had each other but I never truly felt like part of a team and now, I do - thanks in large part to you both! I hope you agree that we are getting into a good groove and are happy about the progress we're making on our strategic marketing plan. I am very excited to partner with you and the rest of our group to bring the plan to life and accomplish amazing things together this year. Go Team!!\n\n71#Best First 30 Days Ever!|Team - I was reflecting on how much we've accomplished during our first month together. I selected Urgency for this note because it best reflects what all of you have demonstrated - ie., the asap tackling of tough challenges with a sense of Shoshin (初心) a word from Zen Buddhism meaning \"beginner's mind.\" To me this means displaying an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. This truly captures the dynamic we've co-built and are accelerating progress in. A quick recap of five significant things we've accomplished together: 1.) Alignment with cross functional partners (SLT, CS/CX, and MLT); 2.) Re-organizing to achieve FY20 priorities and accelerate growth; 3.) Moving the needle toward stronger, crisper, more provocative marketing messages; 4.) As leaders, together, building a shared model of transparency, trust, and robust debate; and 5.) Leveling up to strategic joint business planning. In ways big and small you have made me feel welcome, informed, and more self-aware of how to build a successful team. Jill from our dine around and leadership on Demand 2.0, to Pam with your advice on language for positioning the re-org, to Jeff from your \"get it done and here's what I need from you clarity\" on all things WHL audience acquisition and shared love of sarcasm, to Z your willingness to be the glue between teams and dedicate source for Girl Scout cookies - I want to say thank you for all we've done together and a \"save\" a future thank you for all we will do together. Happy Friday to all - keep up the great human work - it matters. With gratitude, -C\n\n72#People-First Leadership|Team - I wanted to recognize the effort that went into our recent Customer Marketing re-alignment. Driven by and reflective of your input and support we implemented changes that were perceived positively by the business, and by - putting people first and considering the human aspects involved in change - have been received positively as growth and on-strategy changes by the great humans that make up the Customer Marketing organization. I thought it was important to celebrate this moment, because change is often scary, especially for teams in flux - but your advice and guidance around putting people first (always) directly influenced a plan that was highly communicative, well-scheduled, and well-executed by all involved. We are well on our way to the modernization of our Customer Marketing function. Thank you for building strong relationships on this journey - I'm optimistic they will pay dividends throughout FY20 and beyond! With gratitude, -C\n\n73#PUMPED!!! About Partnership ...|Jill, Pam - Thank you for your leadership on our Marketing Calendar Alignment workshop with SLT, CS, and CX Leaders today. This moment mattered today and will pay dividends continuously in FY20. I want to specifically recognize a thoughtful, well-prepared set of meeting materials and discussion guide. It generated a high level of engagement and participation from our partners, and created the basis for a strong go-forward platform for iterating, evolving, and delivering a dynamic Marketing plan that is on strategy, aligned with our sellers' and customers' needs, and explicitly linked to our business goals. It also reflected critical transparency and collaboration dynamics we are building cross-functionally. Thank you, well done, and excited about the momentum we have going. With gratitude, -C\n\n74#Value Based Webinar Events|Thank you Chris & Pam for your partnership to help launch a value based webinar series! We have amazing customers who are getting tremendous value from our solution. Appreciate how you have teamed up with us on shaping and getting this underway.\n\n75#Project Bow Tie|Pam, Jill and Matt, I just wanted to call out the wonderful job you are doing with Project Bow Tie.  Reimagining our demand generation function is daunting.  But you managed Phase 1 so smoothly and we're starting to build some real momentum now.  Not only have you navigated through those ideal customer elements seamlessly, but you have kept all stakeholders well involved, informed and excited.  This type of innovation that brings together cross-functional teams and gets them all pulling in the same direction is a great example for how we will all have to act in the coming years to continue the company's growth and innovation.  We still have a long way to go but well done so far!\n\n76#Trying Something Different!|Amazing demand and field team, wanted to take a moment to say a huge thank you for spending a few hours after a busy holiday season to try something different! Rather than just running through a traditional planning process complete with PPT slides and grids; you all immersed yourselves in something uncommon; roasts and toasts, sticky notes (big and small!) and breaking into teams (outside of your own 'lane') - hackathon style! So happy to see such amazing ideas free-flowing, tremendous collaboration and the willingness to try something completely out of the ordinary and be SUPER engaged during it all. Way to go gang, and so excited to see what 2020 brings for this group of stars!\n\n77#Expert Guides|Thank you for guiding our teams through a fantastic planning session yesterday.  It was engaging, collaborative and fun.  As a result, we were able to ideate and let our creative juices flow.  I was particularly impressed with your approach to the session.  You constantly had the big picture in mind and guided the team to many important discoveries.  Thank you for using this innovative approach and for rallying the team around shared priorities for 2020.\n\n78#Wonder Woman and She Ra have competition!|Jill and Pam- Thank you so much for bringing us together today to share what you learned and walk us through an exercise that will enable us to be more successful as Marketers! Your willingness to share and maintain transparency makes you both GREAT leaders! I know I don’t speak for myself when I say “Thank You” for allowing us to be a part of something amazing! If She Ra and Wonder Woman ever joined force they’d have some serious competition!\n\n79#Cheers to you!!|Pam and Jill - Just wanted to take a moment to TOAST!! to the two of you for an excellent, productive, and super well-run planning meeting yesterday afternoon. The entire team was extremely engaged and collaboration was off the chain. We put our heads together, we were respectful but critical of ourselves, and we came up with some truly innovative ideas that will shape our marketing plans for 2020. I am truly inspired by the teamwork you both showed in leading the meeting together as well. Thanks so much for an excellent afternoon! Looking forward to our top 3 priorities for the year!\n\n80#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n81#Co-creating Great CX is a Team Sport!|Dear Team, I am so grateful to be able to call upon this amazing group of people! You were each willing to invest an entire day to thinking through the customer lens as part of our journey mapping workshop.   To say that I am impressed with the progress we made is an understatement.  We now have 4 draft journey maps - current and dream state for two incredibly important customer types, the End User and Buyer! Thank you for your contribution, energy and excitement about what we are seeking to do and the impact this can have on our business goals!  As we shared, CX is owned by all humans at Workhuman and this team showed so much commitment to CX and excitement around the potential that exists that if this is an indicator of how the rest of the company will feel, it makes me even more excited about how fast we can move our CX from current state to intentional & differentiated!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  You guys ROCK!\n\n82#All of the presentation & communication wisdom|Many thanks to this group for being involved in the development and setup of the Social Media Workshop presentations! This includes advice on format delivery, timing, content, and communication plan. With participation for each workshop between 30-40 people X 9 workshops, we were successful in \"marketing\" our own event.\n\n83#Suggestion box|Pam- Thank you so much for listening to an unorganized, unfiltered team at what was suppose to be a 2020 planning meeting. You took amazing notes, but most importantly, you took action on them. As I left to grab lunch (thank you btw) I saw you meeting with cross functional teams to maximize our efforts as a company. You worked your way down the list over the last 2 days making our challenges a priority. Thanks for making us feel heard and our concerns a priority. You are an amazing manager! Thank you!\n\n84#Vertical Demo's that are sure to WOW!!|Pam, Maureen, Kelli, Brian and Dan – I want to express my gratitude for the work you’re doing on the vertical demo project.  Developing “custom” sites for the major vertical markets we pursue is certainly not an easy task – you need to focus on brand, infrastructure, setting up users, refreshing the system in a systematic way…the list of to-do’s to make this happen is certainly a tall order.  But the outcome to date is awesome and having access to a variety of brands that we can showcase in presentations depending on the customer will help us to highlight the flexibility of our platform and differentiate our offering.  Thank you so much for digging into this project and bringing it to life.\n\n85#Setting expectations|Pam, I wanted to take the time to thank you for setting up two very productive meetings. When looped into the 'mapping moments' project by Alice, you took the time to meet with me to catch up on the work I've done thus far on the project. You set expectations from the start of the meeting, listened to all of my updates, and my pitch for using a digital tool. As we wrapped up the meeting, you helped to set-up a timeline and next steps. I really appreciate all of your guidance, and ability to officiate an incredibly productive and actionable meeting.\n\n86#There's no \"I\" in this team|I am so proud to be a member of this team, everyone was so selfless during my paternity leave. I received so many nice texts to check in on my family and ensure that all of my projects stayed on track. The support didn't stop there, from travelling to Washington to help with TOWL and the West QBR, to shipping out crates, preparing for future events, and sending out communications. Pam, Amanda, Krista and Jill, thank you again for everything that you have done. I truly appreciate it, best team ever!!\n\n87#Internship Program Advocate|Pam - thank you so much for your recent help in getting Marketing managers on board for the 2020 Internship Program!  When you heard that I hadn't received too much internal interest, you quickly sent a note out to the managers in Marketing to advocate for the internship program!  Thank you so much for sharing your success story with them.  Since then, we have definitely received more interest within Marketing!  You're a great Recruiting Partner!\n\n88#Successful Kick-off|Pam - Thank you so much for recently taking the time to kick off your team's newest search, Field Marketing Specialist!  We have kicked off new searches before, but we did it differently this time.  Thank you so much for the deep dive into how this role will fit into your team, the responsibilities, and the interview process.  Thank you for your thoughtful breakdown of what each interviewer will be focusing on.  I cannot wait to find your newest team member.  Thanks, Pam!\n\n89#I understand!|Pam- You always know what to say when you get an email from me that’s lengthy and consists of words like “I feel strongly” or “I can’t control my daggers”. I always feel listened to and heard. We laugh about it the next day and move on to our daily business. I appreciate that I can openly discuss these challenges with you. Thanks for being an awesome mentor! Ps there was no wine used in the making of this moment lol\n\n90#Modernizing demand gen|Jill, Pam, and Matt - I wanted to commend all of your work, passion, and focus around modernizing our demand gen strategy and approach. The three of you have worked diligently over the past couple of months building out the strategy and the how we do it at Workhuman. The meeting with Chris was a great one and it's exactly the type of partnership and future-oriented discussion needed. The marketing world has changed. We have an enormous opportunity to modernize our approach to move from an inquiry model to one that not only targets the right future customers but also drives new demand (and wins at a higher rates due to it being the right opportunity with the right level of investment).  Your efforts make it quite clear how much each of you care about our business opportunity ahead and continuing to elevate how marketing can partner with sales. Thank you!\n\n91#Time is valuable!|Pam - Time is not cheep.  You had a very busy day but you still allowed time for this guy.  I know i ask a lot of crazy questions and but you answered everyone with respect and understanding.  Your knowledge is invaluable to my learning process.  Thank you for your help and teamwork along the way.  It is so appreciated.\n\n92#Takes a village|Team- Took 3 months, numerous meetings and iterations, but we have landed in a great place, with a project we can all be proud of, the new and improved Hello Box! An amazing mentor told me I should be proud of the work I produce and if not proud, to take the time needed to produce excellence...I believe we’ve done that! This is seriously epic and we have all you to thank for that:) So excited to start sending theses Hello Boxes and Folders our to key prospects!! Thank you all for your hard work!!\n\n93#Love the challenge|Pam- You always find ways to challenge me, even if it makes me extremely uncomfortable. There’s even a lesson in that for me...nothing like agreeing to disagree first thing in the morning! I’m lucky to have such a great manager who pushes me out of my comfort zone and encourages me to produce the best work, even if it takes longer than I’d like;)\n\n94#Covering while I was out|Pam and Ryan- Thank you for covering while I was moving into my new house last week! Ryan- you sent out multiple direct mail items and customized messages with little guidance. You worked in a critical presentation with lots and lots of commentary. Pam- You kept the HB on track and moving along so the final product is amazing! Thank you both so much for being amazing!\n\n95#A sweet first day back|Thank you guys so much for keeping me abreast of all the happenings around here while I was out on maternity leave, and for a super sweet first day back in the office. Coming in today to donuts, Night Shift, and pretty flowers on my desk put a huge smile on my face and I really can’t say enough about how much it meant to get a surprise like that on my first day back. Jeff  - I am already so impressed with the great work you are doing and am looking forward to digging into it all with you! Thanks again for a great first day and your help with the transition!\n\n96#Breakout Support|Thanks to you all for helping facilitate the \"Differentiators\" breakout.  Each of you stepped in to support this activity and make it meaningful for your team members.  This year's Boot Camp was truly a team effort and I appreciate your contribution.\n\n97#Putting the Magic on Paper!|Pam, you have been absolutely amazing taking all of the ideas we have tossed around in regards to Demand Gen 2.0 and making them real on paper; from capturing notes, to building out PowerPoint decks. Working with you on this initiative has been my favorite project over the last few months. So excited to share more ideas (and laughs!) over the course of the second half, we got this!\n\n98#A meaningful Pride|Pam - a very overdue thank you for sending a really impactful article about Pride my way at the start of this month. It touched on a really prevalent topic in the corporate world – that companies need to be careful to extend Pride beyond marketing efforts, because it is SO much MORE than that. Your article inspired us to take a closer look at our efforts, and add some really meaningful pieces to our 2019 Pride plan. Thank you!\n\n99#Great Growth Hacking Session|Pam - Great job in bringing in new perspectives and ideas to the Workhuman Cloud for Teams work and more. Your brought in a former colleague of yours - Sean Ellis - for a growth hacking workshop.  While I was only there for the first half, it was a great session!  Our opportunity ahead is incredible - but to truly maximize it, we need to continually challenge our thinking, mindset, and approach (And of course, test, test, test, and test). Training sessions like this one are a great way to do just that.  Excellent work in leveraging your network!\n\n100#Agenda at a Glance|Or, agenda in a moment.  Thanks all for coming up with a great overview of the important projects happening in Marketing, with just a little notice.  It was not only great to hear about the wonderful work happening in Marketing, but to see you all present it all so beautifully.  I am grateful for the talented team of colleagues we have at the helm and in support of all of these initiatives.  Thank you!\n\n101#HIRED!|Pam, congratulations on your newest hire!  This was the first time we had worked together on a search, and boy was it a successful one!  From kick-off, to phone screens, to interviews and feedback sessions.  Thank you for your help and advice along the way.  I am so excited for Mark to be joining your team soon - I am confident that he will do great things!\n\n102#Strategic Experience Mapping Workshops|A big thanks to all of you for coming to the Experience Mapping Workshops ready to share ideas of how we can use WH to help achieve our company goals. It was fantastic to see how aligned everyone is! Your time and dedication will help create the best WH yet with carefully curated experiences that will inspire all attendees and customers. Great job everyone.\n\n103#Social Studies|Oh hey there! I want to take a minute to celebrate how good a group we were at the marketing offsite a few weeks ago. I must admit, we had topic that just about everyone has a lot to say about so that made for great conversation after our presentation. We budgeted our time perfectly, stayed out of rabbit hole conversations, and everyone got to put their expertise into action. Pam you did a great job of organizing and filtering all our thoughts into something actionable and realistic in the time frame for our presentation. Tyler, you're very involved in social media on a day to day basis both generating content and absorbing content. That makes you invaluable when it comes to best practices and current trends/patterns. Roshni, same, but also you worked well with Pam to take all the warm and fuzzies and make it something that can help drive business. Angela, no surprise here, great organizational skills with the group as a whole, keeping us on track with our timeframe and reminding us to eat! Plus your passion for important topics is just what we need in these conversations.  Thanks to all and I think we sparked some very valuable conversations that will manifest into great things to come!\n\n104#Allied BBR|Hi All,  Just wanted to say a massive thank you for all the help (presenting, creating slides) in preparing for Allied's Business Review last week. This was my first one and with all your support you made it a little bit easier.  Much appreciated! Thanks again Thomasina :)\n\n105#Minimally Viable Presentation|MVP TEAM! WOW! What an amazing feat pulling together one of the best narratives we ever had presented at the ELT meeting today! The information flowed, they were wowed, they laughed, it showed our strengths and highlighted our successes. You ALL were integral to making this come to life, especially during the last minute crunch hours (YAY BRUINS!!!) I was so honored to re-pre-sent all that Marketing has been working on what's to come. You are a fantastic group of humans, so grateful to work with you.\n\n106#Persona Workshop Warriors Unite!|I have such a grateful heart for this day, this entire team of Marketing mavens, and all the opportunities that sit within our reach. I have never felt more connected to our team than I do at this very moment. We just completed an all hands, all day persona workshop! Woohoo!!! Thank you for your investment. Thank you for being a kind audience that stayed engaged. Thank you for asking thoughtful questions. Thank you for your humor and your patience. Thank you for being real. Thank you for embracing the 7 1/2 hour marathon persona training session we shared today with gusto and heart! I truly believe that we will be a better team, and we will produce better marketing because of the time we spent together today. I can’t wait to hear your feedback about the agenda, the learning modules, the wiki….ALL the things! I can’t wait to apply this first body of persona work to our marketing efforts. Let’s GOOOOOOO!\n\n107#Gratitudes for our breakout group leaders|Thank you for stepping up to lead the practice area breakout groups today. It was a packed agenda that I tried to choreograph down to the last minute and last detail. I felt completely at ease with the five practice area team presentations because I knew I had awesome leaders guiding the way. The teams were cross functional spanning all areas of our department including some new faces from our PR firm, but in watching everyone interact with each other, you would have thought we worked really closely together for decades. So much collaboration and lively discussion. Insightful presentations....It was a beautiful thing. Thanks again for your leadership.\n\n108#Excellent Exec Readout - WH Live 2019|Hey team, I am so grateful for your professionalism and expertise, so clearly demonstrated in today's WH Live readout to the Exec Team. In many cases, team members dove deep, and you had all the answers because YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF. BAM! Well done, you made me proud!\n\n109#Leader of the Pack|Whelp! We made it through and couldn't have done this without your leadership! Gratitude Bar, Demos, WHCT's, Bookstore, and Registration would have not been done without all of your support! You all took the lead on being a project manager in these roles and put in many hours of training's, staffing, and support on site at the event! Thank you very much for being dedicated leaders and making sure Workhuman 2019 was the best one yet!!!\n\n110#May I Chime In|Thank you so much for your team work and being a room host at our Executive Forum dinner at Husk. From setting up name badges, welcoming guests, ringing those chimes to move guests along, keeping track of time, clearing tables (Ellen), and making sure guests left with everything they came with - your efforts to make this event a success were truly remarkable! Thank you for being part of this team and this event!\n\n111#Quiet leadership|Pam, I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed working with you on this first round of nurture track emails for WHC for Teams. From initial brainstorms to on-the-fly check-ins and back and forth fine-tuning, I so appreciate your positivity, patience, responsiveness, humor, and dedication to getting these right. It’s been such a pleasure and I hope we get to work together more often!\n\n112#WHC4T Goal Achieved!|Pam - congratulations on leading the team (in collaboration with Sales and Product) to achieve our activation goal for the launch of Work Human Cloud for Teams. The results speak for themselves, and the focus and relentless leadership to achieve our target was awesome to see! Well done in hitting this first critical milestone!\n\n113#WHCT Marketing Partnership|We did it !!   Pam - The successful launch of WHCT would not have been possible without your superb leadership, collaboration and support over the last couple of months.   When we first had our SWAT team workshop in Dublin in mid-Nov,  we had a list of questions that was a mile long !    One could have been easily overwhelmed with the sheer magnitude of what we had to get done in a short amount of time. But we worked through the priorities and you put a plan in motion and involved key people from marketing when needed , to execute on this plan.    You demonstrated great leadership in the face of uncertainty and drove us through what it would take to have a successful launch at WH.    I am truly grateful to have you as a colleague and I am so very appreciative of your efforts.   Thank you Pam !   Now onwards and upwards to grow the user base and adoption of WHCT !\n\n114#Workhuman Cloud for Teams Launch|Pam, thank you for your terrific leadership on the WHC4T launch today. You put in place and executed a smart, simple plan that is already showing astonishing results (I don't want to be a spoiler, but the click-through rates on the email to attendees is OFF THE CHARTS and we have excellent momentum toward our goals). Thank you for your determination and consistency, even when things were a little confusing or unclear. We're off to a great start in this new area of future growth, thanks in no small part to the important boost you provided. Thank you!\n\n115#WHC4T Sales and Marketing Leadership|There is nothing like working with a team of people who clearly know their stuff and are willing to go above and beyond to ensure we shine. Anne Marie, it was so clear our marketing programs are in great hands under your stewardship. I was so impressed with your depth of understanding and quick thinking as the project evolved. Jess the attention you paid to the data accuracy was critical to support this complex process. Anthony, you were amazingly calm as deadlines slipped and the versions cycled… and you found ways to ensure we stayed on track. Mark, your perspective was grounded and informed so much of our work and how we rolled it out to sales. This is a great group that I am incredibly grateful to have had this collaboration! And last but far from least, Pam, I couldn’t be more grateful for your leadership and partnership in this launch. With every touchpoint to be considered, you brought your all, and you were an amazing sounding board to me. It was a pleasure learning from you, working alongside you, and getting to know you along the way.\n\n116#Gratitudes Video Killed the Text Reader!!!|I am grateful for ... Pam, James and Matt!!! Thank you, thank you for all your help in creating the Gratitudes video to truly bring to life, with emotion, why expressing gratitude is important, what it means to others and how to get started today! When the Music Television Network MTV (do you young folks even know what that is?) the first video song played was by the Buggers named 'Video Killed the Radio Star.' I believe we're in a new generation of consuming info and our Gratitudes Video will be the 'Video Killed the Text Reader'.    'Pam, your plate was already full and sauce coming over the side then we asked you to create a brief for this video. Your passion for why video and support throughout this whole process has been amazing! It's been so great re-teaming with you. I think the last time we worked together was on our Winning With A Culture of Recognition book tour! The book tour skyrocketed social recognition to new levels like WHCT Gratitudes will for the masses! James and Matt, your willingness to listen to our 'why' and pile on your own vision for this video to be a Yes, and! ... was tremendous. You shared with us other types of creative video styles and how they would work well for this case, too! Then you headed off, read our storyboard, did scene selections from existing and new footage, produced, and added the sound track like Oscar Producers! Your work is so impressive and under the tight deadlines you never even seemed to sweat! I know you had many projects on your plate, Citizens video shoot, other Workhuman commitments and we still felt like your top priority! I'm super grateful for all you did and all you do!! You Rock ... my song for all of you is 'Rock Star' by Nickelback!\n\n117#22 humans = 1 great company meeting|That's right, it took 22 incredible humans coming together, playing various roles to deliver our March company meeting! This cross-functional group pulled together the content, technology, testing, scheduling, and delivery of the messages at the meeting. Thank you for the role you played. I so appreciate the partnership required to make these meetings go so smoothly.\n\n118#Dream Collaborators|I want to thank you all for being such great collaborators.  I feel like whenever I reach out to any of you with questions or concerns, I end up getting a quick, helpful and thoughtful response.  Whether it's collaborating on GForce 20 Panels, the Social Selling initiative or the Persona project, each of you demonstrates teamwork, professionalism and a commitment to quality that is impressive.  I appreciate all your support and look forward to continued collaboration.  Thank you!\n\n119#The big reveal!|It is with great gratitude that I thank this incredible team for coming together to make our name transformation activities come to life! It all started with Maureen, Alana, and Angela - designing and sourcing items for us to share with employees. You were great partners and added to the process with your unique ideas and fun twists! Clare - you've been on top of so many details and ensured all that was being designed could also come to life in time in Dublin, and you made it all happen and made it look easy. Manan, you approached me a few days ago asking if I needed any help with the desk drop and offering your time. Thank you for being proactive and asking - that meant a lot. You led me to ask for more help and I have Pam, Z, Mike, Dillon, Dana, Daisy, and Laury to help for making the evening desk drop and office readiness go so smoothly and quickly. Kristen, thank you for adding to the planning efforts and suggesting a bit more \"flair\" to dress things up for reveal day. Thank you for the many hands and smiles and just incredible support and excitement about this milestone moment. This could not have all been done without your help. Thank you.\n\n120#Growth|Pam- Thank you for allowing me to grow. This past week I learned a couple of things. I learned that even though you may delegate work, you are the owner. That in the end what is produced is representative of you. Thank you for allowing me to grow by owning my work and seeing that just because a box is checked doesn’t mean it was done:)\n\n121#demand 2.0|It's really hard to find the time (never mind the head space) to think beyond the many looming deadlines we are juggling, so I want to thank you both for an invigorating discussion and a great working session this morning to reimagine how we manage demand gen as we grow and evolve. I think it was probably 9 months ago we really began to identify ways we can up our game and work toward a best practices model for demand, and while we have made some progress for sure, it's time to dig in. I love seeing the commitment to excellence combined with a pragmatic approach to improving how we engage with the market and support pipeline acceleration. We are early in the process but this work will help set the company and our team up for the next level of success. Let's keep going!\n\n122#Ready, set, action!|Pam, Thank you for helping out at Eric’s video shoot last week. It was so helpful to have you there to clarify any questions and make sure that everything went smoothly. You always make sure to ask the right questions and pay close attention to all the key details. They video shoot was done in no time and I’m excited to see the finished product. Thank you!\n\n123#Changing the world one meeting at a time|Team, I wanted to pause and celebrate how far we have come in our mission to bring humanity back into the workplace and beyond.  Yes, we do get stuck in the weeds from time to time, however each of these critical questions and discussions has brought us that much closer to a solution that will work in and out of the corporate environment.  We all bring a unique perspective to the table and we all respect each others thoughts and ideas in order to build upon them.  Great work thus far and I look forward to what we will bring to the world as the days, months and years unfold.\n\n124#And we're off!|I just wanted to thank you all for bringing your A-games to Thursday and Friday's Freemium kick-off meetings. Pam - you did a fantastic job educating the team about the product and setting goals and expectations. Jess - the creative groundwork you've done leading up to this is so impressive and I'm sure you will be a driving force of creativity and  inspiration during this entire process...not to mention the meetings leading up to the kickoff when you definitely prepared us all to do our best work!  Maureen - I think the energy and enthusiasm we all saw at the end of Friday's meeting speaks volumes of what you bring to this team, bringing a no holds barred approach to achieving the best website experience we can with a laser focus on achieving our goals. Jay and Tyler - you guys are already presenting game changing ideas for our entire online experience, and I can't wait to see what you come up with as we work together. Geoff - You've been absolutely  killing it on the web team (still shocks me that you just joined!). This one is right up your alley. And finally Angela - You built us a plan, we have a process, and now the team is ready to do our best work!\n\n125#HIRED!|Pam - thank you so much for all the time and effort you put into hiring Holly's contractor coverage. From the start, you knew that this position ultimately would likely not report to you - but you never once hesitated to take on the responsibility of being the point person for this search. You were quick in getting back to me, and in making decisions. You put together a great interview team to evaluate our candidate, and because of you - we have an awesome new contractor starting in the New Year! Thank you so much for your partnership and support. I really look forward to working with you on other searches in the future!\n\n126#Barf buddy|Thank you for appreciating my \"barfs\" and helping put my thoughts into clear direction for the team! As a creative person I'm always full of ideas (sometimes TOO many!) but I need a buddy to help me translate it to the team in an actionable way and you always help me do that! THANK YOU!\n\n127#All signs of a great leader|Pam- Last month during my coaching session you said you needed to make more of an effort bringing our team together. You mentioned next time Jen came to the office, we would all go to dinner. Last night you kept your word and took us all to dinner. Last week you made time for me on the fly because we missed some 1:1s and I needed some guidance, you delivered. I also called you on my ride home from NYC because I felt overwhelmed, you listened. I submitted 2 expense reports and you approved that same day. For someone who is always in meetings- you always make time. Today I learned it was a sign of a great leader, but I already knew that, I hope you do!! Thank you!\n\n128#Social Selling Kickoff Success!|Pam, great job in successfully executing our first social selling program kickoff! You could see the lightbulbs going off all around the room as everyone began to grasp the potential of this new skill-set. We've lots more work to do, but this was a terrific start, and I think everyone is feeling confident that the vendor you selected is an excellent partner to help us get there. Well done!!\n\n129#Marketing Leadership at Work!|Big Team - thank you for all the hard work and homework you put into preparing for the Marketing Offsite. It took weeks of prep, but we plowed through the entire organizational plan AND gave ourselves space for some extraordinarily creative and transformational thinking (who doesn't love THAT? ;-) Thank you for bringing your whole selves and giving your colleagues the gift of your undivided attention. Thank you for your leadership, candor and trust, and thank you for your DECADES AND DECADES of experience, put to work! :-)  As we all know, the real hard work starts now to get us to coherent and aligned 2019 plans, executing against those plans and tackling the big projects we identified. I am so proud to be a part of this team, and I meant what I said: I have NEVER worked with a more engaged group of people in my entire career. I am so excited about what we will accomplish together, and how we will contribute to accelerating Eric's thrilling vision for our company!\n\n130#It takes a village of humans ?|Thank you team WorkHuman for your dedication, sense of urgency, and partnership on the agenda announcement last week. Dianne as always you kept the project moving and made sure we covered all the details up front and when we had last minute changes/edits. Lauren - you are so agile and easy to work with on the many, many, many different copy reqs and I am really happy with how everything came together thanks to your quick responses and thinking on your feet. Dan - thank you for being right there with us and making sure we get approvals on all the copy as well. Sarah - Your blog announcement was spot-on and will be a great piece for us to repurpose in social for the next few weeks as well as on the website! Speaking of website, Brian, thank you for being on top of all things workhuman.com and keeping us abreast of the metrics, goals, and sprints each week and especially as they relate to this campaign. Mike - you are a rock star, simply put! I know that last minute-edits to an email email after it is already in Marketo is not always the easiest ask but, you took that in with a sense of humor and made the finished product look and feel great. Pam - With all you have going on you were able to take time on Thursday morning to be the \"executive approver\" and make sure we got the email out by lunch time while I was working from home and not feeling great, I am so grateful for you! Finally, Jay and James - thank you both for helping to conceptualize and create a truly unique and engaging motion graphic video announcement for social! This was the ask that really could have used more time but, we knew what we had to do and you both took it in stride, and produced a really amazing video that is already seeing high engagement rates on social. THANKS TEAM! ✔️\n\n131#Executive Forum Core Team Commitment|Your commitment to this team and to making these forums a success is what gave me the confidence I needed as I took on the new role of Executive Programs Manager. You attended weekly meetings, helped set the agenda for the forums, managed speaker outreach, details, contracts, presentations, schedules and confirmations. You helped push attendee registrations with our internal teams, shared ideas, brainstormed opportunities, participated in debriefs for improvement and kept the communication flowing every step of the way. Your dedication, support, and enthusiasm was immeasurable and I could not have asked for a better core team for the forums. So let’s do it all over again for Executive Forum Nashville - just bigger and better. Yeehaw!\n\n132#Excellent September All Hands!|Team, thank you so much for your individual and collective efforts to deliver yet another technically flawless, engaging and informative Marketing All Hands. These times we get together to share our progress and connect with one another are so important to our strength as a team. Thank you for bringing your best selves and taking the time to communicate with your colleagues!\n\n133#Great Partners|Thank you each for sharing part of your busy week with the SCD team for our Q3/2019 ideation and planning sessions. Each of you make a huge impact on our work with customers every day and each of you truly understand what it means to partner. We’re so lucky to have partners who share our optimism, vision for growth, and impatience for all of the opportunities we want to close in on! Many thanks for sharing you time and talent in person (!) this week. Sincerely appreciated!\n\n134#Bringing your best game!|Pam, Jill and AMC, I know that a ton of prep went into getting ready for the 2H review earlier this week, and it showed. I am so glad we had the time to prepare and take a hard look at all the good work that has been done and (will be done) for the rest of the year. Your diligence has provided us with clarity, focus and a terrific foundation to build on for 2019 planning. Each of you made a massive contribution in the meeting itself, and you made me very, very proud. Such a strong team - I am so pleased to be a part of it. Well done!\n\n135#So many things...|Pam, you are leading so many key initiatives, it is sometimes hard to know where to start  to recognize all the important contributions you are making that are instrumental in helping the company and the marketing team grow. The social selling initiative is a great example: you identified the need, explored options, developed an approach and found a great partner to help us get up and running. This will be a true partnership with sales, and you are perfectly positioned to make it happen with a keen eye to making sure our teams are aligned. You have also been a key driver behind progress we are making on campaign attribution, defining requirements and partnering with ops to make sure we made a good choice in the tool we have selected. On a completely different front you've also delivered a robust marketing plan for WorkHuman 2019, building off of the success you had last year outlining the strategy that delivered a record audience. Meanwhile you \"day job\" includes leading our entire field and executive marketing team (another capability you created) delivering more than 50 events to engage our prospects and targeted ABM programs to help close a deal, one of the most critical roles in marketing. I'm tired just typing all this! While we work to build out the team and better balance the workload, I so appreciate all you do to innovate and help lead the team to higher ground. Thank you!\n\n136#Great Second half Marketing Review!|Well done team on the second half Marketing review meeting and presentation. What a great meeting and what a great team! There was obviously a huge amount of work that went into the preparation for that presentation and it turned out fantastic. How energizing to see how over the next few quarters we are going to execute on great campaigns, yet keep building new tools and approaches to make us better and better. The future looks modern and agile, yet with a sense of urgency and speed. And we’re upping our game in all things data and attribution related. Great work, looking forward to seeing the fruits of all this work for many quarters to come. Thank you!\n\n137#Plan & Team - Check!|Thank you guys for demonstrating your commitment to Customer Marketing!  You have assembled a great cast of characters to take on a variety of roles to focus and drive our customer marketing efforts!  The very first step was to create a workable plan with associated resources allocated!  Thank you for sharing the plan and team with us this week.  You clearly have been listening to all the feedback we have provided crafted a thoughtful first step!  Now that we have a plan and a team in place, the excitement can begin executing upon that plan.  I am looking forward to all that we can achieve together for the remainder of this year and 2019!  Thank you!\n\n138#A focus on Conversations|While a number of important marketing initiatives have supported Conversations since launch, until recent weeks we haven't had the opportunity or the bandwidth to come together as a team with a cohesive plan to increase awareness, drive demand and better supports the sales and customer success teams. The plan we presented this week is a framework we can build on to better reach the market with a compelling message, and to communicate across marketing and with sales. The planning process got us moving and shines a light on where we need to focus. Thank you all for making the time to contribute with already very full schedules --  a special shout out to Eric B for shepherding the team to get this done!\n\n139#OOO Message in a bottle|Pam/Dillon- Thank you both so much for covering for me while I was OOO! Pam- you played an instrumental role in the HPE microsite/video and the Quicken Loans mobile request. Both had extremely tight turnaround time (days) and were imperative due to an RFP and request from the account. Dillon- Thank you for sitting in on the video shoot, getting all the final details ready for the RS game and getting the HB for a healthcare campaign ready to ship out the door. Couldn’t have done it with you both!! Thank you!\n\n140#Getting it done!|Thanks for being part of the amazing team that came together in 3 days to turnaround a fantastic,  branded recorded demo for mobile . Our prospect requested a recorded demo to showcase the ease of use of our product, and there is nothing easier than our mobile app! Under a tight timeline, you all were instrumental in figuring out how we could create and package a custom mobile demo in under 3 business days. This type of teamwork hits many of our values, I wish I could have picked them all! On behalf of myself and Alex, thanks again for all of your determination, creative thinking and extra effort to get this done.\n\n141#Cross referencing the conference attendee list|Thank you for helping cross reference the attendee list for the conference I attended recently. It was helpful to know which customers I should seek out and say hello to. Ended up making a great connection with the internal comms guy at Dell, and chatted with the Nixon Peabody attendee as well. I'll be downloading some of the presentations shared and will share relevant material with the teams working with others that were part of the conference. Thanks again for  your help!\n\n142#Team attribution for campaign attribution|A shout out for great teamwork between marketing and sales that will improve our ability to advance the sales process and win in the market. Many (many) months back, we sat together to determine a way forward to better understand the ROI of our marketing efforts, account engagement and the prospect journey. We decided the first step was to find the right campaign attribution tool and worked together to understand our priorities and business/technical requirements so we could then educate ourselves about available tools in the market. Everyone brought a unique perspective (that is code for we did not always agree!) but after lots of discovery and debate we've made great decision and the team is unified and excited to go forward. Thank you all for bringing you expertise and passion for doing great work to this project, it made all the difference!\n\n143#Bootcamp Prep!|Hey team, thank you so much for all your time and effort in prepping me to speak to our demand gen/lead gen/social selling/campaign attribution efforts at last weeks' Sales Bootcamp. Feedback was very positive, and it's so great to see the ongoing tight relationship between Marketing and Sales. Looking forward to more great results in 2H and beyond!\n\n144#Respect for Conversations Marketing|Team, you got it done! Thank you for your dedication to the Conversations marketing plan.  We had a tight deadline to from project start to check-in to executive review.  It was easy for each of you to deliver your information because you're so organized.  I appreciate your ability to turn around my requests quickly and provide the necessary detail to build the marketing team's Conversation marketing plan.  Thank you for your quick input and positive response to this project and for living our value of 'Respect for Urgency.'  Great job everyone.\n\n145#Let's DO IT!|Thank you all for taking time out of your busy day to brainstorm ideas on the best approach for winning Nike. James and Michael - You walked us through the entire RFP process to help us understand exactly how our audience will be digesting the information and the best approach for getting the message across to the team in the right area. James ,you even took it a step further and helped draft out a script. Jess and Pam - Your marketing expertise and leadership helped to ensure we were asking the right questions and taking the best approach to stand out against our competitors. I am excited to see the final results. All of you showed true dedication to help ensure this project is a success! Thank you all!\n\n146#Great brainstorm|Pam - I wanted to say thank you for organizing a great brainstorming session earlier this week for WorkHuman 2019 promotional planning. You heard as I did, many of us expressing thoughts and ideas in various meetings leading up to this week and decided to  get us all in a room together to share ideas. The meeting was thoughtfully organized but we still had room to think and collaborate as a team which was wonderful. I am grateful for your leadership and look forward to making some of these ideas come to life!\n\n147#Interview on the fly!|Pam, thank you so much for jumping in and joining a very last minute interview team today! We value your opinion and insight into the marketing/sales collaboration - and greatly appreciate you being so willing to step in this morning to interview our candidate. You are such a team player and ensured a quality candidate experience as the schedule was seamless and your interview of him so well done. Thank you for helping make it a fantastic experience for our candidate and for helping me out in a pinch!\n\n148#Planning Teammates!!!|Pam and Janet, I cannot thank you both enough for your support, brainstorming and endless amounts of time (and meetings!) you dedicated to help get our arms around the demand plan. I very much appreciate the background, support (and patience) while we bounced ideas back and forth. I feel we have something really great as a touchstone and am excited where this will take us for the rest of the fiscal. Appreciate the leadership!!!!\n\n149#Making the time|Pam- Thank you for making the time this week (multiple times) for quick chats (and venting sessions). We role played, you listened while I vented-offering suggestions and feedback. You reviewed presentations, ran through action item lists and continued to do you daily routine of back to back meetings. You are ahhhhhmazing! Thank you!!\n\n150#Interviewing on the fly|Thank you for your last minute support interviewing a great contractor for the financial manager role. With the vacancy looming and the critical nature of the role, you all stepped up to help. You met with the candidate, kept it real in terms of the role, and shined a light on the fabulous Globoforce culture. Thanks to your help, we have a great candidate starting on Wednesday and the team won't feel any pain when it comes to a lack of staffing. Thank you for your support!\n\n151#Meaningful Meeting|Thank you for providing valuable feedback, thoughtful insights and strategic solutions as we debriefed on the WorkHuman Executive Forum and discussed the needs for this audience and C-level involvement moving forward. Your honest input and positive outlook helped to align our thinking as we move into planning for 2019. Leadership is a key theme as we prepare for WorkHuman and is was a key quality exemplified in today's meeting!\n\n152#Bringing WHRI Wizardry to Senior Exec Customers!|In the first initiative of its kind in our industry, you helped the WorkHuman Analytics & Research Institute to bring together a session between leading human capital academics and our top HR executive customers.  Elevating the level of conversations we have with our customers is a company-wide goal.  Getting those executive level conversations  and influence points isn't easy.  And - a two hour long event that included Adam Grant and Shawn Achor was no easy feat to pull off during a WorkHuman that included so many tantalizing choices for those executives.  Thank you all for the parts you played - many of them last-minute!  From Kevin helping to open the door with Adam and Ethan, to Lynette and Rebecca being customer recruiting powerhouses, to Stacey and Pam helping with meeting logistics and making sure the group was taken care of, to Matt pushing a last-minute reminder in the WH app so we didn't lose any of these C-level HR execs, to Greg and Chris for working the room with me and making sure customers felt welcome and that we captured next steps with them.  I've heard tons of great feedback from customers on this session and I know this is the beginning of a successful multi-year initiative for Globoforce!  THANK YOU!!\n\n153#Super G-Force|The G stands for Guidance. Thank you so much for all of your guidance and support over the last too many to count months leading up to WorkHuman and the Executive Forum. Any time I had a question or thought (more questions than thoughts) you were there to listen and help strategize to ensure the best experience for Executive Forum attendees at WorkHuman. You were willing to help in any way possible and make sure nothing slipped through the cracks while also letting me take the reigns and run with it. Your leadership is inspiring and humbling! Thank you so much for helping me to grow in this experience in more ways than you realize.\n\n154#What’s on the Table|Thank you both so much for inviting to be part of the Dinners at WorkHuman this week. Hoops and Hops and the Executive Dinner. It was great experiences to see how they are put together and what goes in to making them happen! Both very different but amazing in their own way!!! Both had unique touches and I was so lucky to be part of it!\n\n155#An incredible crowd of humans- thank you!|Pam, last summer, before I even arrived at Globoforce, you showed tremendous initiative to take on audience acquisition for WH 2018. This was in addition to more than a full-time job and showed me right away your incredible leadership, commitment, and ability to make sure we got this right.This involved orchestrating a complex effort with your (very small) team across a number of tactics including email, social, account-based marketing, and also program design and tools to empower sales and customer success. All of this is of course is HUGE, but as you did in 2017, you also led the charge on targeting the executive forum audience. Incredible results in partnership with sales and customer success-- 2700+ registrations, 300 exec forum-- incredible growth and under budget! What an accomplishment, congratulations and thank you.\n\n156#Pre-WH Recruiting Hustle!|Team - thank you SO much for taking the time to interview our Visual Designer candidate on such short notice.  Everyone was so quick to respond to the request, and so willing to jump onto the interview team.  Also, during the week before WH?  Check.  Honestly, so awesome of you all.  I know how insanely busy this week is for everyone, and you all helped me make this happen.  I SO appreciate this, as it helps us secure great candidates, and create a great candidate experience.  Thank you all so much!!\n\n157#For Customers... and teamwork|You've stepped up to help us rethink customer marketing at a pivotal time as we expand to new markets and targets with WorkHuman Cloud and look to reframe how the market thinks about their total rewards strategy. We are also facing this little task we call WorkHuman followup to gain the most from our investment with customers in Austin. Thank you for your ideas, energy, and initiative —and taking on the challenge in the midst of some of the busiest weeks ever. I'm confident that your experience, leadership, and team orientation will provide tremendous value as we go forward. Most of all I really appreciate your positive attitude! Thank you!\n\n158#2,000 and going strong!|Pam, as we pass a huge WorkHuman milestone-2,000 registrants- it’s a great time to acknowledge all you have done to lead our audience acquisition efforts with great success. While still understaffed last summer you showed tremendous initiative to develop a digital marketing plan, and have worked tirelessly to test, tune and execute. You have also been instrumental, in partnership with sales, to support the personal outreach so important to attracting our audience. And last, but not least, you have led the charge to orchestrate marketing outreach for the Executive Forum, bringing 250+ senior leaders together in Austin. We still have a big final push, but wow- what a tremendous body of work. Thank you!\n\n159#HR Alliance help|Pam, thank you so much for making time to squeeze the HR Alliance organizations interests into the fold.  with WorkHuman so close, you could have punted until next year, so I not only appreciate you addressing the need, but taking on the addition effort as well.  I am looking forward to phase 2 of this project and seeing how we can grow with them.\n\n160#Leadership at its best|Pam, thank you so much for all of your guidance with my ENDLESS questions for the last month! You always have amazing suggestions, are calm under pressure and just an overall great leader! Thanks for being a huge contributor to a great Globoforce experience thus far.\n\n161#Hallmark Card|Pam- 2 years ago you took me onto your team, little did you know what you were in for. Daily I look at the bigger picture, because of you. Strategize because of you. Stop, think and listen (soooo hard for me) because of you. Everyday I want to become better, because of you. I still have so much to learn but I will, because of you. I’m not sure how this ended up sounded like a hallmark card but I’m sure it’s because of you :).\n\n162#Understanding the Importance of Onboarding|Thank you for gathering the Marketing stakeholders together in ensuring we have an effective Marketing onboarding session for our new hires. With the many changes and fast growth of the Marketing org, I appreciate you taking the time in updating your onboarding presentation slides and making sure we tell our Corporate Marketing story the best that we can. Our Onboarding Program is so crucial in setting up our new Globostars for success, so thank you for taking your session so seriously.\n\n163#Positivity in the Chaos|Pam, thank you for always being positive and offering proactive solutions in the face of chaos. No matter what the challenge is, you always have a calm demeanor and contribute valuable insight to overcome an obstacle or improve a campaign. Thanks for being a motivational leader and helping us all grow in our roles.\n\n164#Executive Forum Mailing Mavens|Thanks so much for playing an integral part in getting the Executive Forum video mailers packaged, labeled and sent on time to get in the hands of our prospects and customers before the holiday break. It takes a team to execute a mailing of this size so please know that the positive response already received to the WorkHuman Executive Forum in Austin is due in part to your time and efforts. Many thanks!\n\n165#Treading the Budget Waters!|Pam and Anne Marie, your assistance with the Marketing budget as I work to close it out for the year has been helpful and appreciated! Pam, it started with you recognizing that Terminus is no longer just a trial program. You called a team meeting to help talk through how management, execution, budget, and tracking can move forward best in 2018.  Anne Marie, you took necessary action to assist a budget that was not on track to close for the year. Pam, you helped to execute an initial plan to move this forward. Finally, Anne Marie you helped talk through and strategize how best to manage this. Pam and Anne Marie, your actions and responses to these situations remind me what great leaders you are. Thank you for collaborating and working through this with me.\n\n166#Santa's Little Helpers|Thank you so much for getting mine and Brian's SMB christmas \"Thank You Baskets\" out. I asked and you delivered. True teamwork and our clients are really going to appreciate the extra touch. For the business and references they have continued to give us over the year. Thank you !!!!\n\n167#Leading the way!|Pam, there are so many things this award could cover, and I am not even sure where to begin, but first and foremost thank you for being an excellent colleague, friend and mentor. I love the alignment and strategy we've put in place as a team and your continued support has made it all possible. The team is in a strong position to make great things happen and I look forward to 2018, when we can leverage some great reports to see all the plans and strategies leading to awesome results for the company. You're an awesome leader and I'm lucky to learn from and lean on you! Thanks!\n\n168#Pushing projects forward|Kevin and Pam - thank you for helping me route multiple projects to the right people for approvals over the past few weeks. I appreciate your collaborative efforts with the team to ensure we have the right idea in place to move projects forward and make them as perfect as possible to go out into the world. Support like that truly makes us feel like a team with the same goal. Multiple projects needed a strong push in the right direction and you were a big part of making that happen.\n\n169#'It's all happening!'|Walking out of that fantastic presentation, all I could think of one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite movies of all time, 'It's all happening!' - Almost Famous. You four put together GREAT out-of-the-box ideas that wowed Janet, Kevin and I. Ideas that we are excited to immediately put into production and get out to market! When there are limited boundaries, you all really shine. We can't wait to see it all in action.\n\n170#A-team|I wanted to give a big shout out to this team for getting together regularly so we can tackle challenges and support the whole team as a united front. I've appreciated the frank discussions and ability to share our points of view in a safe environment bent on making things better for everyone. Staying in step with what other parts of the team are facing helps me gain perspective of the bigger picture and set expectations with my own team so that we can offer better support to everyone's priorities. Our meetings make me feel like there isn't anything we can't accomplish!\n\n171#Lead by Example|Pam, Even though you are extremely busy, you took the time to help me get acclimated - from making sure I was invited to the right meetings, to helping me navigate who was who and our processes, to spending time with me to explain \"everything\" I needed to understand. I would not be this far along if you hadn't taken the time to do that. I'm deeply grateful.\n\n172#What a cast of characters you are!|Thank you so much for your starring role in the Conversations video! It was so much fun working with each of you, sharing lots of laughs and serious faces (on camera of course) for our third Globoforce product video. Thanks for playing in our sandbox, you will forever be immortalized as a key to our success!\n\n173#OOO Calendar|Thank you for using the OOO calendar so Angela and I are equipped to schedule meetings and deadlines. It is a small task that makes a big difference in managing your projects; we appreciate it!\n\n174#Encouraging the conversation|Pam- Thank you got encouraging me to have 2 separate uncomfortable conversations last week. You continue to inspire me daily, this time stepping out of my comfort zone. Without your coaching and mentoring, I would have continued to skirt around some frustrating issues. I appreciate the extra push:)\n\n175#Stepping Up With Continual Energy and Drive|Pam and Anne Marie - over the past several weeks and months, there have been countless examples of you stepping up to help our most important initiatives, from campaigns to WorkHuman to so many things in between.  Time and time again, you've somehow found the time and energy to help and make an impact for the team (leveraging your marketing and Globoforce experience along the way).  Thank you for all of your efforts - and helping fill gaps in our mission to make the world more human through the power of social recognition!\n\n176#Initiative & Leadership|Pam, working with you these past couple of months has made it clear to me you are an amazing leader for Globoforce marketing. As we work to fill some open slots you've taken on so many initiatives outside of your \"job description\" -- sometimes requested but more often you see a need for a project or people leadership and make sure it is covered. Most recently you've tackled the development of a complex marketing plan for WorkHuman requiring not only significant marketing skill but insightful perspective on how to integrate the efforts of multiple teams. All this while nurturing new and existing team members who benefit from your leadership and direction. These efforts are so appreciated, you are a great role model for the team!\n\n177#Step up day|And I'm not talking about back-to-school! Thank you for stepping up, locking yourselves in a room and focusing on the Workhuman campaign plan. So many groups to target, nurture, educate, nurture, impress, nurture. Did I mention nurture? I can't wait to see what you've mapped out and to execute on it!\n\n178#Solid Q2|Appreciate all the marketing and field event support for all the territories in Q2. We had Legos, Rubix Cubes, Healthy Boxes, Healthcare, ROI Calculator, CHRO Project, WH Follow-up campaigns just to name a few. In the field we had Peer 150, TopGolf, Chicago Evanta, and I am sure I left off some others. Always multiple campaigns to help make further inroads into the territories and progress into our accounts. You rolled out Digital Marketing with accounts like 3M and look forward to launching DM into those hard the to reach accounts! Solid contributions and support across all regions in Q2 and look forward to the follow up successes from these campaigns in Q3!\n\n179#Final Regroup on Eps|Pam and Angela- Just a quick note to say thank you both for putting together the last minute regroup this morning on the Episodes campaign. We have all been working in our own little spheres on this one for a while and getting the whole gang together to have a final regroup before officially launching was really helpful. I am glad we were able to hop on a call with short notice, get everyone's questions answered, and finalize next steps quickly and efficiently. Honestly, I think that is how all our meetings should be run.... BADA-BING-BADA-BOOM!   Thanks for putting it together, Angela, and Pam, for being our fearless leader!\n\n180#It Takes an Army|Thank you for putting a ton of time and energy into the ROI Calculator campaign. This campaign literally took an army of people to pull it together. It took research, training, integrations, and many design iterations to make it a successful campaign. I can't thank everyone on the ROI calculator team for going above and beyond to make this campaign happen. Now, it can be used in many different formats, outlets, and move deals along!\n\n181#Constant support and inspiration|Pam- You always make yourself available. Two weeks ago, it was emails at 4am because my daughter broke her arm. Last week it was an after hours call to deliver what could have been unsettling news. This week it was a brainstorming session on what value a conference would bring to Sales and GF. Yesterday it was an impromptu question and answer convo, offering support and guidance. You provide constant support and inspiration no matter the time of day. Thank you so much for all that you do. You really are the true meaning of inspiration!\n\n182#E-VIP Team|Pam,  It has been such a pleasure working with you over the past several months to create such a magical experience at Workhuman for our E-VIPs.   Together we created a remarkable event!  The CHROs I chatted with raved about the white glove service and it wouldn't have been possible without you.   Your skills at project management to your help with last minute changes made the CHRO track a unique experience and I look forward to  creating more memorable experiences  together for our Executive Forums.  Regan\n\n183#Making Nate Brown Feel Welcome|Pam and Regan - thank you both so much for going above and beyond to include Nate at the Exec dinner during WH17.  I know you both had so very much going on with the craziness of workhuman yet at the last minute you both dropped everything to make room for Nate at this great event!  He was one of the last to leave the event and we already have a next step planned for two weeks out!  Much appreciated your going above and beyond.\n\n184#WH2017 Executive Track|I wanted to take a minute to say thank you for the amazing job you and your team have done at this year's conference.  You have been my main contact on the Executive Track and your leadership of it has produced simply amazing results.  Last night's dinner by itself was worth the entire investment Globoforce has made in WK.  Being able to connect with the senior most HR people at some of the world's largest company's like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Oracle, NetApp and so many others, will make a difference in our business for years to come.  Thank you for your attention to the details, your partnership with me and the sales team, and thank you for being a great teammate in making the Executive Track something very very special for our prospects. It's an outstanding effort and so appreciated. Finally, I am looking forward to today's roundtable session and I am grateful that we will be together at it.\n\n185#True Partner|Pam - thank you so much for stepping up last week to help with multiple projects. You saw my shoulders sagging a bit with multiple deliverables in a tight timeframe. You asked if I needed help and followed up with resources and your own time. You stepped forward to help with the WorkHuman meet and greets; you offered to create a short-term content calendar to support the post-WH email campaign; and you collaborated with me on our WH strategic content plan to firm up our presentation. It is reassuring to know that you are a true partner, unselfishly giving of your expertise, energy, and time. We're in it to win it, and you are a major marketing force to help get us there.\n\n186#Know I know, and knowing is half the battle|Pam, Dan, & Holly -- What a great presentation you put together to get the whole marketing team informed on your post-WorkHuman ABM/Content Strategy.  You really hit the right notes giving context and background to each element of your plan, and just the right information so we all know what's in store but weren't bogged down in details. I came away feeling smarter about our strategy and more connected to your part of our team -- thanks!\n\n187#Feedback is the Future|Pam, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your suggestions, support, and feedback as we work through the planning of the WH Exec Forum. Your check-ins, ideas, organization, and delegation are greatly appreciated!\n\n188#Never Stopping - Never Even Slowing Down!|Pam!  Your strategic focus on the many, many items you have on your plate for WorkHuman is tremendous!  I am consistently impressed by the sheer number of items you are executing on at any given time.  Your work on the ever changing and expanding Executive Track has been incredibly helpful and I know will impact the event in several positive ways.  And most recently, your work to create and send almost 100 video mailers to our Top 10s and Strategic 25s I know will help us achieve our numbers and will get the right people in seats.  Thank you so much for all you do for WH.  I appreciate all of the creative energy you put into all of your efforts.\n\n189#Thank you!|Pam- Thank you so much for taking time out to chat with me. I struggle with difficult conversations and you were patience as I stumbled to find the right words, listened while I babbled to much around the real challenges at hand and encouraged me to continue to push through it. I can't tell you how incredibly lucky I feel to have you as my manager. Thank you for the continued support through it all.\n\n190#Great Work with Great Place to Work Institute|Pam and Mike - I want to highlight your amazing work with the Great Place to Work Institute - in engineering a fantastic sponsorship arrangement.  I loved your creativity and ingenuity - looking for new ways to partner with them and build the relationship for the long-term.  Not only did your work result in Great Place to Work sending speakers - and prospects - to WorkHuman regional events but it also opened up a speaking slot at their major conference of the year.  These types of opportunities come about when you think big picture - and you have done an awesome job at all levels.\n\n191#Project Athena responses!|Eric, Lynette and Pam. I wanted to say thanks for taking the time to respond to our project Athena questions. As we continue to drive cross-functional awareness and message consistency, your feedback was much appreciated. As a matter of fact, your answers were so good, that we just may keep on obtaining your input! Great job and thanks again!\n\n192#I'm glad we called her!!!|Pam, where to even begin on this one.  I will never forget the look on Higgins and my face as we were working so hard to put together a plan for getting the Project MO list together and the letters out and we were struggling with how to get these in peoples hands and we looked at each other and said, \"we need to call Pam.\"   You started asking us questions about items and details we hadn't even thought of and we just laughed at each other and said \"I'm so glad we called her.\"  You took over everything for getting the letter looking \"Globoforce presentable\" to getting it out the door.  Thank you for everything and we are lucky to have you!\n\n193#Bring it on!|Pam - \"bring it on\" is what I think of when I think about your approach to your job.  That phrase represents your response to any challenge or task that comes up - regardless if it's \"in scope\" of your defined role.  Not only are your always open to new challenges, but you are never intimidated to take on something new, and you are so dependable to deliver results. From selling sponsorships to WH to driving the WH Executive Forums and Regional Forums, your contributions are so valued.  You are such a great team player.\n\n194#WHRF Rockstars!|Today we kicked off the first WHRF in Philadelphia and needless to say, I could not have done it without all of your help and support!  It was a beautiful day in Philly and though the traffic was terrible, everyone left with a smile, some tickets to go back to the museum, or a camera for winning the scavenger hunt. Jen and Lynette did an amazing job delivering the WH and GF message to all our prospects. Erik and Tim drove  awesome registration to the event and flexed their muscles while moving signage and lugging the black crate around. Sarah was my marketing side kick, checking in, stuffing and organizing badges. She even managed getting in a interview with AtlantiCare. Roger, Dave and Chris wooed prospects and customers and Pam made sure all I's were dotted and T's were crossed. A true mentor and amazing manager. She wouldn't leave on Thursday until our crates were shipped and the angry UPS man was long gone. This was a successful event because of all you and I cannot thank you all enough!\n\n195#Sponsor STAR!!|Pam - thank you for securing both IBM and Fitbit to be part of WorkHuman 2017! Their presence will help enhance the overall attendee experience and exemplify a great way to kick off what I bet will be long term partnerships.  I appreciate your innovation in creating packages that were beneficial to both organizations and made it easy for them to take part!  And I look forward to seeing them live in Phoenix!  You are a sponsor STAR!!\n\n196#Achieving Greatness as a Team!|Many times you take for granted family because they are always there for you no matter what. I find myself submitting recognition for all the extended teams and forget what my \"family\" does everyday. Krista- you are always looking to brainstorm, finding new ideas and refreshing the old. Jen- you are always willing to take a second to bounce ideas off of you. Asking all the right questions and leaving some to ponder. Stacey- your attention to detail is impressive! Anytime I need an extra eye (or ear, you are probably regretting taking the cube next to me) I always come to you. Pam- you are our fearless leader. You pull us together and find a way to leverage all of our strengths, challenge us and push us to achieve greatness. I am grateful to call you my globofamily learning from you all daily.\n\n197#Spearheading Sponsorships for WorkHuman|Pam - Fantastic work in getting our first WorkHuman sponsorship - and it being Big Blue!  It certainly was not an easy process.  But through several ups and downs, a yes then a no, you were determined to make it happen.  Getting a sponsorship like this shares many qualities of completing a sales deal - from the pitch to the sell to the close (and bringing in the right people at the right time).  You did great!  In addition to this, you continue to discuss opportunities with other companies that could complement the WorkHuman experience.  Excellent job.\n\n198#ABM at Ignite (X4)|Pam and Dan -  A huge shout out to both of you for a fantastic job with your ABM/Content presentation at Ignite.  For starters, Pam did an outstanding job giving ABM the definition and the context that was needed for everyone to understand how this new strategy will help drive conversion and impact the business.  Dan connected the dots to the content that is so critical to support this strategy.  You both demonstrated an understanding of the business, and the needs of the sales organization.  There was applause (i.e for the new Eaton case study); comments (i.e. \"I now understand what Marketing does\"); and a ton of positive feedback.  Your presentation was engaging as it delivered new ideas, new content and a new structure that is needed to hit the ground running in 2017.  I know how difficult it can be to deliver the presentation 4 times in a row, and you guys were fantastic.  Congrats on a job well done.\n\n199#Truly AWESOME|Pam- Over the last couple of weeks, I have come to you looking for advice and guidance, both work and life related. You are always willing to take 2 seconds out of your day to talk about being a mom, what to stress about and what to let go of. When a daycare mommy blew me and my daughter off for a play date, you told me not to take it personally. When webex is being unresponsive and there are 5 different contacts, you inspire me to be non reactive when I want to give up and find a new vendor. When I come to you looking for strengths during times of weakness you are the spark that guides the way. I couldn't be more grateful and proud to have such an amazing mentor and though I want to be selfish and not share you, I know I speak for the whole team when I say that you are truly awesome!\n\n200#Marketing Hackathon Success|Thank you for making the first-ever Marketing Hackathon such a success! You embodied all our core values and the results were fantastic. The two-week Marketing sprint made us more agile as a team, brought out new ideas empowering every member of the team, and we found new approaches to market – ideas that could impact both our marketing approach and our go-to market for opportunities ahead. There was a buzz and vibe around the office that was felt by all your enthusiasm and accomplishment - all the way up the executive chain. Simply put, YOU ROCKED IT! Jess, Jill, and Kevin\n\n201#It's all about quality|Pam, Thank you for always being there to provide guidance on marketing initiatives.  I appreciate how you're always focused on what we can do to advance our marketing strategies and have the most impact on our prospects. I really appreciate that you never settle for \"status quo\" and always push us to think outside the box, and improve our approaches/thinking.  I really enjoy working with you and look forward to continuing to build out new campaigns together.\n\n202#Go Team!|Pam/Kristen - What a great day!  A big shout out to both of you for planing and executing a fantastic team event for the Marketing offsite last week.  After a few extremely challenging months for the Marketing department,  the extended team was so ready for an opportunity to bond with teammates, collaborate with x-functional team members in a super-fun context, and have a real positive experience with one another to pick up the morale.  You successfully planned an experience that was engaging for everyone and relevant in terms of cross pollinating our different departments to achieve success. It was a great reminder that we are all in this together.  Thank you for your creativity and for driving this to happen.  It couldn't have come at a better time.\n\n203#Simply Amazing|Pam- You're eyes catch things that many miss. You're ideas are inspirational. You take projects up a notch.  Everyday you raise the bar and challenge others to do the same. I can't thank you enough for being such a great mentor!\n\n204#Thank you!|Pam, Thank you so much for all of your help lately to ensure all of my projects are moving along and approved. I have been running a lot of different projects and ideas by you and you have been extremely helpful at providing your advice and expertise so that I can move forward and create successful campaigns. You have been a great leader and mentor and I appreciate all of your help and support. Thank you! Jen\n\n205#Just Getting Started, but Oh, What a Team!|Thank you for your creative, flexible, fast, professional (and fun), teamwork on the account-based marketing plans.  A highlight of my week is our standing meeting, where we collaborate, debate, discuss, and forge ahead on our most important sales & marketing efforts.  Specifically, the Oracle work has been done lightning fast, and we're demonstrating our responsiveness, partnership, and quality with the great work you're all helping to do.  It's such an iterative process!  Sometimes, we have to completely switch directions, mid-stream, and your resilience, cooperation, fortitude and humor make it work.  Let's keep this going!  Thank you!\n\n206#Always thinking on your toes!|Pam- I admire the work you have done with ABM. You have a way with taking a set of ideas and really making them come to life!  Thank you for taking me through the ABM presentation, allowing me to be a part of helping our stakeholders have an impact on their accounts. I'm looking forward to being a part of the team:)\n\n207#Getting it done!|Hey Team -  A big (overdue) THANKS to all of you for your efforts to get the first draft of the Persona/Message Maps done earlier this month.  I know the task was challenging - especially for those of us who are relatively new to GF.  I realize that this task fell outside the scope of what the Demand Center is typically responsible for, and you all embraced it with a sense of purpose.  I was impressed at the amount of research that you all did; the collaborating; sharing of resources; and the dedication to giving it your best shot.  We collectively produced A LOT of really good content that is now under review by Product Marketing.  When all is said and done, this will be an incredibly valuable asset for multiple functions across the company.\n\n208#NY WH Kick Off|Thank you Pam for jumping in and helping with whatever needed to be done for our first event. It was great having you there and to have your support.\n\n209#First WorkHuman Regional Forum|Well that's another first accomplished today as we completed our first WorkHuman regional forum in New York City. There was such a lot of prep work went into organizing these events. I truly appreciate the work you did as a team to ensure the Agenda was the right mix of inspiration and action - that we could deliver a unique experience and still ensure social recognition is front of mind. I believe we achieved that mix. There are things we learn from doing anything for the first time which will strengthen the next events. Great job on shaping the space to be more WorkHuman like and on securing great customers and outside speakers. I'd say we have a nice New York WorkHuman community building. Great job everyone\n\n210#Innovate, Learn, Repeat|Pam - Just wanted to give you a quick shot out on the Oracle program! It's been a learning experience for both of us working on this uniquely targeted effort and I think you've done a fabulous job leading it. From planning out the timeline of touch points and deliverables, to explaining the very unique message we needed to send, you always made sure I understood your vision and where we needed to go. I can certainly say I have never worked on a campaign quite like this and it has taught me so much in the few weeks I've spent supporting your effort. Thank you for your leadership, collaboration, and dedication. Very glad to be a part of it.\n\n211#Great work with IBM|Pam and Jen, thank you for organizing and managing an extremely productive marketing meeting with two very influential marketers from IBM.  I appreciate the attention to detail on logistics and meeting agenda as well as your work in putting together our first WorkHuman partnership prospectus. I am very confident we came away with a concrete plan and that we left them motivated to take action. Thank you\n\n212#Sizzling Summer Series|The WorkHuman summer series agenda is hot!! Great work in bringing all components and feedback together to create an agenda true to WorkHuman and focused on action. Thank you for working together so collaboratively to make this happen - I look forward to seeing how it continues to grow ..... And how it drives registrations and pipeline!!\n\n213#Shifting focus with ABM|Pam - just a quick note to thank you for your enthusiasm, determination and drive to get your head around Account Based Marketing - what it means, understanding of best practices and how we can use the ABM principles to drive revenue. I look forward to reviewing your final plan and to putting it into action.\n\n214#Brains with Budgeting!|Pam -  Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with me regarding the Customer Marketing budget.  Your insight into the types of activities and items that were funded in the past helped me to gain a better understanding of how to allocate the current budget so I can execute exciting new programs for our customers.  I really appreciate your help!\n\n215#CHRO/ Evanta Dinner!|This was my 2nd Evanta dinner.  This event was amazing!  The speakers were on target with compelling messages and the audience was on target.  I appreciate your hard work in leveraging this relationship and working so hard to pull off another super successful CHRO Evanta dinner.  Your the best!!\n\n216#Evanta @WorkHuman|Pam, Thank you for all the work you did in organizing and executing the Evanta CHRO dinner at WorkHuman. Your worked tirelessly before the event on the agenda, logistics, attendees, food and beverage and all round attendee experience. On the night you were the perfect host ensuring everyone had what they need. This was new to our WorkHuman program this year and brought us 37 new CHRO's. Thanks for making it happen! You are WorkHuman\n\n217#More than Vanilla|Pam- Thank you so much for adding your expertise and finishing touches to every email, digital piece, direct mailer, presentation, the list goes on! Everything could be \"vanilla\" but you take it up a notch by adding the extra special flare that separate GF from our competitors. You are always thinking on your toes and digging deeper, so very lucky to be learning from the best!!\n\n218#QBR Success!|Thank you all for your involvement in our Eastern QBR last week!   Your presence and participation helped gear me and our entire team for success this quarter!    We all walked away with some solid action items that will contribute to our success this quarter!  We will win TOGETHER as a Team!\n\n219#Thanks for Providing Valuable Insight & Reporting!|I wanted to take a moment and thank all of you for the significant effort you put into the QBR this week. This reporting required a lot of effort when it came to running reports, comparing metrics, investigating standards and best practices and analyzing results. Your work was incredibly valuable for the team to understand how and what they do day to day aligns to the larger picture of the company's goals. This meeting was informative and resulted in great discussions due to the hard work put in by each of you. Thanks for your commitment to excellence in marketing!\n\n220#Pilot Onboarding Program Teamwork!|THANK YOU so much for being such a tremendous value-add to our new Onboarding Program this week. We had a group of new hires who started this week, and you made their orientation so welcoming, informative, and fun.

I admire and appreciate your commitment and respect to our new program, as it helps in making Globoforce an even better place to work! Thanks a million for your participation and efforts.\n\n221#The Fellowship of SMB|All,  I wanted to thank everyone for their time and effort today as we discussed what we can be doing more effectively in driving awareness for Globoforce in the SMB Market.  Everyone came with passion, energy and excitement about the possibilities that lay ahead for us.  I loved everyone's fresh perspective, and the ideas discussed have given us all great next steps.  This is the type of thought leadership and teamwork I love about Globoforce, all teams and roles coming together to make the most of an opportunity.  I am excited to partner with you all on this as we move forward!  Thanks!\n\n222#Campaign Success|Pam - Congrats on the excellent job you did planning and executing the first phase of the fully integrated Employee Appreciation Day marketing campaign.  Like many recent initiatives, you did not have a lot of runway getting this launched.  However, despite the short timeframe you pulled together many cross-functional stakeholder and lead the virtual team to execute an outstanding example of a multi-touch; multi-media campaign that included media coverage, webinars, emails, blogs, digital ads, newsletter..and more. Early indicators are showing fantastic results.  Kudos to you and the team. I can't wait to see what Phase II has in store.\n\n223#Teamwork!|Anthony, Sarah and Pam,   What a great team we have! Thank you so much for being the main point of contact for the activities I had going on while I was away on vacation. You kept it all going!  Thank you!!\n\n224#Guidance|Thank you Pam for the guidance and mentoring throughout the EAD Campaign and over the last 2 weeks. There was a lot of hard work that went into this campaign and we could not have done it without your leadership! I am so excited to be part of the team:)\n\n225#I have the best team ever!|Kevin, Jess, Pam, Jill, Sarah, Megan -- I wanted to thank each and every one of you for the incredible reminder you collectively gave to me yesterday, which is, how blessed I am to work with the team that surrounds me at Globoforce.  You each reorganized your busy day to lend your helping hands when I needed them the most, and I can't even begin to tell you how much I appreciated that yesterday.  Thank you.\n\n226#Power to the process|Just wanted to give  a shout out about that awesome process meeting! No one loves a meeting about process, but it was great to get in a room and figure out the best way to make the process work for everyone. We will all learn to be Workfront warriors together and streamline these jobs so we can all focus on what we're good at, and stop spending so much time on how we do it. Thanks so much for your brains and your commitment!\n\n227#Leading the way!|Pam - I want to take this moment to acknowledge and highlight just a few of your accomplishments in the short time that I've been here, that are already having a big impact. You structured a field marketing team with new objectives of marketing and sales alignment; you hired a new field marketing manager who hit the ground running and is killing it; you hired a Global Programs Manager who will be starting on 2/22; you launched a new Field Advisory Board to improve the communications and alignment with the field; you mentored a few members of the team to step outside of their comfort zone in the spirit of their own development; and you have been a real team player by taking on tasks outside of your day to day scope of work.  Thanks for demonstrating leadership, and for your commitment to the team.\n\n228#An idea comes to life!|Ladies, A quick thank you very much for all having a hand in getting a big book mailing out the door in a very quick turnaround ! It simply started with an idea and sitting with you- Pam- to share the vision that John and I had to highlight our success in the pharma market as an insert to go into the book. You took the idea and ran with it. Carrie-the design was just perfect and impactful, and Sara, thank you very much for getting the 50  books out the door immediately, as there was need for them to hit their desks fast! Great teamwork with just an idea. Thank you for making this idea come to life! enjoy! Allison & John\n\n229#Interview Efforts|Thanks Pam, Laura and Julie for taking the time out of your busy schedules to help interview candidates for our creative this week.

THANK YOU! THANK YOU!   Thanks for taking the time to put detailed information as a brief into our WorkFront template making it so easy for the team to access details and truly understand the campaign rollout from beginning to end! I also appreciate the time you put into the PPT presentation you created to help both content and creative understand the ask and the expectations in front of them. Taking the time to walk through this in person was just an added bonus!\n\n231#Inspiring Presenters|Thank you to all of you - each fabulous presenting at Ignite! Thank you for working with me & the Ignite team to ensure you had a phenomenal presentation - including working back and forth with the creative team, IT, and copious dry runs. You were all truly fantastic & I'm sure the survey results will speak to the fact that we had the best Ignite ever. All of your hard work went into making this the best kickoff to date. Thank you for working with me & ensuring your presentation would be top quality work! Kudos!\n\n232#Marketing and Sales alignment....x4!|Holy Cow!!!  Four back-to-back presentations...need I say anymore?  Thanks so much for a great joint effort in getting the job done.  Your content for the presentation was relevant and informative and chock full of great detail.  Everyone seemed to be really engaged and excited to learn about all of our demand gen plans.  You definitely \"know your stuff\" and have a tremendous amount of knowledge to share.  It was great to co-present with you.  A true demonstration of teamwork.  There's got to be a better way....:-)\n\n233#So much to do, so little time|Just wanted to say a big thanks to you for not only helping with my on-boarding during this crazy time,  but also for demonstrating determination to get so many new deliverables done in such a tight time frame for Ignite.  Our Ignite presentation, the Campaign Framework, the Content Mapping, the work with Impressions are just a few worth mentioning.  Your positive attitude goes a long way.\n\n234#Building Something Special at the SHRM Summit|Pam and Mike - Great job at the SHRM Foundation/Volunteer Leaders Summit in Washington DC.  As you know, it represents a tremendous opportunity for our thought leadership, sales, speaking, and WorkHuman - a new \"hybrid\" model.  It was great to team with you on-site to connect with as many chapter presidents as possible and start building the relationships that can lead to more opportunities and expand our reach, awareness, education.  Thank you!  Kevin\n\n235#It took a village|I am so proud to work with such a collaborative team. Even while I was there to accept the award for the B2B Integrated Campaign award at IHAF, you were all in my heart and mind as it truly takes a village to pull off a campaign of this magnitude. My sincerest thanks and gratitude for your hard work and contribution, large or small, on the Service Timelines marketing campaign. Writing content, web development, design, project management, vendor relations, invoicing, press, social media, operations, email marketing, pre-roll, video editing, media buying, tracking, sales enablement, the video mailer…it was a HUGE endeavor for all of us and brought our team together to show that we can take a small idea and blow it out into an award winning campaign. Here’s to many more, thank you for being such a great team.\n\n236#Hey Partner!|Pam,  The entire Inside Sales Team loved that you looked for our input and feedback on an upcoming Marketing Campaign.  As everyone knows, different people want different things when it comes to things like this.  Thank you for looking to the Inside Team to give them the opportunity to take a look at a few pieces you were looking at sending out to see which ones we felt would have the most impact.   The team feels like a true part of this process and we are all eager to see the results.  Thanks for being such a great partner!\n\n237#Great work behind the scenes|Pam Every day I am thrilled to see people on our team being recognized for the great work they do in supporting others members of our company. Many of the activities we work on are very visible to other teams and deserve recognition. However - our marketing programs, events and campaigns would never be successful without the direction and guidance you give your team. The work you are doing right now to build objectives, processes and hire new members of the team are critical for our future success. So while it may not be visible to everyone it is such important work. I see you driving hard each day and am impressed at the workload you are managing. You have a great ability to prioritize and get things done. Keep up the great work\n\n238#Fast track team|I just wanted to give you guys a big thanks for jumping on the GPTW/WorkHuman invitation! We got down to the wire but made our deadline because you were all able to make this job a priority and bring your A-game when we really needed it. Thanks for jumping on it–I think it will be a great asset to help promote WorkHuman at the GPTW event as well as give us a structure to build on as we get more info about WorkHuman 2016!\n\n239#Inspired, insightful collaboration|Jess, Pam and Kevin: I want to thank the three of you for collaborating to build the Marketing Department offsite agenda.  You took your personal understanding of the team's needs for information and inspiration and modeled an agenda that served both needs beautifully.  Our team is more engaged, more aligned in our thinking and more inspired in our vision as a result of the agenda you three created, and from all of us, I thank you.\n\n240#Marketing Team Takes Newport|Thank you for organizing an offsite that was thoughtful, well structured, and also lots of fun! I can't wait to see how the insights and stories we take away from our time in Newport will continue to shape not only WorkHuman, but our Globoforce marketing initiatives as a whole. After the past few days, I think our \"elevator pitch\" has come a long way, and personally, I feel as though I have a much better understanding of sales and product and their unique contributions to Globoforce, which will hopefully start to open the door to more conversations and discussions around how we can all continue to successfully support one another. Very well done!\n\n241#Valuing our buyers|Thank you for inviting me to join your team's offsite to present and share insights about our buyers. I appreciated the team's questions and interests and hope the discussion stimulated some new thoughts. Thanks again for the partnership!\n\n242#Amazing results on the latest WorkHuman video|Thank you for the brand stewardship, content marketing, video direction and group teamwork that went into creating our latest WorkHuman video asset focused on the connection between WorkHuman and recognition.  This video brings the power of working human to life, and so clearly positions recognition as the best first step to get there.  I included this video in my Board meeting presentation last week in Ireland, and it got rave reviews.  Thank you!\n\n243#WorkHuman Workshop!|Pam, Thank you so much for jumping onto a call at such short notice with Macy's around the WorkHuman Workshop.  You were extremely knowledge and insightful about the potential for us to come on-site to discuss these initiatives with a key prospect, and everyone on the call was engaged.  Thank you again, and I cannot wait to see what comes out of it!\n\n244#Piloting the SMB Plane|Pam, you did a fantastic job coordinating the launch of the post WorkHuman SMB pilot program. There were a lot of moving parts to this pilot launch (product, marketing, legal, finance, sales) that you seamlessly brought together to ensure that the WorkHuman mojo continues. Your attention to detail has created the highest quality of work and because of that I'm proud to have contributed to this pilot launch. Excellent work!\n\n245#Award Winning Teamwork|Thank you ladies so much for taking time at the last minute to pull together all the final assets for me for our IHAF submission. With WorkHuman and SHRM and all the other craziness happening at the same time, it's a miracle we've been able to get together so many amazing things to submit. We're almost over the finish line, and I can't wait to see how everything turns out! Thank you!!!\n\n246#Post Work Human|With all the excitement and great ideas coming off Work Human, you have done such a great job sorting through all of it and creating  an actionable plan. Your attention to the details, although not the most glamorous, is very much appreciated.\n\n247#Books Signings|Hi Pam,  Thank you for flagging the need to have books signed for our clients that could not make it at WorkHuman. And for texting me to remind me before it started. Really appreciated that. We got it done. You are the best!  Thanks again, Kerry\n\n248#WorkHuman Customer Experience - A Team Effort!|Wow!

Thank you!\n\n249#Dream Team|If I could wrap all 5 Awards into one recognition I would, but since I cant I choose teamwork. We began this WorkHuman journey together 6 months ago and the results of everyone's hard work, perseverance, dedication, passion and commitment was evident leading up to the conference and definitely throughout the conference. The conference was the most visually appealing I have ever been to. Our content and program was powerful and motivational, our social media outreach was phenomenal, Workhuman central was interactive and provided great networking opportunities. The onsite teamwork shown by the blue team, registration team and all of our greeters was very personal and friendly. I couldn't have been more proud to have such a great group of humans to take this journey with. Thank you to all for making this truly a dream team for me.\n\n250#Reserver Super Star|Hi Pam,  I just want to thank you for all of your help at WorkHuman!  You were always there to help Eric and I get us anything we needed.

In my entire career I have never been so proud to work with such an incredible team!  Thank you for all you do and going above and beyond for both Eric and I.\n\n251#Marketing Magic at Workhuman|The conference speaks for itself.  Well done!\n\n252#Stepping up on a moments notice!|Pam I can't thank you enough for jumping in with Bank of America with literally a moments notice.  Asking you to engage them about the upcoming Boston Evanta CHRO conference.  What I thought would be a 5 minute conversation, you engaged them for 20 minutes.  You then proceeded to take time away from dinner to construct a detailed email of the conversation and strategy on next steps.  Feeling like they would be \"overwhelmed\" by Globoforce, you proved them wrong helping bring their guard down.  Your a true team player and I appreciate your sense of Urgency to help \"on a moments notice\".\n\n253#Leadership starts here!|Pam, this was a tough week for me as we wrap up projects leading up to WorkHuman and I nervously anticipate what’s next. You are the calm leader, able to help me focus and prioritize my scattered list of to-dos. Even when you don’t have all the answers, you find a way to help me sort things out, step back and focus on the now. Thank you for your leadership and for the wisdom that couldn't have come at a better time.\n\n254#Team work and Onboarding|Hi Pam, I wanted to thank you for helping me gather all the on boarding documentation we have from different areas so I could be prepared to support Marion. We are all being pulled in a million directions and I wanted to thank you for taking time out of your day to be a one stop shop for me. It will help me get Marion up to speed quickly and for that, we both thank you! Anne Marie\n\n255#Collaborative leadership at its best!|Jess, Kevin and Pam, I want to thank the three of you for your continued collaborative leadership - for all things WorkHuman and for all the many OTHER marketing plans, projects and priorities simultaneously swirling around us. The three of you together bring a leadership \"bench\" of strategy, strength and success to Globoforce Marketing every day, and everything we do is better for your involvement in it. Thank you!\n\n256#You make me look good! :)|Pam, thank you so much for helping with my my projects while I was away this past week. You quickly took care of one of our vendor contracts that had been held up for quite some time and saved me in the process. I also appreciate you taking the time to review additional WorkHuman campaigns that needed a second eye and timely management. Thank you for making me look good! Mariana\n\n257#Living our Values|Jess, Kevin and Pam, Thank you so much for your enthusiasm, insights and partnership to brainstorm how our Marketing team can better embrace our \"WorkHuman\" values in our day-to-day lives at work.  I am so proud to lead a team who care as much about this as I do.  Thank you!\n\n258#Marketing Support|Thank you for the support on the recent UK networking event.  I appreciate the help you provided with the invitation list, the contract with the hotel and the gift bags.  This was a great first event and I look forward to working with you in the future on others, thanks again.\n\n259#For the SuperHuman WorkHuman Team|To the fearless and fantastic WorkHuman team,  Thank you, thank you, thank you one and all, for the superhuman efforts you have demonstrated to launch WorkHuman.    The event agenda is positively inspiring, the microsite is flawless, and the promotional campaign is first class.    The behind-the-scenes work required for this launch has been epic, but you have all risen to the challenge, brought your A game, and collaborated to create something truly exceptional.    The weeks ahead will continue to demand this level of individual talent, dogged determination, and energetic collaboration, and I have no doubt that this team will continue to deliver on all fronts.    This is what it’s all about: \"building a work culture that reminds us of our worth as individuals that pulls us together in pursuit of shared goals….\"  Team, you ARE WorkHuman.  Thank you.\n\n260#Beautiful Thomas Cook Info Graphic PDF|Thanks for making time from your busy schedule to use the data supplied by CK and produce a beautiful one page PDF document to show how real emotional recognition moments are being seen within their recognition program. This is the kind of real value that Globoforce brings to their program that I am sure TC's key stakeholders will also see!\n\n261#True partnership!|Pam, thank you so much for your help these past few weeks helping me prioritize and keep track of our numerous media campaigns for Power of Thanks and WorkHuman.

I truly appreciate all you do and it has been a pleasure to be in your team!\n\n262#Help Gathering Images for Ignite!|I just wanted to say THANK YOU for the help you gave me in my search for images for various presentations and videos over the past two weeks. So many of our assets are scattered around and it is difficult trying to search when things are being rushed. You all were on top of everything I needed about as quickly as a I asked for it and it was so very helpful knowing i could depend on each and every one of you to help further the work I was doing on my various projects. I am proud to say we are on the same team!\n\n263#Power of Thanks! Thank you!|Jess, Pam and Darcy, I wanted to take a moment to recognize the enormous contribution you have made, leading the book project to it’s exciting publication next month. As Mike Elliot of JetBlue says, \"The Power of Thanks isn't just a book.  It's a greater movement driven by social recognition to show your people how truly important they are to the mission of a company.” From the early writing sessions, the endless drafts, the rereading and editing, artwork, endorsements and endless approvals! As I’ve said before, it takes a village to raise a book, and you’ve been a key part of that and delivered a truly outstanding piece of work. This book will form the foundation for so much of our sales and marketing efforts this year, but will also inspire and educate all those HR people who read it.  It is our manifesto of what is important and best practice with regards to Social Recognition programs. It will help mature and energise the market itself.  Well done and thank you for all your work on this important project. You did an awesome job!  Derek and Eric\n\n264#NY Customer Event Success|Pam and Jenn, thanks so much for all of your help in the planning and execution of the inaugural NY area customer network event. Your support with the location, invitations, planning, logistics, and gifts was much appreciated. In addition to all of the behind the scenes support, it was great to have Pam attend the actual event and engage face to face with our clients. We now have a strong foundation for ongoing NY area customer events in the coming year. Thanks!\n\n265#The Power of Partnership and Great Colleagues|Lynette and Pam - I'd like to thank you for your partnership on the book project.  As you well know, it's a long journey - filled with pivots, new ideas, new edits and changes, and a ton of deliverables.  You have been fantastic partners the whole time - always willing to do whatever it took so we deliver a world-class product. The end result is simply a great book - that the world will soon see!    Kevin\n\n266#It takes a village....|It takes a village to conceive, design, promote, execute and showcase a mammoth undertaking like our Service Timelines experiential booth presence at HR Tech in Vegas.  But thanks to the extraordinary dedication, talent and collaboration of EVERYONE on this award list, we successfully delivered on our goal: We engaged prospects, influencers, analysts and press on the depth and breadth of our Service Timelines offering at HR Tech.

Thanks for being a great colleague.\n\n268#Leadership on Service Timelines Campaign|Pam, fantastic job on the Service Timelines campaign. We've never done something this large, this ambitious, and with this many moving parts. It's all very exciting, but we couldn't do it right without your leadership and passion to get it done! It's such a joy watching you lead our troops and move fast - the quick offsite last week, the media plan, the coordination of messaging, you've gotten s*&%t done.

Great work!\n\n297#Flawless Execution of Branding Package & Demo|From the client's mouth, upon sharing the branding elements and demonstration, \"This is like you stole my secret journal!\"      I ended the meeting immediately, having accomplished our initial goal.  Your posters, banners, postcards, home-page, awards page, theme, program name, and client-specific content, were all SPOT ON!

This booth has been all hands on deck and will be such a success against our competition! Great work!!\n\n299#Inspiring teamwork on infographic|We often talk about being \"inspired\" to recognize.

Quite simply, it was a great scene to watch and see unfold.  The final product is likely to be remarkable.  Great job!!\n\n300#NOLA video project|Pam, fantastic job project managing so many of our most strategic projects! This one was particularly thorny since it involved so many issues- the Engage event, 10 clients, video crews, and the direct involvement of one nerdy and detail-oriented marketing executive! Well done!\n\n301#Ironing out the Nitty Gritty|I couldn’t be more excited to work so closely with you to develop what is our pre-sale packages into a real program. Yesterday, you took the reins and were willing to help resolve all of our requests.

Thank you for all you do.\n\n303#Standing in for Breakdown|Thank you both for volunteering to stand in on my behalf for breakdown of the booth assets after the expo hall closed.  This gave me the ability to leave the show floor and get to the next venue and set up for the Book Launch Party.  I can't do it all alone and I always appreciate when people step up and show the meaning of TEAMWORK!\n\n304#Amazing launch!|Pam, now that the book launch is underway, it's truly impressive to see all of your hard work in action. Behind the scenes you have designed the launch and drove a compressive marketing plan that will take the industry by storm. The new Web site, the advertising, the plan to get the HR thought leaders included in the plan. Your direct relationships with our publisher no doubt will make the book successful too. Great work!\n\n305#Book Launch|Pam, you are doing a fantastic job as team leader for the book launch! From managing deadlines and keeping us on track we have yet to miss a deadline for this campaign!

It certainly isn't easy - but you recognize how important it is (keeping our eyes on the \"prize\").  Thanks for your leadership!\n\n307#Finding Books for Flex Leadership Summit|Pam and Kim, I can't thank you both enough for the rapid turn on an outrageous request for 300(!) Winning books to be shipped fast to Flextronics. We're just at the beginning stages of change management and implementation with this \"Elephant\" client, and were lucky enough to be invited at the last minute to participate with a booth at their Executive Leadership Summit. Thanks to your help, we'll be able to make strategic recognition come alive (and become a priority) for every single executive leader at Flex from around the world. THANK YOU!\n\n308#Exec updates|Gang, thanks for helping me with updates on win/loss, press coverage and the marketing plan for the book. There's a lot going on this week with both the exec offsite and the Board meeting. It's great to know you have my back! When I see the plans and results, it always reminds me how lucky we all are to have you on the team - and the results you generate!\n\n309#Pushing the envelope for marketing the book|Although we aren't experts in Marketing Books, you'd never know it! This past week you have taken such initiative researching and presenting topical and fresh ideas for marketing the new book. You've given us many options to choose from, many of which we didn't even know were out there. Great job keeping us current and up to date every day.\n\n310#A wealth of info!|You have been such an invaluable source of info in my early days/weeks!\n\n311#Incredible Project Leader|Pam, since you came on board as part of the creative team you have been such a great asset to our team!

I'd like to add a new one to the mix, due to the fantastic work of Pam.  Project energizer.  You have brought new ideas, fresh perspective, and great energy to many recent projects, especially the upcoming book.  It's because of your efforts and passion that these projects will have higher levels of success.  Thank you!\n\n314#Patience and teamwork!|Pam, I knew I would learn a lot from you when we met, but I had no idea we’d be working so closely my first two weeks of being hired and how instrumental you’d become on my onboarding process. If I've come up to speed quickly, it’s because you have made it a priority to be available to me and help me get there. I appreciate your effort to go above and beyond to help me hit the ground running quickly and making me feel part of the team. Thank you!!\n\n315#Budget prowess|Thank you so much for your articulate analysis of the Creative budgeting for 2013. You make your spreadsheets all seem so effortless, but I can only imagine how difficult it is to dig through all the data and capture it in a concise and legible fashion. We are well poised this year, thank you for all you've done.\n\n316#Laser-like focus|One of your greatest strengths is your ability to focus on any project that is handed to you. You dive into each with gusto and positivity, even with multiple moving parts and things changing on the fly. You've only been on our team a few weeks now but your skills are crucial to our success, moving forward in the right direction. I don't know how we managed without you!\n\n317#Great work launching Recognition Grader!|Pam, fantastic work on seeing Recognition Grader through to launch!  This required significant cross-team coordination, not to mention incredible persistence as this project was a big, slow-mover that endured several pauses when other priorities took over.  This will be a great resource that we can leverage from a marketing standpoint, as well as in one-off sales situations.  I’m excited this is now live and expect great results from it.  Well done!\n\n318#Another huge webinar success|Pam,    Sometimes big things can happen kind of quietly, so I wanted to make sure you realized how much these things count.

Thank you.\n\n319#Marketo Spec Sheet!|Pam, Thanks so much for taking the extra time to create the marketo email template spec sheet.

The additional help you lent when needed was greatly appreciated by me as well!\n\n322#Handling it all: special projects and campaigns!|Pam, terrific job in Q3 juggling both the special projects that you took on, as well as your normal campaign management.
