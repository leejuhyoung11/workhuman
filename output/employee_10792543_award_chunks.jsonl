"0#thank you|thanks for always being a sounding board, always being happy to jump into a meeting- a call- or a brainstorm. This is a consistent quality throughout the year but especially as of late- you make it easy to partner together and it is appreciated!\n\n1#meaningful mentoring|Amy thank you for being my mentor. It is amazing having the opportunity to share and learn from you. Thank you for giving up your time to this. The coolest thing is,  your words follow me around long after our conversation ends .\n\n2#Team Development, thank you!|Amy and MJ- this note is long overdue, but I wanted to take a moment to thank you both for the DiSC sessions.  Amy, thank you for arranging these sessions for the team— these sorts of things are so impactful for everyone’s development and have opened a lot of interesting conversations on my team.  MJ, a huge thank you to you for leading not one, but two engaging sessions—one for the team and one for the leadership group I attended separately. Your ability to spark meaningful conversations, and make it all so relatable is a gift.  I think I’ve officially become “that person” who can’t stop talking about my High C.......  Thank you both for making these sessions so impactful and for all the work you do to help us grow as individuals and as a team.\n\n3#CCMA Awards...It certainly took a village :)|In Q4 2022, we embarked on a journey to transform our Quality Program though procuring and implementing CallMiner's conversation analytics tool within CS.   This took an enormous amount of effort from a dedicated bunch of humans who not only accepted the challenge but stepped up to learn new coding skills, beta tested with super users, changed how they did their day job, gave up their time to learn how to perform Quality Audits, automated Quality Audits, organized a successful on-site event, hours of copy writing and most importantly resulted in a phenomenal improvement to CS Quality that cements our premium service offering for our customers.  To me, it is no surprise to me that CCMA commended Workhuman for “The Best Use of Technology – Tactical Project” at the 2024 CCMA Awards and I can’t thank this group enough for all the great work you did to make this happen. You should be extremely proud of your contribution, and I am grateful to work with such dedicated professionals. Thank you!\n\n4#Making Women & Allies Mentorship Pilot a Success!|Thank you all for participating in our first ever Women & Allies mentorship pilot program! Getting a mentorship program up and running has been a long-terms goal for W&A and your active participation, dedication, and enthusiasm have made it not only a reality, but a resounding success.

Thank you again for sharing your knowledge and expertise as well as your openness to learning and being a part of a brand new initiative!\n\n5#Analysts Uncovered|Thank you both for taking the time to deliver such a well prepared, informational, presentation on analysts and our relationship with them as a company. They will be an important part of 2025 so everyone having a good understanding is essential.\n\n6#Zoom background moves fast, Amy moves faster|Thank you so much Amy for taking the time to jump on a call and talk about messaging for our upcoming ROI webinar. It was such a helpful step in working through the last-minute changes and webinar prep. And on a larger scale, I personally came away with even more clarity on how to continue evolving, improving, meeting new needs and approaching projects with purpose.  Thanks for always being willing to jump in, and for turning a touch-base meeting into a super valuable half hour. I know your Zoom background for 2025 will be just as inspirational\n\n7#Thanks for Making Me Feel Welcome in My First Week|I want to express my sincere gratitude to Amy, Jenna, Helen, Kamille, and Kayleigh. Everyone made my welcome to Workhuman a very warm one, and it made me feel right at home.   I look forward to working with everyone in the coming weeks on new projects and initiatives, to ensure all humans we work with are properly engaged and informed, so they can feel they're part of the initiatives in their own ways.\n\n8#Behind the Scenes Crew|Thank you to my behind the scenes crew for all of the support leading up to and during the Companywide Check-in. From multiple tech check sessions, to re-working the space and cameras so we could get the best lighting and views, to being live on slack throughout the meeting to work through the details live. It doesn't happen without a great team. I appreciate the partnership and the respect for quality! Thank you!\n\n9#What is a great week|OMG, what a great week!  I just have to say thank you for your enthusiasm during the AI Hackathon.  It was truly magical to discuss AI ideas with you, especially on how to increase recognition on the platform. It was amazing to see different areas coming together to work towards improving recognition.  Thanks again for all your effort—you made my week so much fun!\n\n10#Plan the Work and Work the Plan|Team, thank you all for a highly collaborative, productive, and engaging workshop this week. We took two full days as a team to review program, cultural, and MELT performance. We were vulnerable and transparent, we questioned everything, we debated critical growth areas and areas of improvement. Tyler provided a HX strategy update on how we plan the org and foster unity in the marketing organization. We walked away with critical next steps that will inform the unified GTM strategy in 2025 while setting the stage for a great H2 and 2025. Thank you all for the participation, the preparation, and for driving the business forward.\n\n11#That's a Wrap|The 2024 Spotlight Series just wrapped up! The 2nd and 3rd episodes were only a month apart! Thank you for your participation. The work started almost a year ago and each of you said 'Yes' to your role, whether it was work that spanned over the year, or involved being recorded for a segment. A lot of work goes into this event - planning, sourcing, promo, web, tech support, scripting, recordings, post-production. The list is long, and so is the list of humans who support this event. The team learned and pivoted over the year, modified the segments, adjusted the promo, never gave up on sourcing speakers, got creative with recording locations, and masterfully edited the episodes to include the best of the best content. Spotlight is the bass guitar of the Events portfolio - the important steady beat supporting our message and a platform to share it with the world. Cheers to all of you!\n\n12#Clifton Strengths = Witchy Super Powers|Thank you for organizing the team-building session and arranging the CliftonStrengths tests for us. I find this kind of activity fascinating. Although it's no surprise that I get a bit uncomfortable with messiness, you were well-prepared to guide us in leveraging our individual strengths for personal, professional, and team growth and showed me how to communicate around the messy. We saw an immediate use case in how I relayed a project to a member of my team! And it worked! It was incredibly enjoyable to engage in this exercise with the Corp Comm Leaders, and it’s an experience I will continually revisit as I learn more about myself and advance in my career.  We make lots of jokes about witches in this group -- but I think you really gave us a way to consider and make use of our powers. Corps Comms witches forever <3\n\n13#Awesome Connect!|Alessandra, Anais and Amy - a thank you for the great meeting yesterday.   Alessandra, for your time, the pre-read work, and your openness to ideas and new ways of working.  Anais, all the efforts you have put into the analysis and the way you succinctly shared them with us.  Amy, for getting this band together!   I for one am pumped for what is to come and how we might be able to contribute to some big goals.   Thank you!\n\n14#Queens of team work - helping our IRE efforts|I wanted to take a moment to express to say a big THANK YOU for the collective effort of you all made to make the IRE government (Minister Peter Burke, IDA CEO, Michael Lohan and Enterprise Ireland CEO, Leo Clancy) visit to our Framingham office happen this week. It was a big lift - looking at you Allie and Becca and having to be at the office before 8:00 AM to give the tour,  all the behind-the-scenes strings to organize meetings with them while they are in the office, and the additional work before the visit itself. This is a huge help to our Dublin office in general, not only for PR but to help us achieve our business goals here and open doors in EMEA. Couldn't be more grateful to be working with such dedicated individuals! thank you thank you thank you!!!\n\n15#Survey says...|You win! Thank you for your speedy response to our process survey.

Amy, thank you for acting with urgency and for fostering such excellent relationships with market leaders.  During a call with Maine Health (aka Maine Medical Center) Sue the VP of HR Shared Services name dropped Ed Boyle at Gallup that he was speaking at an upcoming HR team meeting. Hearing how Sue valued Ed's point of view, and also knowing Sue is currently leading a x-functional committee examining internal programs and their impact on employee engagement, and that they are considering making a pivot in their strategy around recognition, Dave, you quickly ghost-wrote an email that Amy could send to Ed asking for his support and endorsement of working with Workhuman. Amy, you jumped right on it, and within hours had this response:   \"You are so good at your job. How did you know about this meeting? I was literally made aware of it today. Of course I am up to a quick connect on this. Let me know what you need me to do and I will sort out how to work it into the session. Great to hear from you Amy.\"  That (visualize me pointing to the above) is the power of relationship, and a demonstration of how when all of us work together with a focused goal, we can move the needle, and do so quickly. Thank you Dave for connecting the dots between Gallup, Ed, Amy & Maine Health to seize an opportunity, and Thank you Amy for taking the baton passed to you and closing the loop.  I appreciate you both working quickly and confidently understanding who can help and taking the initiative to make it happen.\n\n18#In the midst of brilliance|As we reflect on the resounding success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I am compelled to extend my deepest gratitude and admiration to each of you. Your leadership has been instrumental in turning a bold vision into an awe-inspiring reality, cementing its status as the premier conference for business leaders worldwide.  Your meticulous attention to every facet of the event, from pre-promotion, central, design & experience to speakers, technology, production, communications and surrounding events, has transformed ambitious ideas into a seamless experience for over 3,000 attendees. Your ability to orchestrate, collaborate, and innovate—while setting egos aside—has not only elevated our brand and the WHL \"product\" but has also reinforced our promise to the community we serve.  The dedication, creativity, and problem-solving skills you displayed were pivotal in crafting an event that not only met but surpassed expectations. The quality of the keynote speakers, the depth of the sessions, and the flawless overall execution ensured that every participant left feeling connected and inspired. Your efforts have strengthened our relationships with customers, partners, and prospects while enriching the HR community and paving the way for new opportunities in pipeline creation and customer retention. The spirit of collaboration and inclusivity you fostered has set a new benchmark for excellence and showcased the true essence of Workhuman.  I am truly grateful for your hard work, passion, and unwavering commitment to excellence. I'm so proud to have you on ALL on the team. Thank you, every one of you, for your significant contributions.   Richard\n\n19#True Wrangler|Amy, thank you for being the speaker handler for John Baldino at both the Newcomers on Tour and the Lone Star Social. Because of your expert wrangling, John was at each event on time and prepared with his talking points. These new events were being tested out this year and I think including John enhanced the experience for the attendees. Appreciate the support!\n\n20#Helping a guy out|Amy, thank you for thinking about the human (me) in addition to the audience on our first day of Live.  It was a long day, and I needed to complete all of the D1 reporting in the new template.  When I let you know I would not make it to your social event, you quickly sent me a picture of a small work room you had there, and encouraged me to join everyone there, have some food and drink, and continue to work.  It allowed me to be present, complete the days work, and also enjoy being around the team.  I appreciate you!\n\n21#We Did It! -- Workhuman Innovation Launch|Thanks to this groups' hard work, collaboration, and innovative mindset, we were able to successfully pull off Workhuman's first product innovation launch. This required a great deal of cross-functional collaboration and I deeply appreciate how all of these teams came together and supported one another to create a stunning web page, powerful marketing campaigns, and impactful enablement for our internal teams as well as our customers.  All of this effort goes a long way towards advancing Workhuman's innovation reputation and further separating us from the competition. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\n\n22#Taking Care of BOK Financial|Thank you all for supporting BOK Financial during Workhuman Live!   They had a FANTASTIC time at the event and felt truly taken care of. Each one of you supported their experience in a unique and important way. With an opportunity to move them over the line this year, they had multiple exclusive events like J Prime, Aba, meeting Brene Brown, and the Thursday Takeaway session. We have gotten extremely positive feedback throughout the event and post event. WHL won over key contacts at BOK Financial and we will be sure to use this momentum to accelerate the process.  Thank you!\n\n23#Thoughtful Leadership Makes a Team|Amy, I've been reflecting on last week at WHL, and three instances keep resonating with me that I want to express my gratitude for.  First, on Monday night at the Austin Taco Project, you were the only one who thought to offer me the chance to take a break from checking in speakers. It allowed me to mingle with them, which made such a difference in my interactions with them the rest of the week. Your inclusion made a significant difference, and I cherished that time.  Secondly, being included in Issa Rae's meet and greet backstage was unexpected and incredibly appreciated. As a newer member, I didn't anticipate to be included backstage at all. Your decision to invite me, even though you could have excluded me, was so thoughtful. It led to a memorable experience and a team moment in that photo opportunity with Issa that I would have missed otherwise.  Lastly, during Andy's book signing, you ensured I didn't miss a special moment when everyone headed to the room where Richard gave a \"cheers\" to our group. Your thoughtfulness in including me left a lasting impression.  So all of that to say, I just want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your genuine thoughtfulness as a leader. I've always been in roles that often go overlooked by supervisors and members of leadership for some pretty cool opportunities like the three I mentioned here. And the fact that you were aware and thoughtful enough to include me, when you didn't have to, and when nobody else would have, is something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It truly means more than you'll ever know.  I feel incredibly fortunate to work for and alongside you. Thank you for everything you do.\n\n24#Workhuman Live Austin 2024!|As we revel in the success of WorkhumanLive Austin, I'm compelled to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for everyone who played a pivotal role in orchestrating what has indeed become the world's leading conference for business leaders.

Cheers to the entire team behind WorkhumanLive Austin!\n\n25#Writer’s Room|Thank you to the Workhuman Live Writer’s Room! I’ve always wanted a writers room and you guys delivered. Having a sounding board, a place to discuss and brainstorm, to swap ideas, to tease out difficult narratives - this is what’s makes a story come alive. We always have to balance the heart and the head with this conference. It is a balance of altruism and direct business objectives. Getting that balance right can be infuriating at times and needs a thoughtful approach. I think we got the balance right. Jen, you were juggling so many strands and so many different voices, it is a wonder you didn’t go mad! Thank you all for your diligent efforts and creative energies. Well done!\n\n26#Avanade Case Study Filming Help|Thanks to you all for shortly disrupting your day to help capture b-roll for Avanade’s Microsoft Teams Case Study shoot.

Cheers!\n\n27#The most innovative leader|Amy,  Daily, I am floored by your unwavering dedication to driving innovation within our corp comms team.

Your ability to inspire and motivate others is setting a remarkable standard of leadership for us all. So lucky to be a part of your team.\n\n28#Department Meetings|Thank you all for the help, guidance, logistics and planning, that went into my department World Tour these past few weeks! It's actually a difficult thing to accomplish logistically. Getting the right amount of attendees, whilst making sure there was enough department concentration in each meeting so that I could tailor the talk to the specific circumstances, was a balancing act. I was disappointed that my rider at each location of Crunchies was cruelly ignored, but I pushed on  😂 A special thank you to Amy who, mercilessly, had to sit through every one,  and listen to mostly the same talk track time after time - what an accomplishment! Seriously, thank you all for the endless help!\n\n29#We got this|What a few weeks for our tiny team of two. While the change we're going through could create anxiety, unease and fear in a person, I have none of these feelings. With you as my leader, I know we are making the right decisions and I believe whole heartedly that you are the greatest leader I have ever worked with. You care. About it all. Even the little things that no one should care about. Knowing I have you to support, guide and laugh with me through the week is what gets me up on a Monday morning. The Corp Comms team is hashtagblessed to have you.\n\n30#Many Thanks on this special occasion|Ladies, First off I am beyond blessed to work with such amazing, passionate, group of women. These past few weeks leading up to this soft opening this week you have all either jumped in last min or has been on for the long run. I am at a loss for words for the dedication of leadership, team bonding, taking charge where needed, and being the running support system that our Workplace Experience team needed at such a crunch time. I look around at this strong amazing set of women and thank my lucky stars to have you on our side as we step into this new chapter at our beautiful space. Thank you all and we appreciate your time and leadership. Keep shining through, as today might be international women's day but you all lead the pack all year long. Be proud of the ladies you are and keeping shining!\n\n31#Thanks To My Onboarding Buddies|Today marks my 3-month \"anniversary,\" so I'd like to thank all of you for helping me get off to a great start. You have been kind, empathetic, helpful, and fun to get to know and work with. I still have a lot to learn from you - and everyone - and I'm motivated to rise to the opportunity with you. Thank you!\n\n32#Powerful Reflection|Amy, there almost aren't enough words to express my gratitude for how far our relationship has come. The psychological safety you have fostered, moments where you've pushed me to grow, and the support to do so that you've continued to give. I take something new from every conversation we have. I deeply appreciate how we have grown together and am so lucky to have found you as my leader after all of the change I have been through. As I wrote my first reflection, I reflected on the challenges and accomplishments I have experienced under your guidance. Giving me the opportunity to reflect and feel pride for so many reasons was a powerful exercise. Thank you for leading the way you do, albeit challenging at times, it's pushed me to truly look within and learn so much.\n\n33#Prize is Right!|Thank you all for your participation in playing Prize is Right at Activate! While not everyone could win the grand prize, we appreciated everyone being willing to go up on stage and have some fun!\n\n34#ACTIVATE Appreciation|Taking a moment to express my gratitude to this incredible group! Each of you contributed to the joy, support and camaraderie I felt at Encore this week. From deepening bonds, making new friends, being a breakouts cheerleader, or trusting the cards process (if you know, you know), I was personally touched by your kindness, teamwork, and trust. Thank you and cheers to an amazing 2024!\n\n35#Respect for honesty, candor and proactiveness.|I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional work and dedication demonstrated by Amy Rice and Amanda Grady this week. Their partnership in kicking off discussions has been truly commendable, and I am grateful for their honesty, candor, and proactive approach.  Amy and Amanda's commitment to taking proactive steps to elevate Workhuman to the next level and secure key opportunities for Eric is exemplary. Their efforts not only contribute to the success of our team but also align with our collective goals for growth and excellence.\n\n36#Reorg? More like WEorg!|They say change is hard. Heck, it definitely is.  BUT…. when you’re lucky enough to have a talented, engaged, and supportive group of players in the mix to work through it, together, it gets a whoooole lot easier.     Over the past several weeks, I engaged you all asking for your time and insights to support us collectively working through the “who does what, now?” of it all. Along the way, I’ve been continually impressed with how you all handled the work.  Each of you was clearly driven to make yourselves available amid all the other daily work. What’s more, along the way you all remained consistently engaged, thoughtful, open-minded, and positive in the face of working through the change.   Did we cure cancer? No. Have we solved every little thing that needs to be solved for? No. But we certainly solved for the vast majority of the most pressing aspects of the new “who does what” for our restructured creative teams. That is a major milestone and something we should all celebrate.   Thank you all for stepping up to help get this done, together. Here’s looking forward to starting of 2024 with what, to me, looks to be some of the strongest alignment we’ve ever had regarding how our Marketing creative teams are structured and what work they each support. Upward and onward!\n\n37## Clutch - Commendable Comms|Amy, you’ve been pivotal in constructing tailored communication strategies for a variety of business endeavors and audiences. Your adeptness in crafting briefing points for the ICG litigation, Pay Equity Comms, and the Financial filing all while skillfully managing our international PR agencies has greatly contributed to the success in how we navigate these uncharted waters. Your creation of an internal narrative that is honest, fair, and timely speaks volumes to your pulse on the employee,  dedication and perspective. Your strategic thinking, thoughtfulness, and unwavering leadership during challenging periods have been truly commendable.\n\n38#Content Strategy & Governance Committee Kickoff|And we're off!  Big thanks to this group for joining the Content Strategy & Governance kickoff, filling out the content questionnaire with valuable insights on content challenges and solves, and for the engagement and enthusiasm about improving content visibility, messaging consistency, integrated planning, content processes - and more!  We're doing big things with content strategy as one team and I'm grateful to each one of you.  Looking forward to continued collaboration in the months to come.\n\n39#Collaborative effort for '24 Marketing Planning!|Thank you team on all your ongoing efforts with the 2024 GTM Marketing planning process these past three months. Because of all your dedication to urgency and vast detail, we are in a fantastic spot for 2024 strategy and budget scenarios. We have taken our learnings from last year, adjusted accordingly from both a preparation and execution standpoint which has allowed our internal processes to continuously improve. You all came to the Integrated workshops ready to collaborate, identify potential gaps, having those healthy problem-solving conversations to build stronger ties and making decisions for a successful 2024. In addition, the technology and headcount asks tied to different scenarios was a big lift in a month’s time and we were able to solidify our business need well within our timeline. Amazing cross collaborative effort, thank you all!\n\n40#The Three Musketeers|While I think Richard was definitely right about us being a mighty team- he was only slightly wrong. We’re not a team of two, we’re a damn good team of three. While sometimes it doesn’t seem as obvious, it’s the three of us together that’s allowing us to make such an impact. I’m beyond lucky to work with the two of you and I would be lost without you both. I wouldn’t swap our team for the world. (I bagsy being Goofy)\n\n41#Launching Workhuman's first Star Search!|Sending so much appreciation to this team for the ideas and work put in to launch our first ever internal star search! Kylie - from jumping in on day one (which was also basically your day 1!) and taking the lead, to Jillian and Helly, for your internal comms advice and magic, Jen and Jill, your edits to copy and great ideas for how this search can progress and test, and Amy, for accepting the baton when I was in need of a pass. Thank you all for your teamwork - I can't wait to see what comes of this initiative! Thank you!\n\n42#Major Microsoft Integration Milestones|Last week was a big one full of major wins tied to the Workhuman integration for Microsoft Teams and I want to than you all for the huge role you played.

With a few conflicts and reschedules, you agreeing to take this on kept the work moving forward. When I returned from vacation, I had everything I needed to quickly execute on the video and write up. Given the starts and stops in Q1, this was especially appreciated. Thank you for the support!\n\n48#Spotlight Success: Thriving Workforce|Congratulations on yet another remarkable Spotlight activation!

Just because something's your responsibility, doesn't mean it doesn't deserve acknowledgement. Thank you Spark 😉 Inheriting an internal function came with a lot of new relationship dynamics.

I am confident in our approach and the the tools we have defined to tackle everything together. We have found our groove.

Looking forward to seeing what we can accomplish together! 🙌🏻\n\n50#WHL Forum - An Only Workhuman Can Do Event!|Team, I want to express my sincere appreciation and take a moment to recognize you for the remarkable team effort that made the first-ever WHL Forum in London an extraordinary success this week. The energy and dedication you poured into planning and executing this event from garnering 591 registrations, and securing inspiring speakers, thought-leaders in Dan Health, and customers from Sanofi and bp to localizing the event creative, sourcing local entertainers with the “Showstoppers”, and executing a seamless and flawless logistical plan — you were all truly exceptional.   Your passion, expertise, and collaborative spirit showed our mission and values on center stage! We created a perfect balance between knowledge-sharing and networking, leaving everyone feeling enriched and motivated - evident in how we captivated our audience and ignited their passion for creating a positive workplace culture (reinforced with our data) while allowing participants to actively engage, learn, and exchange ideas with their peers.    Your collective efforts helped support our annual business goals by creating an opportunity to engage with 72M in active pipeline across 15 opportunities, 27 customer accounts representing 280M in annual billings, 4 media interviews onsite, and 30 product demos with high-end brands like Rivian, Pearson, Lacoste, and Virgin Media.

You both also raised the flag when we heard feedback about needing to streamline the speaker agreement in order to make this amenable to the bp team. On top of that, there's a completely new (read: more stringent) process to get speaking engagements approved by bp! Nathalie even said herself she wasn't sure if we could make it happen based on the circumstances! I also appreciate you keeping the momentum going while I was out on PTO - you have been invested in getting this speaking opportunity to happen since day 1.  Emily - thank you for hearing us out completely and taking quick action on revising the contract so that this could be a win-win for both us and the bp team!  Hillary - thank you for your guidance, explaining the legal language in \"plain English,\" taking an early call with me to run through it all to finalize the agreement on our side, and for helping us push this over the line to send an executed speaker agreement for counter-signature!   Amy and Kathryn - you do whatever it takes to make things possible and you make it FUN. I appreciate your determination, energy, flexibility, and passion. I'm inspired by working with the both of you. You make me want to be better and do more  Thank you ALL for your incredible team effort here! So fortunate I get to work with this group of varsity players.\n\n52#It's time for the Daily!|Amy, thank you for partnering with me on our daily reporting at Live.  We had a lot of happenings to capture each day, and you quickly whipped up a template, tagged stakeholders, and ensured the daily delivery. With so much happening every day in real-time, reporting can often fall to the side.  But you ensured it was a priority and helped tell the story, and ensure all were informed.  I so appreciate your help and commitment to the events.\n\n53#Behind every great speaker...|...is an amazing announcer! To this group of amazing WHL breakout speaker announcers - a HUGE \"THANK YOU\" SHOUT OUT!  You were the hype-makers, the time-keepers, the \"stay calm & keep calm\" crowd controllers, and of course made our speakers shine! I personally want to thank you for being a vital part of the success of our breakout sessions this year. You not only showed up but you SHOWED UP! The rapport you each immediately built with each of your speakers was evident, and you reflected the energy in the rooms.

Kudos to all of you!\n\n54#Workhuman Live – thank you for working the event!|I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work that you all did in the planning and execution of WorkhumanLive San Diego.

Your commitment to excellence in planning and execution throughout the event truly helped to strengthen our relationships with customers, partners, prospects, and the entire HR community.

Thank you all for making this event such a success!\n\n55#It takes a village!|Thank you, to each and every one of you for your unwavering support of the Speaker team. Throughout WHL, you were always on standby, ready to jump into action no matter how big or small.  From the early morning tech checks (which grew unexpectedly on Tuesday due to the previous day's travel delays) to the meet-and-greet sessions, printing all the things and author book-signing escorting - you were there for us.   I know that it can be nerve-wracking to be asked to take on new tasks on short notice, but you rose to the challenge. It's because of your willingness to go above and beyond that we were able to navigate it all with such ease.  Thank you! Your contributions have made a difference, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have such a fantastic team by my side.\n\n56#You made me look good!|Thank you Kathryn and Amy for all the support and guidance leading up to my two sessions this week.  You both jumping in last minute on the Accenture session and taking the reigns to direct into a productive, relevant session was so helpful.  And then Amy your targeted suggestions on how to dig deeper with Mike at Cisco really helped to great an engaging interactive session, and we got great feedback.   Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate it - you might think this is just your job, but I can tell you not all companies get this level of support.  It really made a difference and took a lot of stress out of the pre!\n\n57#Jumping in, doing great things|Thank you both for representing on the CHRO panel call this morning - there is a lot happening and I was double booked.

We are super excited for this event and cannot wait to have a provision (or two) with both of you!\n\n60#Putting Work(human) in the Spotlight|Team, congratulations on another really successful Spotlight.  Thank you for your due diligence from scripting and developing the theme, integrating its production alongside Activate 2023, sourcing the speakers, building out the intro and outro's and Q&A for the panelists, facilitating the questions for \"Human's on the street\" and for capturing critical and timely workplace perspectives. As a team, we achieved 95% of the goals we set up with remaining goals (meetings) to be smashed over the next 30 days.

I know you all went through months of preparation and planning, dotting “I’ crossing “T’s”, creating virtual, in-office, and in-person experiences, filming and facilitating Differentiator workshops, and more.

Thank you, graduates, for investing time in your own development!\n\n73#✨ Spark Director+  [Psychological Safety] ✨|💡 \" Psychological Safety is a shared belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.” – Amy Edmondson.     📊 In 2012, Google embarked on a quest to build the Perfect Team. An initiative code-named Project Aristotle studied hundreds of Google’s teams to better understand why some stumbled, whilst others soared. Google’s extensive research corroborated the importance of Amy Edmondson's coined phrase, discovering that Psychological Safety is a paramount component of High Performing Teams.   ⚠️ Building a fearless organization that truly embraces psychological safety will leverage the benefits of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), attracting and retaining a diverse environment of talented individuals, in addition to promoting innovation, connection, and a sense of belonging (DEIB).   🚀 Spark Director+ is a self-discovery journey within an overarching Leadership Learning Track, offered to Directors and Senior Directors who manage teams of all sizes.   📢 Please join me in applauding our enthusiastic Workhuman Executive Leaders who participated in this month’s Psychological Safety module: Adam, Amy, Andrew, Colleen, Jason, Jeff, Laura, Linda, Martina, Michelle Drozdowski, Michelle Lane, Michelle McDaid, Niall, Rich, Tyler, Varun, and Zhennaa, thank you for your valued partnership as Psychological Safety Ambassadors.

Thank you for all the amazing work, for the collaborative spirit, and for being dependable, strategic partners.\n\n75#That's a wrap on 2022 live webinars!!!|Amy, Kathryn, Maya - I can't express how appreciative I am of all your support this year on webinars. Reflecting back on the past year and what we accomplished is truly something to be SO proud of. You all are absolute rock stars at what you do and I've learned so much from each of you. I'm so thankful to be able to work alongside such smart and talented people who are always putting out the best of best content to ensure we give our audience something meaningful!

By the numbers, this milestone represents two-year growth from 8,000 in 2020 to 50,636 (and climbing)! That’s an incredible 532% increase in demand growth in just two years' time!     The journey to this massive accomplishment started back in October 2021 with thoughtful and intense demand and brand planning, pragmatism of breaking big goals into smaller channel by quarter forecasts and plans, followed by superior discipline around performance management week on week, and critically aided by our partnerships with Sales Ops, Analytics, and Enterprise Architecture.     From web leads, to webinars, social surrounds, press amplification, Spotlights, and countless hours refining the leads scoring and ingestion models, this was a department wide effort through and through. As impressive as this achievement of goal (ahead of schedule) is, more than the outcome itself, it’s demonstrative of your collective discipline, collaboration, and commitment to quality execution. We’ve learned much from this journey that will inform and enable success in fy23 and beyond.     On behalf of the Senior Exec Leadership Team, congratulations on making the impossible, possible!    -Tom\n\n77#Marketing Analytics Stakeholder Rockstars|In this season of gratitude, I'm excited to thank this team for your collaboration in all things analytics.

Thank you for trying something we’ve done before, exploring and accepting the unknown, and for coming together. This advertorial and the earned piece will put us in the conversation. You should all be walking around with a ton of confidence and pride.\n\n83#82,000 and counting ...|Team - I wanted to take a moment and celebrate this tremendous set of milestones achieved in our webinar program strategy this year (so far). From the very beginning, you tackled the challenge of a \"webinar a week\" with gusto. We saw the momentum generated by a monthly series in 2021, and thought, hey, more of this would be better ... and has been (like a lot) better, and bigger! More importantly it's driven meaningful business outcomes and served as a pillar for promoting customers' success with us, and our unique leadership view on top issues facing HR leaders. Outstanding work here from content to promotions to technical execution. I think we'll hit 100,000 registrants this year! Onward and most definitely upward! -C\n\n84#Gearing up for 2023!|Amy - Thank you so much for all the time you've spent recently making sure our internal and external teams are read into all the planning happening at the moment.

Congrats on great progress in Part 1. Excited to finalize it and head toward Part 2! -With gratitude, Richard and Chris\n\n86#Maximizing every opportunity|I had about 3 different photos of you working at Unleash, and decided on this one as at one point you put on your sales hat and gave a demo!

Your input will help shape future sessions as we continue through this journey, building stronger ties between our respective teams and making decisions that help us operate more efficiently and move the department and ultimately, the business forward. I hope you're as energized and excited as I am about making more progress over the next several weeks to finalize our strategic marketing plan for 2023. THANK YOU ALL!\n\n89#Got a Minute?|I call on all of you so often, asking for a minute of your time that usually turns into 15 or 30 - sometimes even a lot longer. And you all always say yes, making time to collaborate, provide feedback, bounce ideas around. Thank you for your generosity - of your time and your thoughtful insights. I appreciate you for your constant support that helps me through business decisions, improving projects, and sometimes just everyday life.\n\n90#Support System|Amy, Kathryn and Miranda: Taking a moment to express my appreciation for the ways each of you have supported me in the last month.   Miranda, thank you for driving me 20 minutes out of your way in rush hour Boston traffic so I wouldn't have to take an Uber into the city and for always being such a supportive and responsive teammate (particularly when Kathryn and I ask for Salesforce information)!  Amy & Kathryn: Thank you for all of your backup efforts while I was out on vacation. From Amy jumping on a last minute call with a customer speaker on my behalf and Kathryn picking up all of the WHL SD contract slack, I feel so supported and appreciative of this team!\n\n91#Connecting the dots|Amy - thank you for setting time for us to connect. Its been a while since we've checked in, and the conversation was really productive. We have a number of shared goals, and today we talked about some of our mutual needs for 2023. You shared some great insights, and took action to set up some future collaboration time with our partners to ensure we are all moving forward together. This offer of support and teamwork is so valuable, and I want you to know how much I appreciate it.\n\n92#Amazing HR Tech & Analyst Briefing|Amy, thank you so much for showing me the ropes at my first conference with the Workhuman team, trusting me with analyst briefings-- and, of course, congratulations on showing us all how it's done when it comes to getting attendees into the booth!\n\n93#Building and Nurturing Relationships|Amy – I want to recognize you for taking the lead on developing and nurturing customer, influencer, and employee relationships. Scheduling apps and drinks with Brady Bagwan, Jason Lauritsen, Isha Vicaria, and me at the Public House at Luxor in Vegas allowed us to show our human side while prepping for the next day’s panel at HR Tech. The result of our time together is likely a written case study on Morgan Corporation. Some of the best business deliverables come from stepping out of the boardroom and into the bar – and you made it happen. And it goes without saying that these events bring us tighter cross-functionally, aligning sales, marketing, and data analytics as one Workhuman.\n\n94#Alignment, Teamwork, and Execution|Thank you to this amazing team for our first run-through of the Social Conscious Task Force! All of you were quick with your feedback, thoughtful in your responses, and focused on the best approach for our humans and company. So proud to work alongside each of you. The end result of the Queen Elizabeth II message went over extremely well with our humans and illustrates who we are as a culture.  Thank you!\n\n95#Spark Coaching Graduates - Class of April 2022!!|\"Coaching works because it's all about YOU.

You were tagged a little prematurely to review and I appreciate you taking a step back while the team worked/tweaked creative to get it to a better place for comments. It really helped eliminate any potential swirl. I hope you took a well-deserved break from work/workfront after that :) Thank you for helping move the project forward!\n\n97#THANK YOU!!!!|Amy, Kathryn & Maya – Thanks so much for the amazing support on all our WH and 3rd party webinars/ events for EMEA.

Really enjoy working with you all!\n\n98#FROM RACHEL ABEL: A Night Out with Friends|It has been such a joy working with you and your talented team this summer! You challenged me to approach business problems in new ways and were there to support me and answer questions each week. A highlight of my time at Workhuman was dinner with your team during the week of Spark Summer – it felt more like a night out with friends, and I know that’s because of the special bond and culture you’ve established with your team.

I cannot thank you all enough for your dedication and support in this process. The progress made in just 4 weeks is astounding. Maureen, Jen, and Christina, this could not have happened without your expertise and commitment to the cause. Carrie and Kevin - the design of these comms is so refreshing and different from what we're used to, I can't wait to see how you continue to evolve them. Lauren, Rachel, Traci, and Melanie, you all lent your expertise and knowledge to help make this what it is and I'm so excited to continue working with you on all things customer. Tom, Chris F, Chris D, Richard, Derek, and Amy - your leadership, support, and trust in all of us helped us move fast and get results. Miranda your enthusiasm out of the gate helped keep me motivated through it all. THANK YOU! Can't wait to keep going.\n\n100#Work Smarter We Said. We just did!|A year and a half ago, we promised each other that we’d go into ad testing during the development phase of new WH commercials - to ensure we put a higher quality and insight-driven concept into the market. Today, that promise has become a reality. Thank you all for staying on the path, for delivering and collaborating with each other, and for all producing the latest animatics for testing. I’m so excited to see the results and which concept \"proves out\". We know we've got more work to make these great and hopefully this change in \"how we work\" will make the next phase more focused and efficient.\n\n101#Pfizer Customer Story!|30 days ago we made a decision to capitalize on an incredible customer story opportunity with Pfizer. We’ve gone from brief, securing a senior Pfizer executive, main story production, capturing user testimonials from a myriad of people across their org to building relationships over dinner in NYC and final asset editing ..... all in under 30 days. Thank you for your commitment to our customers, for making decisions promptly, and for collaborating cross-functionally. This is all in service of ensuring that we maximize the business impact of the relationship and the created asset. We’re going to have such a great asset for marketing, customers, and sales in the future and your collective leadership made this all possible. Thank you!\n\n102#Spotlight Q3|As we finalize the final final final edits of the spotlight talk show, I want to recognize the collective effort of this team. From the theme development, run of show creations, script writing, speaker sourcing and selection, project management, show production, technical tests, show video edits, marketing promotion, internal viewing party activation & comms to all the areas I’m not even aware of. You’ve planned the work and worked the plan so the final show is going to be great and you should all be proud of what we’ve delivered. Now, let’s go execute it on Tuesday! Oh, we've got 7K+ people registered! Let's go.\n\n103#Thanks for the opportunities|Amy, you recently got in touch to ask if I would do a SHRM webinar with the author of \"how to be a diversity and inclusion ambassador\" Celeste Warren. Imposter syndrome definitely surfaced during our chats but you reassured me that I was the right person to do this.  Thank you for seeing me and encouraging me on this and other occasions! I cannot stress how much it means! ❤️\n\n104#On Behalf of Jonathan Guerrero - Thank You!!|To the entire marketing team, thank you for such a wonderful and educational experience.

Congratulations on such a huge undertaking that consistently keeps the pulse on the state of the workplace. This endeavor has gotten consistent attention in the media, social media attention, and has created multiple conversations across the web.   Take a lap everyone, this is an accomplishment to be celebrated!\n\n106#This is long overdue|What started as a connection over a shared passion for chocolate has become a true fabulous working partnership!  From helping me prep for my first WHL and working with our Partners and Analysts, to answering my many questions to give me insight into historical practices and best practices, to ensuring we keep my team prepared for all of the PR things, to always being available as a sounding board when I am working through an issue - you are there. You exemplify the power of collaboration and transparency. I truly appreciate the opportunity to work with and learn from you.  Thank you for being such a fabulous teammate and being available when needed.\n\n107#Webinars, Webinars and more.... Webinars!|Amy and Kathryn - Thank you both so much for all the work you do to support webinars. From securing speakers, working through content, getting on calls, reviewing materials,  meeting urgent deadlines and to being just overall GREAT partners to work with. On top of all other events, and projects you work on you are both always available and responsive and I am very grateful for that! We are aiming to have 4 webinars promoted as a \"series\" in Q4 which means we are running on some tight deadlines in order to get briefs submitted on time and you've been working hard to secure spots with customers and thought leaders! I've especially admired your work ethic, the ideas you bring to the table and how you lead by example. It's been a blast working with you both and I'm excited to continue the journey!\n\n108#Yesterday|Yesterday was a rough day. Especially for most of you who may have had flashbacks of March 2020/San Antonio. You put your heart into building an event. The decision to postpone is not an easy one even if the data tells you want you need to do.  Today you refocussed, on San Diego. Tomorrow and the next and the next - you will pour your heart into leading future Workhuman Live events. I see your dedication to producing nothing but quality events and experiences for attendees. I applaud your courage and leadership in doing what is right for the business. Thank you for communicating to your teams quickly and fielding many questions around next steps. Ready for San Diego!\n\n109#Best.Team.Ever.|THANK YOU for hiring so many wonderful people to fill your team, and trusting your leaders to also hire wonderful people. Despite being located all over the country, the Corp Comm team culture is thriving thanks to your leadership, humor, and advocacy.\n\n110#Spotlight behind the scenes|The upcoming Spotlight has outstanding conversations, essential topics, and relevant guests. But it takes more than that to create a great piece of content - thank you both for your storytelling and selecting/preparing our speakers so they get to what is important for our business and companies everywhere.\n\n111#Leading from the front!|Amy,  You’re doing an incredible job leading and guiding your team to the “promise land”. You’ve integrated new team members into the culture and key initiatives, they’re delivering high quality work wit the results to show, and they’re having a ton of fun doing it. You’re also focusing on your own development - leading transparent conversation with execs about your growth plans. Oh and little trickle a few mini “crisis management” situations into the mix to round it out. Keep being you. Keep leading. You’re making a major difference.\n\n112#Cool as a Cucumber|Amy - Since Day 1, you have answered every question instantly, with a smile and, without hesitation, taken the time to explain more than what I ask of you. Your talent and your dedication to Workhuman is remarkable. You always make sure Steve's best interests are at hand and always make sure I am involved. Your sorority poker face brightens my day. Thank you.\n\n113#Leading us to success!|A two-part shout out! Thank you for organizing such a great planning session, today and in June! The agenda was well organized & made it easy to stay on track + breaking out into groups was a helpful way to discuss challenges/collaboration opportunities. Secondly, I really appreciate your feedback style and you taking the time to meet one-on-one to discuss/review. I’m thrilled to be a part of your team!\n\n114#Coaching|Amy - Thank you for your support and coaching. You're advice consistently gives me a good perspective. It is always timely and helps me action things in an effective way. I appreciate your help!\n\n115#Thank You|Just a quick note of thanks to this amazing group of humans for coming together to produce a solid, comprehensive summary of Gallup report performance and activity!  There's no shortage of goodness in this report - from PR coverage to content production and activation across campaigns - all of which shows the magnitude of our collective efforts to position Workhuman as a thought leader in workplace recognition.  I'm so proud to be part of this team - and grateful to work alongside all of you.  Thank you!\n\n116#Cheers to our First Global Workhuman Partner!|Team, THANK YOU for being a part of closing our very first global partner at Workhuman: Qualtrics!  Each of you played an essential role in helping throughout this partnership journey.  Your help brought us to where we needed to be, which included: shaping the story, advising on the process and people that need to be involved, coordinating the meetings, bringing our unique value and capabilities to life through presentations, creating a memorable experience for them, providing technical guidance, and formalizing the partnership through contract.  This partnership is the first of many, and the hard work begins here.  I couldn't have done this without you.  As I arrive at my first anniversary at Workhuman, I feel blessed to work with an amazing group of individuals (who also happen to be a lot of fun!).  Thank you again! 🥂 #WorkhumanTogether\n\n117#Counting Content|Team - Thank you for the agility and responsiveness to a recent request for a summary of content in key areas of focus. You've all collaborated to create some impressive first fun content, and reacted swiftly with ideas on where and how to leverage it to support a broad set of upcoming initiatives. Appreciate that this was all done expertly and within a 24 hour turnaround period! Onward! -C\n\n118#Comitship|Amy, Jenna, and Simone - From leading the RFP process, to briefing Comit in person in Ireland, to now having a feature in the Irish Times. You hav all shown amazing grit and courageous leadership getting to this point. Thank you for playing your part in building our awareness and reputation in Ireland.\n\n119#LinkedIn B2B Institute Edge Program PR Opp|Richard, Amy, and Jenna - Thank you all for jumping on the opportunity to help showcase the great work we are doing both with the LinkedIn B2B Institute Edge program as well as our awesome performance branding in general! The LinkedIn team are solid partners and so it felt so great to reciprocate with a joint PR effort. Amy and Jenna, thank you for vetting the opportunity and the delivery. Richard, thank you for being open to filming the case study and executing it during WHL week nonetheless! This effort highlights Workhuman as an innovative company and the marketing team as best-in-class, featured alongside HP, Oracle, Infosys, and more.\n\n120#So if you do the math....|we just bought ourselves 80 hours. I like that ROI. Thank you for investing in the planning process and each other this week. It may feel like we barely scratched the surface, but there were a lot of good discussions and new ways of thinking over our two days together. We have lots to dig into together but I'm excited! I appreciate being on this journey with this team. Thanks again!\n\n121#Collaborating to Deliver Quality|Amy, Wendy & Kathryn - a huge THANKS to each of you for the above and beyond, tireless support (especially as it overlapped with an already busy Workhuman Live schedule) and coaching over these past many weeks, allowing me to bring my best to our recent Evanta CHRO Keynote. And Lisa, a very special thanks to you for being so collaborative, helping me land finishing touches to my presentation. By all accounts, our session was well received and I couldn't have done it without you all!:)\n\n122#It takes a Workhuman village! (part 5)|Last week was the culmination of the efforts by so many to bring the Executive Forum to life at Workhuman Live. Joining the team only 6 weeks before the event, I was blown away by the work ethic, camaraderie, and creativity of everyone involved. Your support, encouragement, and tireless commitment to the finished product (both during the final stretch of planning and onsite) far exceeded anything I could have ever imagined in a team, and your efforts were instrumental in delivering an impactful program for ExF members. Thank you for bringing the vision to life. It was a sincere pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.  With the craziness of the event, I fell a bit behind with recognition in the final 2 weeks leading up to the event. Please know - your contributions did not go unnoticed.   Sarah M., Sarah B., Stacy, Chris – for your strategic thinking on continuing the conversation with our ExF audience. Sarah M – for attending the ExF sessions and crafting an informative and actionable blog post; Sarah B – for compiling a curated stream; Stacy – for your logistical wizardry and input on video content elements; Chris – for your expertise in capturing moments that will advance our ExF mission  Reid – for your outreach efforts to the CNBC Council and the BC CEO Club    Kathryn & Amy – for your exceptional work with all-things speaker-related. Kathryn – for scheduling the calls with speakers to align on content, for tracking down approved marketing copy and final presentations when agents went M.I.A., and for your commitment to the success of the Exec Forum with everything else on your plate. You are superhuman! Amy – for your guidance with the Optimist/Speaker dinner strategy and securing/writing ExF speaker intros – thank you!  With tremendous thanks for your involvement and contribution to this process – congratulations on a job well done! Onward to Dublin!\n\n123#Turning vision into value|From when I started 2 months ago until now, each of you has been instrumental in laying the framework for the evolution of the Executive Forum. Your leadership, advice, and trust in me in such a short time has been humbling and is deeply appreciated. As a group, thank you for your overarching leadership and strategic input throughout my tenure thus far as we begin to harness the potential of the Exec Forum and shape it into an effective tool for achieving our business goals. Individually, I have been moved by:   Jill, Jeff & Richard – your fearless leadership, patience, flexibility, and guidance along the way, when your plates are beyond full. You continue to rise to the challenge every day, and it is inspiring to watch.  Eileen, Jen R, Tom & Celia – your vision and commitment to the success of the Exec Forum as witnessed by your strategic feedback and mobilizing outreach by your respective teams   Chris & Chase – your steadfast commitment to keeping things moving forward, positioning Workhuman at the forefront of thought leadership, and capitalizing on the momentum built in Atlanta  Amy & Jen P – your strategic and creative feedback, guidance, and mentorship in the moments woven between the To Do List items  Kathryn & Abby – your innate ability to collaboratively help me turn vision to value within your respective roles while simultaneously juggling your numerous other responsibilities. I am grateful for your time and for showing up and prioritizing the Exec Forum  Though we are just getting started together, we have already made great strides - which is cause to celebrate. Thank you for all that you do. Here's to the next phase!\n\n124#Unleash is over!|I'm not sure any of you even had time to unpack from Atlanta before you had to re-pack for Vegas. Thank you for all you did for Unleash on-site and doing an amazing job to make this show happen. Safe travels back and hope everyone can enjoy their long weekend of well deserved rest!\n\n125#A leader who shines!|THANK YOU. Thank you for both encouraging me to jump into the deep end (immediately!) but also always being right there with a life vest and helping hand. Working through WHL breakouts, Mainstage, content and more in this whirlwind has been such a joyful learning experience and discovering and developing our team groove is really just the best. And seeing you command the stage with Priya Parker last week?? How cool, how inspiring - having leadership like yours and seeing you shine on that stage makes this job that much better. These past few weeks have been both fullfling and exhausting - but you are always ready to support and I cannot wait for all the exciting, creative things to come!\n\n126#You helped a mom “blow her daughter’s mind”|I want to thank you for your willingness to help a mom who reluctantly asked me to see if we could somehow get Simone Bile’s signature in her daughter’s second grade yearbook (which had a few pics of Simone). As she approached me after a session, she hesitantly pulled out the yearbook and showed me the page her daughter had bookmarked.    When she finished asking, I told her it can’t burt to ask and that I knew the perfect person to help. When I found you and explained the request you didnt hesitate to say you would try. As Simone’s session began, you calmy sat down and handed me the signed yearbook, as if you hadn’t just created a miracle for this mom amd her daughter.  As soon as the session ended I reached out to the mom. As she approached me I could already see the tears in her eyes. We shared a few watery eyed hugs. She asked if she could thank you (which is where I sneakily captured this picture and video). Her words were “I couldn’t be more thankful!”  “My daughter’s mind is going to be blown (8 year old daughter had already asked dad to call mom and check in). She also indicated she had made the mistake of only buying a day pass and would be attending the entire conference next year. She shared that her colleague almost moved her family vacation so she could attend this year, because that is how much she loves Workhuman Live. I love that you closed the conversation by sharing where the conference would be next year and selling her on WHL in Dublin. But most of all I love that you helped create a “peak” moment (per Dan Heath) that this mom (Melissa Parks) will never forget! Thank you for representing what it looks like to work human!\n\n127#Setting the Stage Like a Pro|To our amazing group of humans who took the stage to announce each WHL breakout speaker - BRAVO!!! This role required poise, prep, guts (especially for anyone not used to big audience public speaking), and energy - engaging the audience and setting the stage for the speaker talent. No small feat! Amy kicked us off by introducing Priya Parker on Monday afternoon and when her heel stuck in the stage floor, she handled it like the pro that she is and showed us all \"how it's done\" with grace and humanity. Everyone truly stepped up (yes, pun intended) for last-minute fill-ins when needed, seizing new opportunities and rising to the occasion. Thank you all for your collaboration and flexibility, and for truly making the breakout experience so phenomenal!\n\n128#An unstoppable duo!|Wow! Wow! Wow! Amy and Jenna - first, thank you for being the best humans in general. Second - thank you both for taking me in and letting me learn, grow, and laugh with you. Third - thank you for elevating the WH brand, both at WHL and every other day of the year. As we continue to grow as a company I cannot wait to see the amazing work you continue to do to make Workhuman a household name.\n\n129#What a line up!|The first live event in 3 years, brand new to the team, major staffing changes, major keynote changes, and so many more obstacles in your way. You both ran nearly 60 speaking sessions as if none of that even existed. You stayed calm, executed plan Bs as if they were plan As, and delivered world-class content to 1,500 people. It was a master class in running a speaking program!\n\n130#The Me for the We|Congratulations on a remarkable WHL Atlanta! Transparently, I struggled with this recognition as no amount of words would accurately summarize how I feel about each and every one of you. So, I’ll keep it short. Good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We. Your leadership throughout the planning and execution of WHL Atlanta was on show in full force and everyone was witness to its greatness. Your impact on the Workhuman business is immeasurable. Your collaboration and communication in good and tough times were timely and evident. Your impact on 1,500+ people was visibly life-changing (evident from “ugly cries to ugly laughs” and the glowing smiles throughout the event).   In the famous words of Nelson Mandela, “It always seems impossible until it’s done!” I'm super proud of you.\n\n131#So much to say, so this is for being awesome!|Amy,  What a month! First, that Gallup survey! Wow! The fact that Fortune picked this up with the headline, \"There’s a fairly inexpensive way companies can save millions in employee turnover costs\" is amazing! Click and bait!!!!!!!!! That is perfect messaging and you just made Jason and the Sales team A LOT busier. Your leadership within Workhuman to navigate this project with Gallup was extraordinary. And the results were as good as we could have wanted. Every company on the planet should run to our website and ask for a demo with this report. And in your \"spare time\", you ensured our industry analysts attended our evening event at WH Live and wrote an incredible press release about our relationship with a long-time customer. You get things done - and the things you get done are meaningful and massively valuable! I appreciate your partnership!!\n\n132#Belt Save!|Backstage. All Ready to Go. Simone Biles! Not So Fast! Where is my Black Belt?! Packed it. Can’t find It. Fashion Police Coming for Me for having mismatched belts and shoes. But then a lighthouse appears, two actually. Amy Rice sends out a Spark Signal. ‘Need a Black Belt…waist size 33. Anybody, somebody?!?! Chris O’Sullivan sees the signal and responds immediately and comes to the stage and saves the day!!!! And as you can see in the photo, I have the belt and Simone was impressed!!!! Thanks to both of you!!!!!\n\n133#Transformational Work!|Amy and Jenna,  Your due diligence and focus on the right outcomes for our business has landed us a powerful and impactful asset that we can use / reuse for many months to come.  Congratulations on getting the Gallup report over the finish line and for building a robust communications plan to lead the role of this report to the world. All your effort and tears (Jenna) will be worth it!\n\n134#Speedy Interview Team|Thank you all for your help interviewing candidates for the Sr. Customer Comms Specialist role last week. From open req to offer out to candidate it was barely more than a week! in large part to Lynn having a great understanding of what I was looking for and some candidates already in mind. Fingers crossed the offer is accepted but I have no doubt you all communicated how great this opportunity is!\n\n135#The speediest interviews, ever!|I can't thank you enough for being so quick to share your very valuable time this week (and with so many things happening - less than two weeks from Live). You five were the perfect sounding board for the Speaker's Bureau interview process and all gave fantastic, helpful feedback and insight (and so fast!). For a variety of reasons our timeline needed to be expedited and you all were ready to jump in. Thank you!\n\n136#Ain't nothing like getting together.....|Team - that was SO much fun, thank you to each and every one of you. It's a great company to work for, but what makes it even more special is the people. New and familiar faces bring all kinds of opportunities to connect, and I'm grateful I got the opportunity to spend time with all of you! Go, Sox!\n\n137#One Gallup Poll at a time!|Amy, Jenna, and Sarah - After months of interviews, global surveys, internal stakeholder discussions, steerco meetings, press release drafts, etc., you organized the final readout of the Gallup Research findings to the executive team today. Aligning the research to our business objectives (current and future) is no an easy feat and you've managed to represent the challenges/opportunities clearly and gather the results we need to validate our story for years to come. With a few minor adjustments, I'm really excited to see these findings come to life in our content, at WHL, and in the press. Thank you all for your leadership, due diligence, and pursuit of organizational alignment. Well done!\n\n138#A Royal Welcome|I appreciate you all making me feel so welcome on my first night (and first time ever visiting) Massachusetts!\n\n139#Giddy Up for Gallup|Ladies- we're in the home stretch for the launch of the Gallup report. I want to recognize the outstanding work you both are doing to raise visibility of this partnership both internally and externally. Meetings are happening every single day to push this forward. I really appreciate your dedication and partnership. Let's do this!!!\n\n140#Clean Harbors SOARing to New Heights!|CONGRATULATIONS to the entire Clean Harbors Launch Team!   Each and every member of this team contributed at a critical moments leading up to our April 4th.   This swift and successful launch gave birth many opportunities for growth, including bulk uploads, new R&R programs, possible Workhuman Certification (Enterprise) while fortifying the important goals of improving retention and engagement in their workforce with special (and Presidential) attention to their truck driver population.  Yes, on the day of launch, the Clean Harbors Program Manager was invited to the White House to discuss the importance of improving inclusivity and engagement for women and minorities in the trucking industry.   Our PR team, with little notice, turned around some talking points just in case preparation met opportunity for the PM to speak on behalf of Workhuman Cloud.  Clean Harbors kept us on our toes but in the end the Program Manager shared that in her 32 years of being a part of implementations, rarely if ever, has an implementation gone this smoothly.  An enormous thank you to each and every member of this team!!!!\n\n141#Exec Forum Superpowers Unite!|Team - I wanted to recognize and celebrate how exciting today's call was for this critical Sales, Customer Strategy, and Marketing growth initiative! Collectively, this group of superpowers has rallied to make great progress and develop a compelling experience and workshop plan for our Executive cultivation ambitions at Workhuman Live and beyond! Great collaboration and mash up of diversity of thought between tenured and new joiner perspectives. Onward! With gratitude, -C\n\n142#Steering Around Icebergs!|Amy and Jenna, this week was hard! You led hard conversations with our agency partners about competitive pressure and performance, onboarded a crisis management agency, and built mitigation plans to ensure business success. You both handled the conversations with honesty, transparency, and with a solution mindset. We’re getting stronger, more strategic, and therefore naturally expect bigger and better results. We’re on the right track! Keep up the great collaboration and work!\n\n143#Goodbye QBR! Hello BPR!|Performance vs. Plan Weekly Meeting Team - WOW! What a quarter! We are pacing to 10,000 MQLs for Q1 vs. a forecasted goal of 8,500. On behalf of Richard and myself, we wanted to recognize this core group for your willingness to sunset old practices that no longer served our growth goals (we mean you QBR), and replace them with agile, current, and dynamic approaches to generating performance insights, actioning trends, and week on week tight management of forecasts, actuals, and course adjustments. This represents and important discipline and newly developed \"muscle\" from work that began way back in October 2021 in support of our aggressive growth goals. You invested significant cross-functional time to develop an integrated 2022 Marketing Plan. And you keenly recognized that the plan may not go as planned. So rather to wait and react, you all committed to this business performance review format and week after week dug in to the detail of what was working and what wasn't, and rapidly responded to correct or accelerate where needed. Thank you for charging at this big goal with pragmatism, confidence, and courage. Onward to Q2! With gratitude, Chris and Richard.\n\n144#Spotlight Success|Team – what a massive win on today’s Workhuman Spotlight event!  It was an absolute thrill to watch it.  Thank you for the ingenuity and reimagination that went in to concepting and planning this new ‘talk show edition’ format, and for all of the detailed execution that went into todays broadcast.  You all nailed it!  From audience acquisition, to garnering fantastic talent for the show, to the ‘on the Streets of New York’ segment which I thought was a hit, to the carefully constructed questions and content to highlight the many opportunities and challenges facing HR today, not to mention the flawless streaming, it all came together extremely well and showcased our natural place as thought leaders and drivers of this important ‘future of work’ conversation.  Steve – you handled the job of navigating the conversations with Laurie, Steve and yes, even the unscripted Gary Vaynershuk too, like an absolute pro.  I’m excited about the demand this event will undoubtedly drive in the final weeks of Workhuman Live Atlanta registration, and equally as optimistic about our prospects for more Spotlight events and format testing in the future.   Thank you to this cross-functional team of trailblazers and innovators, and congratulations on a fantastic event!\n\n145#Setting the Stage|Amy & Cara, Thank you for all your help and support working with the partner speakers.  These are a new category of speakers which also plants seeds for opportunities in the future.  Thank you for trying something new and different and seeing the connection of possibilities that link to the broader Workhuman!  Cara, you've done a tremendous job meeting with the various partner speakers and setting them up for success.  You provided the right amount of information and answered their questions.  They felt comfortable joining our event, especially in a world where we are just starting to come back in person.  You are also full of creativity in the different types of sessions they can have.  Amy, thank you for being an extension of the outside-of-the-box thinking!  Depending on the type of partner and topic, you helped walk me through different ideas and ways the partners could present and showcase their expertise virtually.  Several thought leaders had already signed up, and they're looking forward to being a part of it.  A special THANK YOU to both of you for this partnership and the ability to think BIG!\n\n146#Truly Amazing Teamwork!!!|After working for something for such a long period of time, it's fun to look back and think of all the little steps along the way that got you to the finish line.  We recently were able to bring Seagate into the Workhuman Family, and it wouldn't have been possible without this amazing group of individuals helping make it a reality.  Thank you all for your support throughout this incredible journey, which includes - prep for meetings, meetings, custom demo's, marketing campaigns, a micro-site, more meetings, more demos, value creation sessions, Workhuman Live Speakers, RFP preparation and submission, a trip to Denver, references, finalist presentations, follow up meetings, security reviews, pricing discussions, negotiations, and I'm sure a few more that I can't even remember.  It takes a herculean effort to bring in a new customer on board, and you are all truly appreciated...thank you, thank you, thank you!!!\n\n147#Leading the Way|Amy - I wanted to take a minute to recognize you for your approach to doing high quality work and holding others accountable to your standards. Being a leader is hard. Influencing others is harder. Influencing at Workhuman is harder still. You continue to do it effectively in a highly visible team without missing a beat. Thank you for being a great partner in helping to grow and evolve the market team and our approach.\n\n148#Gallup Dream Team 🤩|Amy, Jenna, Meisha-ann, Isha - As Gallup walked us through the initial amazing results of our research project, I realized I needed to give each of you a special shout out for your dedication and engagement on this project. Jenna, you've been my partner in crime on this since we first talked to Justin last summer. Thank you for always being available to talk through strategy, project management, internal pitches. And you're doing amazing work now to plan a huge PR splash come May and into the summer. Amy, you've been instrumental in getting this project approved and communicating its importance across the organization. You're also picking speakers and driving the executive steering committee feedback sessions. Amazing. Meisha-ann and Isha, you both have been with us for nearly every weekly touch base with Gallup, bringing your research expertise to the conversation and ensuring this new research augments everything you're doing in Workhuman iQ. I'm so grateful to all of you and so incredibly excited for the world to learn the business impact of recognition in just a few short months!\n\n149#Spotlighters|You are not the ones on stage. You are backstage working to make the spotlight shine on our speakers, guests, content, message, brand - all the things. Workhuman Spotlight - talk show edition is 2.5 weeks away. The recording is done. The work is far from done. I see you, working on this on top of your other work and our other events (Hello? Atlanta!). You are right on your spot doing what is needed. Thank you for your dedication, stamina, and commitment to the events, the team, the business. Cheers!\n\n150#Progress not perfection...|Amy and Brian - whatever would I do without you? THANK YOU to you both for your focused energy and time dedicated to all things WH Certified, to ensure the relaunch is a success! We made some big strides last week, thanks to your introductions and scheduling with key marketing, brand, and web dev colleagues. I appreciate your sense of urgency to drive our project plan forward to maximize the time between now and WH Live. Excited to be on this journey with you!\n\n151#In the Spotlight|Team, Wow! The Spotlight shoot today was amazing. As a team, we spoke a lot about due diligence and dotting our “i’s” and crossing out “T” and today you proved that we did exactly that. We captured incredible content from well prepared speakers alongside a world class crew. It’s our collective effort that will allow this content and our message to spread across the world! Thank you for dedication, focus on quality, and commitment to getting us to this point. Proud moment. #progress. Thank you\n\n152#EAD 2022|Amy - Thank you for being a source of support, guidance, friendship, humor, and above all else the power of NO for the past 3ish years. Of all the valuable tidbits you've shared with me, I will take away the practice of writing down things when I notice them. It's something I used to be in the habit of doing frequently and thanks to you, picked up again in the past year or so. Being able to visually reflect on where you've been allows you truly realize where you are in the present moment. It creates a space for you to recognize the beauty and the growth that exists in the here and now. Appreciate you!\n\n153#How can I help?|That's what you ask almost every time I tell you about a challenge.Thank you for being so willing to jump in and solve problems. You are so generous with your time, expertise, and problem solving ability. I am so grateful for every conversation; your POV always makes me think - you make me better.\n\n154#Ukraine Communication!|Wow! We could have done nothing like our competition - but that is not who we are or why we exist. In under 24hrs this group mitigated brand media risks, developed internal and external Comms in support of Ukraine, gained buy-in for WH to match 20K worth of donations, and drafted our company position on the terrible situation occurring in Ukraine. You united together, placed egos and hierarchy aside to impact millions who need it the most - As Kevin said, always assume positive intent and lead with our core values of respect!\n\n155#HR Leaders Teamwork|Thank you both for all your efforts on the HR Leaders Workshop program.  Amy, you recommended interesting topics that were both important to the executive audience, but also unique to previous workshops, and therefore positioning Workhuman as the leader in the space.  You were also instrumental in getting the right clients invited to the event.  Abby, thank you for advising the SCD team on the event and rallying them to participate.  We've now got a great list of executives to invite to Workhuman Live - thanks for all the help!\n\n156#Sales and Marketing All Hands...And All Good!|Laura, Amy, Lee, Mark, Chris, and Jason, Thank you for putting together a call that helped everyone in Marketing.

I appreciated your preparation, clarity of message, and the several pearls of wisdom!\n\n157#Watch what happens LIVE!|Team - What a fantastic, engaging, and dynamic panel-driven Marketing and Friends Sales-focused All Hands today! Thank you for your hard work in preparation, Jason for your well-articulated and thoughtful keynote and Jason, Laura, and Amy in the supporting question and answer panel segment. Lee and Mark in the mechanics of making it flawless. Feedback has been incredibly positive. Thank you for your support and embracing in this new approach to Marketing All Hands to help land our strategy, connect the work to the goals, and create new pathways\n\n158#Thankful for you!|Amy, thank you for your support on our HR Leaders event coming up next week.  This event is serving many purposes by driving Executive level MQL’s, offering multiple speaking opportunities, cross-promoting WHL and the Exec Forum, exposing new topics in the market that align to WHL, and so much more.  You have been an instrumental partner in working with us and the team at HR Leaders by supporting the content story, coordinating our speakers, and ensuring that the investment in this sponsorship is maximized with the desired outcomes.  We see how much you have on your own plate, and the constant prioritization decisions you are making to focus where the need and value is – and I am so thankful you have been able to include this program in the mix.

Thank you for showing up, staying invested and bringing your collective expertise to contribute to the success of marketing analytics.Go team!\n\n163#Q1-derful!|Amy, Laura, Gavin, Katie, and Julia - I wanted to highlight and recognize the comprehensive and collaborative demand generation plan you and your teams have put in place for Q1! It reflects the hallmarks of our 2022 Marketing Strategy: fewer, bigger integrated campaigns, anchored on key themes, and designed for leverage and re-use! These plans span brand, ABM 1:1, and programmatic demand campaigns. We are well positioned for success and growth as a result of your teamwork, leadership, and careful, longstanding planning work done in the trenches of Q4 2021! With gratitude, -C&R\n\n164#Let's Go!|Amy, I've been incredibly impressed with the leadership, work ethic, and resilience. From leading your team, solving challenges head-on to driving the development of channel-specific strategies for SEO, Social Media, Earned and Paid PR, and Content Marketing, you have set a solid foundation for a great FY22 and we're already making significant progress toward our strategy board goals. Thank you for focusing on the end (results) while supporting and stewarding the team on the development of the initial plans. Keep your eye on the prize(s)!\n\n165#Thank You for Everything|Amy - As I start to transition to WHiQ full time, I wanted to say thank you for your mentorship and guidance over the last 2+ years. You have been such a great advocate for me and my work both in SEO, and more recently, in analytics. Thank you for being a sounding board and a partner as we expanded our SEO strategy, brought on an SEO agency, and created the brand dashboard. I'm really looking forward to working together in my new role to build on all the great things the team has been working on and will work on in the coming months!\n\n166#Team Connection and Cheer 🌟🎄|Thank you Amy, Jenna, and Simone for organizing an energizing and productive external comms get together this week. It was so refreshing to meet in person and see everyone's lovely faces. Human connection really is critical! And the secret Santa exchange was a really fun way to get to know each other. Cheers to more connecting and collaborating in 2022. 🥂\n\n167#Communications Partners Extraordinaire|A big thank you to this mighty team of communications professionals for being fabulous partners in crime in 2021! We came together this year like we really haven't done before. Thanks to your leadership, Amy, you collaborated, recognized the need for deeper partnership, and organized the team to support our biggest customers with great co-marketing opportunities, valuable speaking opportunities, and set us up to have repeatable success in multiple formats. Our customers feel the partnership shift. Our Strategic Client Directors feel the partnership. Thank you to the whole team for stepping up, proposing great ideas, supporting great ideas, and delivering incredible content for all to leverage. We are better aligned to deliver the right messages at the right time, deliver the right speakers for the right opportunities, and really organized for the team to strike in the right moment. Many sincere thanks to each of you for your expertise and energy and commitment! Big things to come in 2022!\n\n168#Cheers to you!|Amy - Thank you for an incredible year of support, realness, and overall growth. You have led the external comms team through some massive wins this year. Creating new functions, huge media hits, onboarding agencies, moving away from processes that no longer serve us, adopting new ones, and always–ALWAYS–focusing on communicating with the team as much as possible. I have never worked with a leader who is more open to share information across the board as you, all in the name of keeping us informed for the better of the business. Something you've taught me since I first began reporting to you, last year and when I started reporting to you again this year (LOL), was to write down when you are trying something new. \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it\".  This Ferris Bueller quote comes to mind when I think of your advice here, because it's true. We move so fast in our day to day, that if we don't take the time to stop and look at where we are compared to 1 month or even a year ago, we will never recognize and appreciate the growth. It's a simple exercise that has a huge impact on confidence and appreciation for the journey. Thank you for an incredible year of growth, connection, and support. Grateful for all you do!\n\n169#Lights, Camera, Action!|Thank you all for taking the time to come into the office on a Monday and be a part of the video for McGraw Hill. Consider this your official Oscar award from me for best background actors for a textbook video ever! I so appreciate the teamwork and the time you took out of your busy days to help.\n\n170#There is a Superhero in all of us|Blown away again by his team's commitment to dropping everything to come together and use their collective talents to drive the business. Here's to all of you in celebration of teamwork!  When it matters most, we step up, rally the troops, and march right into the battle headfirst. Yesterday was another great example of what happens when you bring great minds together, the sparks fly, the ideas flow and suddenly we have a solution. There is a Superhero in all of us, we just have to put on the cape. Cheers to the team!\n\n171#Gallup Research Project Exec Prez!|Amy,  You evaluated and negotiated the Gallup Research project, united a cross-functional team to plan and kick it off, led your team to manage specific components of the deal, and more.  You recently presented the overview of the project to the SELT where you received significant praise on the overall value of the package and we're just getting started. The outcomes from the project will be instrumental in our business. Keep leading - you making a significant difference.\n\n172#Webinar Extraordinaires!|Julia, Amy, and Laura - I appreciate your outstanding teamwork to develop and deliver our most recent webinar featuring Merck's successful application of AI-driven in the moment micro-coaching (or Inclusion Advisor as we like to call it). You achieved over 700 registrants and garnered great response from a key prospect account, UPS, I wanted to highlight as part of this recognition moment:  - \"That was EXCELLENT!!! ... I downloaded the presentation, and am forwarding it to a manager in DE&I for further discussion.  I’m working to make a recognition platform a reality, as you know, so the more additional business units support this effort, the better! ... have a great Holiday Season.  I’m looking forward to 2022! Kindest regards, Jamie Werner, CRP | Ancillary Benefits | UPS\" - Moreover, you've set us up for more leads this month with the additional webinars planned. This is great momentum to take with us into 2022, so we hit the ground running, and keep our \"Without the human it's just work message\" \"always on\" in the market. With gratitude, -C\n\n173#Thankful to be on your team!|A wild year made easier because of your compassion, empathy, and leadership!\n\n174#Allyship in Action|Sometimes it gets exhausting when you're always having to call things out. But on this day, you two stepped in and did it. I can't say enough how much that means to me. Not only were you upset on behalf of others who got left out of the antiracism blog article and the lack of representation, you did something about it. This is what true allyship looks like. I am honored to know you and glad to work with you. You both make Workhuman better. Thank you so very much.\n\n175#Thankful to Be on Your Team|Amy, just wanted to send a note of gratitude for your steadfast leadership of our team. I can only imagine the amount of slacks, meeting invites, calls you have on any given day. Yet you always make time for the team, prioritizing 1/1s, sharing relevant company info, and so much more. You're always looking out for what's best for the team and clear on priorities so we can focus on what really matters. I know not always easy so I want to say I really appreciate that and I know others do as well. Thankful for you!\n\n176#Scenario Planning Sesh #1 was what I'd call a Win|My head is spinning from all the inspired thinking in today's planning meeting. Thank you for sharing your Plans on a Page <or is it 'Plan on a Pages?!'> with the broader team. Thank you for deep diving into some of our Marketing priorities to identify integration points, gaps, opportunities for testing, and more. It was awesome to see different people gather to collaborate cross-functionally and spend time thinking about the \"what if sh....scenarios.\" And lastly, thank you for being good sports about the ice breakers questions. From Buzz Lightyear to time machine travel, childhood crushes  and early retirement dreams, I learned a lot of new things about each of you today!  And yet, I am sure you all agree that it felt like we barely scratched the surface in our three hours today. Not to worry! This is the starting point and I have a good feeling that this was just the first of many Scenario Planning sessions to come. So strap in and look forward to next steps AND the next invite. I am excited to work together to ensure we are set up to deliver business results, feel proud of our work, and have some fun along the way.\n\n177#Planning for Purpose!|Team,  What an incredibly informative, purposeful, and quality team-building day! Thank you for being present and prepared, for sharing your FY22 department vision and goals, and for collaborating on a unified FY22 brand marketing plan and most importantly our guiding purpose as a leadership team. I feel energized, optimistic, united and supported, and look forward to taking on the challenges that FY22 will bring.\n\n178#The goal is progress, not perfection!|“First steps are always the hardest but until they are taken the notion of progress remains just a notion and not an achievement” — Through a time of transition, new planning processes and forecasts, and current executional needs this team has been exceptional. You’ve come together, forced needed changes, asked the right questions, and most importantly you’ve done it as a team. Thank you for leading by example, overcoming the daily challenges, and for accepting new perspectives and approaches.   You are building our game plans now so we can all enter the stadium with confidence together next year.   Remember, The goal is progress, not perfection\n\n179#Customers are internal too|I would like to award Amy, who took time out of a busy schedule, to offer her expert guidance and knowledge that will help me with a project that I am involved in. It would have been easy to push a meeting out to another time, but the respect shown me as an internal customer is fantastic and merits recognition. thanks, Neil\n\n180#The Long Term Solution|Amy and Nick, thank you both for preparing and facilitating an insightful overview of our SEO strategy today and our future focus at the Exec Progress Meeting. Nick, the significant growth of the Workhuman SEO landscape has been dramatic over the past two years - your technical knowledge, due diligence in managing multiple internal and external SEO fields, and your focus on key metrics have been phenomenal to watch and now see in our performance. Amy, your leadership here is clear - driving our discoverability from PR, Content, SEO, and Social is no easy task, and how this team is coming together and unifying tasks is incredible to witness.\n\n181#Thank you for keeping it real...supported!|Amy, thank you for continuing to support me and my role on the comms team, especially during the past few weeks. I appreciate our honest, solutions-focused discussions and the actionable plans that we walk away with.  To say that we are operating a machine with a lot of moving parts right now is an understatement, so thanks for leading the way in such a strategic and considerate way.  Thanks for all that you do!  Cheers!\n\n182#Covering for me|Amy, Roshni, and Micah - This has bern a truly harsh week for me. Having to miss a busy week at Work due to being sick is never easy. And this is my first time doing so as a people leader, so it adds another level of complexity. I really appreciate you all taking things off my plate, covering at the last minute, and checking in with so I can rest and not have to worry. Thank you!\n\n183#Security Training|Hi folks - thanks so much for being active participants in the recent security training. We really appreciated the questions and comments that came from both groups - so much more learning takes place when people interact and are prepared to throw in their 2 cents on a topic - thanks again!   best regards, Dermot\n\n184#Grounding Our Foundation|Amy - Thank you for being our Rock during times of transition. When we found ourselves suddenly down two team members, you immediately set out to bring Strike 2 on board to help ensure we continue producing great content on social. Now that they're up and running, it's exciting to see the potential for growth! Not only that–you're always checking in, reminding us where our focus needs to be, and helping us stay grounded. When I say \"us\" it's all of us. Corp Comms, Marketing, Workhuman. You're everywhere! All that said, the support and attention you've shown Micah, Roshni, Angela and I  these past couple of weeks has been invaluable. THANK YOU!! We appreciate you 💯\n\n185#Strike 1, Strike 2, Home Run!|Thank you for all working so diligently to not only make sure the social team continues to execute and create, but also to work in a state of ambiguity as we realign resources. You have all ensured that we can properly onboard our new agency partners, over the past few months. We are starting to get underway, and are on the path to create even better than content than before. Thank you all for your diligence as we continue onboarding in the midst of continuing all of our other responsibilities.\n\n186#And thats a wrap!|Thank you for bringing your brilliance, remarkable talents, expertise, creativity, innovative thinking, and skills to drive the successful execution of the Spotlight broadcast and WHLive registration launch.  The work for these projects starts months in advance and continues for weeks after we go live. Over the last several months, there were endless moments of comradery, collaboration, and a continuous drive to raise the bar.    The road was challenging, but despite the obstacles, YOU DID IT!  You delivered a fabulous production and flawless launch.   Your passion is contagious. Congratulations and celebrate the moment!!\n\n187#Leading the way!|Jess, John, Richard, Chris, and Amy - thank you for putting together a great Brand All-Hands. I have heard from many folks who loved hearing from their colleagues and seeing all the great work being done.  What is also clear: we are a team who is committed to each other just like we are committed to excellence.  Thank you for leading the way today and every day.\n\n188#\"IRL practice\" for a \"Virtual success\"|Team - Outstanding to see all of you come together today to conduct final prep and plan for our Oct 6th Spotlight Broadcast. It is clear you all are laser focused on a great experience for our customers. Keep up the great work! With gratitude, -C\n\n189#If Slack Speed Dial Existed...|I would have you on it! Last week I was struggling to show up, process and get work done. We were chatting all things work and you made a point to ask me, how are you? And took time to listen to my oversharing, offered some free time to chat live about it and encouraged me to keep going but also pause if I needed to. I didn't call you (whoops) but knowing that I could gave me the energy to finish up the day, enjoying the evening with my family and remember that tomorrow was a new day. Thank you for your support and your willingness to listen.\n\n190#Supporting Women - WSJ!|Congrats Jenna and Simone on a strong piece of coverage today in the Wall Street Journal! In regards to hiring Abby when she was 9 months pregnant, Amy was quoted in saying, “Rather than worry about the stage of their pregnancy, more employers should hire women for who they are and who they can be.’’ I'm beyond proud and honored to work beside every single one of you strong women working to lift up other women in the workplace!\n\n191#WSJ!|Amy, thank you for: 1. Being a badass working mom, 2. Being open about your experience being hired while expecting and hiring expectant moms, 3. Telling your story to the WSJ! Not only did this story allow us to build rapport with a top tier journalist, but this online & print piece helps Workhuman's brand awareness. Again, THANK YOU.\n\n192#Leading with humanity!|Thank you, Amy, for your ongoing support, counsel, and strategic leadership that you provide our team.  You are readily available to help streamline processes, balance workload, and ensure that the speakers bureau is working as efficiently as possible.  I appreciate all of the support you've provided me since I started my new role in June.  Thank you for your commitment to quality, teamwork, and embodying Workhuman's values.  Cheers!\n\n193#Reaching all who need to know|Thank you to this wonderful team for your collaboration in getting our follow up comms reviewed and out to those who need them. Amy and Tyler, thank you for bringing up this important next step in our comms cascade - reaching those who have joined us via contract, but not started yet. And to Lauren and Christina for thinking about what to say in interview with candidates and getting that wording just right. And to Kerri for reviewing the messaging and and Katie for also ensuring the access to Workday and instructions were worded accurately. Teamwork for the win! I hope the resources are helpful as you now begin using them with your candidates and new hires (and those on leave!). I appreciate your responsiveness in helping us get this done quickly and in such a high quality way.\n\n194#Extra, extra! Representing our humans!|Thank you so much for your quick support as an extra for our Chronicle filming this week.

Can’t wait to see your smiling faces on TV!\n\n195#Award-Winning Chronicle: #1 in New England/US TV|Reid,  thanks to your grit and determination, you secured Workhuman on Chronicle! Thanks to you, we get to share our amazing story with a captive New England audience. Chronicle is not only the oldest and one of the most popular and awarded local magazine TV shows in the country (out-ranking all other in terms of audience growth YOY), it is the #1 watched in New England - with audience growth across all demographics that consistently out-performs all others in the country. It's not easy to get coverage on this highly popular long-running show - and you did it!    Now everyone in New England who works for a living - or loves someone who does - will know what it means to Workhuman.   Amy, thanks to your incredible set up and your leadership with Reid, a new teammate, Baystate Health will bring to life a thriving culture of recognition. They are heroes, in the 4th Wave of a Pandemic, who are willing to take time out to share what it looks like to Workhuman and why, during the hardest of times, social recognition has made all the difference to their employees and the communities they collectively serve.    WAY TO GO, TEAM!  Thrilled with this new phase of PR for Workhuman. Congratulations!\n\n196#Making Magic at Merck|Team, it’s been an exciting journey launching Inclusion Advisor with Merck. In the past few months, we’ve worked closely with them to get a presentation proposal about our IA partnership created AND accepted for World at Work. Cue months of careful planning to get to this point in the journey, when we’re invited onsite to record their presentation. Beyond that, their glowing words on their recognition experience, the impact on their employees, and their advocation of IA, the list goes on and on. As we watched Michaela and Christopher present today, it was pure magic. Our clients speaking authentically about our partnership and they’re so grateful for the support they received. Don’t just take my word for it, Michaela and Christopher wanted to thank you personally since they couldnt recognize you directly through their own INSPIRE program.\n\n197#Keeping the Conga line going!|Amy, Jenna, Chris – thank you all so much for jumping into the Conga line and being so enthusiastic about hearing their recognition story. I am thrilled you were able to meet the team today and hear directly from Wende and Adrienne why Conga Stars will play such a pivotal role in their business success and company strategy. You brought your energy, experience, and passion for getting great stories out to the market, and as I’m sure you would all agree, it completely energized the Conga team. The opportunities for sharing their story and it’s growing narrative are endless, and I cannot wait to see how brilliantly you all bring it to life.

Take a bow. You earned it.\n\n199#Without the human, it's just work|Jess, John, Richard, Amy, Tyler, Chris, Ana, and Dana - Each week, you bring your all to the brand leadership team vision, mission, and goals. From strategy to execution and everything in between, I am thrilled to work with you exceptional humans. So proud of the work we are doing together.   GO TEAM!\n\n200#NIST Assessments are so much fun!!!!|The NIST review back in February was 4 hard days of BSI consultant digging in to all elements of corporate to rate us against the cybersecurity standard. Roll on 6 months ….. include the production environment and ask BSI to repeat the exercise plus a Threat assessment. 9 days of interviews and delving deep into all our controls. A big thanks to all of you for taking the time, sharing your expertise and impressing the BSI consultant who is stunned by the advances we have made in the last 6 months. Gratitude to you all.\n\n201#Why Our Work Matters|Amy, thanks for setting up time to walk the corporate comms team through how all of our work is connected to both short-term and long-term business results. You took this action item from the wider Pulse Survey results to ensure we had an understanding of why our work matters. It was an hour well spent to take a step back from our daily tasks to look at the larger goals and how we play into that roadmap. Thanks again for putting it all into motion.\n\n202#Sweatin' to the... details|Thank you to this core team for the perspiration, inspiration, and attention to detail you've provided over the past few weeks as work to improve our tagging process for social. This initiative is critical. And you've all played a massive role. When Jon originally pitched to me the idea of coming up with a \"Formula\" for our organic strategy, I was admittedly confused. But I soon realized the value - not just for our content planning - but as a way to improve the way we tag, report, and analyze activity on our daily social media posts – and our website. Since then, you've been extremely patient and focused on helping us get to where we are today. It's taken a few rounds of word-smitthing, updating fields in Sprinklr, and getting new team members trained on utm's, but I am happy to see that we're now in a good place to be able to launch this new process next week! This level of detail and tracking is something we've never had before (at least on our owned channels) and I'm bleeping pumped for the insights to start rolling in. Thank you team utm-awesome!\n\n203#Respect for Quality QBRs!|With the pace of business and everything on our plates, it's easy to want to just keep your head down and march forward...However, it's important to stop, look back and evaluate the past. With the right mindset, the past offers lessons that can influence the future - helping us work smarter, make better marketing investment, strengthen our process, refine our messaging/creative and ultimately shape what we will test and optimize next. We wrap the 2Q'QBR up on Monday and I wanted to say THANK YOU to each of you for the time and effort you put into documenting and sharing key insights from your respective areas of marketing expertise. QBRs are an important part of the planning cycle and I am grateful for your commitment to them.\n\n204#Can't Thank You Enough|Thanks to the best and most talented team for making taking a vacation with my family so doable. Each of you went the extra mile to keep all the \"things\" going. On behalf of myself - and wife and kid - thank you. Now if next year you could somehow work with Mother Nature to make it less rainy.\n\n205#Dreaming of Dashboards|Amy & Nick, thank you for taking the time to walk through the bureau's Q2 reporting. As we continue to evolve our reporting at every level, it was very helpful to understand where we can double down and where we can pull high-level insights. I look forward to telling a more comprehensive story of how our speaking engagements impact brand marketing and the business.\n\n206#You can’t buy this on Amazon!|Amy, From the day you interviewed me, I knew we’d be great partners in building the Workhuman brand - it’s your direct and transparent communication style that’s refreshing and your solution orientated approach to solving the big problems that I just love and appreciate (literally cannot buy this style anywhere). Thank you for always looking at the bigger problem, providing solutions to better our marketing output, and for integrating our worlds (e.g. restricting social first content approach to market). This work (and thinking) will have a long lasting impact on how we go to market as a brand. The results will be known in the near future — lets go!!!\n\n207#Putting the grit in integrity|Team, thank you for all of your hard work, determination, ingenuity, and commitment to excellence in standing up the company's first brand metrics and dashboard.  It takes true grit to turn barriers into strategies, to overcome obstacles, and to stick-to-it even when facing the impossible.  The progress is awesome.   Here is to your continued success together!\n\n208#Thank you for your partnership!|Thank you all for a successful first meeting of the digital advisory committee! All of you shared personal insight and perspective that was extremely valuable in setting the stage for our executive council session. We are extremely excited about how the conversation will continue to grow and evolve moving forward and your voice will be a vital component to shape and maximize our web impact! Thank you all!\n\n209#Blue Check Mark!|Thank you to this team for all your hard work on getting us to this point - @Workhuman is officially VERIFIED on Twitter! One seemingly small step (among many) that are pushing us forward, towards becoming iconic. Since adding this badge to our Twitter profile, we've seen follows and interactions from other huge accounts with 1M+ followers. Great to see the immediate pay off here. In the words of Nuvs, \"Workhuman is legit.\" ✔️\n\n210#Making Onboarding and Taking Leave More Human!|Thank you so much for helping me onboard and dive right in to meaningful work. In my short time here I've been simultaneously onboarding and planning for a maternity leave. I've received nothing but support and genuine well wishes, while still getting my hands dirty with important work. I've only been here a couple of weeks, but this is the most seamless maternity leave I've taken thanks to the support of my own team, recruiting, and benefits! I cannot wait to get back into the swing of things after my leave!\n\n211#Content Crusaders|Amy & Jill, while this seems overdue from the May event, it’s top of mind for me. Coming back from maternity leave, I’m in awe of all the work you both took on to ensure the content at Workhuman Live Online was a success (and it was with a 4.7/5.0 rating!). This is not an easy area to jump into. There are relationships to form, quick deadlines to hit, and many moving parts. Thank you for the time and energy you poured into these sessions in my absence. You’re a huge part of the reason I was able to enjoy my time with baby Jules this spring.\n\n212#Rockstar Panel|Hi Team,  I want to send out this recognition moment to thank you for the time you spent interviewing candidates for our Newest Social Media Specialist addition to the team-Micah Lucas. Each of you brought valuable insights which helped me as I continued to hone in on what we needed for this role and I enjoyed working with each of you throughout the process. Jon, congrats on your first hire here at Workhuman. Looking forward to the amazing things this team will continue to accomplish.\n\n213#Supporting the Women At Work ADP webinar|Thank you all so, much for the support, help, preparation, ideas, inspiration and so much more in getting me prepared for the Women at Work ADP Webinar. I was thrilled to represent Workhuman at such an important event, and take my responsibility as a male ally very seriously.  I would not have been able to do the job without the support of you all. Amy thank you for coming up with the plan and for trusting me with this - Michelle, thank you for providing me with an education on the area - Reid, thank you for the speaker preparation that you and Bill went through to prepare my comms skills, and Simone and Jenna - thank you for the PR follow through after the event.\n\n214#Hired!|Amy - it is always a pleasure working with you on building your team - and this last search was no different. I so appreciate the way you approach this as a true partnership. I'm always a TINY bit sad to fill a job for you - because then we have to cancel our weekly check-ins and I don't get to work as closely with you for awhile. Thank you for your quick action/decisions, your open-mindedness in exploring a variety of backgrounds and skill sets, and for your kindness and energy throughout. Although I'm glad to have one less open req - I\"m looking forward to opening new ones on your team again in the future. Cheers!\n\n215#Moving the Brand Dashboard Forward|Amy and Richard - thank you for the tremendous feedback you gave Ana and I on the Brand Dashboard in our two sessions together. That feedback allowed us to really hone in on what this dashboard will become as well as make it the best it can be. It's great to hear both your perspectives and opinions as we continue in the later stages of this project as well.\n\n216#Lightening|THANK YOU team for all of your quick responses and fast action to get our newest hire situated for a quick start date. I so appreciate all of your efforts to make this happen in record timing!\n\n217#Structural Support|Thank you for your valuable partnership in preparing for and delivering today's post-WHLO webinar. As I said in our quick debrief, it feels so good to have such a qualified and attentive group of experts propping things up, making content shine, handling logistical details, maneuvering messy technology, and providing smart, just-in-time feedback. It's a pleasure working with each one of you! Let's do it again tomorrow!\n\n218#Twinning on Innovation, Collaboration, & Mustaches|Amy, First of all thank you for brightening my day with humor and knowledge!  You were a delight to meet with.  You certainly added a 'bow on top' to make the day even brighter!  Also, thank you for sharing your deep knowledge and expertise around how we work with some of the consulting firms from a Comms and AR/PR perspective.  I enjoyed building ideas and the art of the possible together.  Thank you!\n\n219#Conference Planning!|Well, where do I begin? We are officially on countdown to two of our largest conferences of the year which so happen to be within days of each other. Easy right? Well, for this team it comes naturally. Thank you to each of you for playing an integral part in the planning phase of this busy season and helping to make it such a success. Angela, you are the dream project manager. As soon as that project request goes through you are on it! Setting up tasks in Workfront and scheduling our kick-off calls to go through the details. Lauren, Alana and Liu each of you are essential to creating the catchy copyright and creative artwork to accompany our virtual booth and profiles at the conferences. Amy, Jenna, Simone and Reid have played a crucial role when it comes to organising and scheduling our keynote speakers as well as our overall messaging. Thank you to each of you for supporting us and here’s to the kick off of the conferences!\n\n220#Pioneering the Human Workplace|Thank you all for your months-long efforts in creating Workhuman Live Online. Together, you showcased the importance, impact, and transformative power of putting humans at the center of the workplace.    Doing that took the cooperation of teams across Workhuman, including Technology, Product, Workhuman iQ, Sales, Customer Strategy, Customer Service, Finance, Legal, HX, and Marketing. It was a tremendous effort, and in turn, I am immensely proud of what we accomplished.   I know there were difficult moments during the broadcasts, so I want to specifically call out the resolve and focus many of you demonstrated in supporting our customers and prospects with rapid-response access to key content.    While I would say, “that’s a wrap” the truth is this is just a beginning—the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and I look forward to seeing the impact it has our company’s growth in the future.   Ultimately, the greatest demonstration of the power of working human is all of you. So again, thank you for the commitment, hard work, and humanity you brought to Workhuman Live Online.    With gratitude, -C\n\n221#Upping our PR muscle|Team - these past few months have marked a monumental shift and up-leveling in our PR efforts and impact.  Together with bringing on a new agency, you have laid the foundation for Eric to build a strong relationship with the WSJ among others, and you landed the incredible interview he did with Josh Johnson from MSNBC on Friday night.  It was a fantastic interview and loved how much Josh was engaged in the conversation.  These are exactly the kinds of things we need to achieve, building from one powerful outlet to the next - and you did it with grace, determination, imagination, and grit.\n\n222#More Rewrites than a Hollywood Movie|Amy - Thank you for your help crafting a message. Your insights were incredibly valuable. I appreciate your partnership and support.\n\n223#WHLO Exec Forum Goes Digital!|It was a pleasure collaborating with you all on the WHLO executive sessions, boldly going where no WHL exec session has gone before - virtual!  Thank you for your strategic ideas, flexibility and dedication to the success of the sessions.  Thanks also for the timely laughs along the way!  Great work for such an important audience!  Cheers!\n\n224#Leading with Empathy|Mihai, Jen and Amy, THANK YOU for sharing your insight, vulnerability, candor, tips/tricks, and so many real examples of how you address the challenges that often get in the way of leading with empathy. As we were prepping for the session I thought, if managers can walk away feeling like they can breathe a little easier because they are not alone, that would be a win. I know they walked away with much more than that. The chat was on fire. Just a few of the comments: “Such wonderful learnings and so needed, today and every day.” “Thanks for taking the time to reflect, gather your thoughts and for sharing .... really good to have this practical workshop in this session.” “Amazing job MJ, Amy, Jen, and Mihai!  All of you were so vulnerable and inspiring.”  You did such a wonderful job providing specific examples, and building on one another. I tied this recognition to \"respect for all\" - for valuing one another's perspectives, and the perspectives of all of our people leaders listening in. I am so grateful that you gave your time and energy to this discussion. Thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\n225#All the right moves|Ladies, I have have been so honored to work with you on the WHLOL Executive Forum. For months, you have all prepared for these two hugely important sessions and every decision has been made with a commitment to an excellent experience, compelling content, teamwork, and respect for the program and to one another. It really has been a privilege to work with each one of you on this.\n\n226#Fastest keynote|Team, We just launched the second keynote speaker for Workhuman Live Online. You did it in record time. From negotiating contracts, making quick decisions, developing copy and creative, speedy approvals, building, trafficking, launching, coordinating schedules. We even recorded Common's session before we promoted him. That's a first! Common and Zain were prepped for a relevant conversation to close the event and drive home our messaging. Then on to editing. Oh my, so much editing to filter out the best of all the words. It takes a dedicated team of individuals with unique skills to include a keynote in an event. Thank you for your commitment to Workhuman Live. I recognize all the work you do behind the scenes to make it seem... common.\n\n227#Impressive|Anne and Amy,  In speaking with the PR leader for ATD, she shared that Rebecca (CHRO) was super impressed with her experience on the panel.  Her quote was....  \"in all the virtual events I have done, this was the most impressive team I have ever worked with. They take it to a whole new level\"    I can't thank you enough for all your hard work on the upcoming WHL event.  You made such a positive impression on her, and I am sure she will share it with her network.  She left the experience thinking Workhuman is first class all the way.\n\n228#Not Common At All|Congratulations on an outstanding fireside chat between Common and Zain. Your speaker prep and emphasis on our key messges came to life thoughout the entire conversation. Recognition, honest and actionable feedback, DE&I, and real life, relevent stories shine throughout this keynote. I cant wait for our company and our attendees to see the result of your great work.\n\n229#Launch of Hootsuite Amplify!|Today we launched our new employee advocacy program, Hootsuite Amplify! This 8 month long project touched a lot of teams and required tons of communication, collaboration, and attention. I want to recognize all of you for your support along the way that helped today's launch go as smoothly as it did. This is the first and an incredibly important step to becoming a social first organization. Thank you all for your contribution, patience, input, and dedication to the program's success.\n\n230#Interview Crew: Assemble|Team, I wanted to recognize you for the time and rigor you put into interviewing final candidates for the content team role.  Not only did you commit to multiple conversations and feedback sessions, you also fostered an authentic and vigorous dialogue that got each candidate excited to join Workhuman.  On top of that, we were able to identify the best candidate for the role and have them sign on!  Thank you for the gut checks, work sample reviews, and candor throughout the process.\n\n231#Collaboration|Outstanding job creating the Executive Forum experience for WHLOL. This took a lot of collaboration with our speaker to fine tune the content ensuring that it a session worthy of our top customers and prospects. I'm continually impressed by the efficiency and teamwork you've shown in developing this experience.\n\n232#Adam Grant In Market!!|What a week for this team.  Not only one WHLO promotional announcement but two.  We kicked it up about 1,000 notches to get Adam Grant negotiated, contracted, copy written, designs done, approvals all around, and in market.  Within just a few days.  This team continues to perform at an amazing level.  Every. Single. Day.  It was a chaotic, frenzied, and yes - sometimes frustrating week.  But everyone pulled together to execute.  Thanks to everyone for the teamwork, urgency and top quality work.\n\n233#Speakers and More Speakers|Almost feels like an in-person event to have this many speakers! Landing so many speakers is a huge achievement in a compressed digital event timeframe. Kudos. A second speaker announcement was not in the plan. But how could we not shout out about more great names and companies? Game. Changers. Even with an extra twist to get a couple of external approvals you launched the assets without delay. Thank you for rolling with the changes and still bringing your best to the work. It is your determination and dedication that is driving registrations. Cheers to you all!\n\n234#Leadership and Guidance|Amy- if all of my weeks are as fast as this first one, I'll be in for quite an experience. Thank you for all the time you spent with me this week. Looking forward to hitting the ground running and making an impact. Reid\n\n235#Cross-functional Teams for the Win!|Amy, thank you so much for connecting with me following our onboarding session. You have provided me with an opportunity to put my PR experience into action at Workhuman by connecting me with the team. I cannot express enough how appreciative I am of cross-functional teams!  Simone and Jenna, you were both so friendly and eager to hear my thoughts which left me feeling not only confident in myself but in our ability to work together. Thank you for meeting with me and for openly sharing your insight - you have tremendously helped me understand your approach to work. I am so excited to collaborate with you both!\n\n236#What a fab group of women!!|As I started to craft this award, I quickly realized - whoa, what an amazing and impressive group of female leaders!!!  As I scheduled this recent group of guest speakers to join our e-comm team meetings it never even dawned on me that you are all women, and wow, what a cool way to reflect on the success of this group and the leadership, innovation, and expertise you are bringing to the organization in your respective areas and to celebrate the success of women at Workhuman!  Thank you all for the time you took to join our recent e-comm meetings and for sharing details about your work, initiatives you're leading, ways that you're approaching the opportunities in your areas, and the results that you're driving for the company.  And beyond that, thank you for sharing notes about your career paths, about challenges you've faced and ways that you've managed through those, and how we can partner more closely together to drive success as individuals in our careers, our development, and for the company.  The team came away from each of these sessions with new learnings and opportunities to reflect and take away into their own roles and initiatives, and most importantly, inspiration from such fantastic leaders helping to take Workhuman to the next level.  Thank you and I can't wait to have each of you back later this year to share details on progress!\n\n237#Putting the Intelligence in Competitive Intel!|This award is long overdue!  Thank you for stepping in last month on various competitive market insights projects.   Our markets are rapidly progressing, just like our customers' needs. Because of your work, we are establishing a common understand of the competitive landscape and where we fit in and are differentiated.  Thank you for taking the extra time to gather materials and provide insights around movements, players, and trends - all within less than a day's turn-around!\n\n238#Support|Amy, thanks coming back to me so promptly when I reached out to you for support. Much appreciated. I really felt like you had my back!\n\n239#Diving into the deep end of the pool|Amy, I wanted to thank you for jumping, no, actually DIVING into the deep end of the WHLO pool. Despite laying a solid and well thought-out foundation for coverage while our newest parent started her leave, circumstances changed and we were stuck without coverage for a very full agenda's worth of speakers and sessions. Without missing a beat, you reprioritized your work, made some tough and necessary decisions,  rolled up your sleeves and got to work. For someone who has never run a speaker and content bureau before, you are working it like a pro!  Thank you!!!\n\n240#Departmental Security Review|Hi folks,  Thanks so much for taking part in our first departmental security review as part of our ISO27001 work.   We're looking forwards to using the results of the questionnaire as a way to increase the security alignment across the organization and we really appreciate the time and effort that people took in their responses!   best regards, Dermot\n\n241#Onboarding Partner!|Amy, thanks so much for helping with new hire onboarding today! Was so lovely to collaborate on the deck and talk through ways to streamline the talk track. Plus, its just fun to partner with you in general! Thanks for taking this time with an already very full plate, I appreciate you!\n\n242#Showcasing recognition at J&J|Team, thank you all so much for all your tremendous work in delivering a top notch Gratitude Summit for the Johnson & Johnson Global Educators.  This was a great opportunity to motivate their team, work to instill a culture of recognition, showcase what the Workhuman is all about and highlight the many ways Inspire has become a focal point for a number of their people activities.  Chris and Samar, you were both amazing partners at this event and I'm thankful to have had the chance to work with both of you.  The content you delivered was so well received and it was done flawlessly.  Your deliveries were just natural and free flowing.  It felt like a true conversation with their team.  Traci, once again you showed why you are just a true professional and expert in creating memorable content.  You are a story teller who has a feel for the audience and how we want to get the points across that will resonate at an event.  Thank you for your support and guidance as we were preparing for this session.  Amy, thank you for jumping on this opportunity with lightning speed and helping to make this session a success.  You seized the chance to get in front of this global team and we now have potential events to expand our connections with the J&J teams.  I am thankful to work with such an incredible group of professionals who excel at what you all do.\n\n243#Educating Global Education Leaders|Traci, Chris, Jay and Amy!!! What an amazing group of Humans who delivered an extraordinary and powerful session on the Power of Recognition and Gratitude for J&J's Global Education Solutions Group. The feedback from the J&J team has been phenomenal and we are already hearing from key stakeholders on \"how informative it was and how leadership wants to drive the empowerment of their employees.  Also the survey results are all 4.5 / 5 stars and above so far\". This outcome puts us in a super strong position for further collaboration and partnership as we continue to support J&J in charting a more work human course.\n\n244#Inspire-d!|Amy, when an educational group at a customer reached out looking for inspirational speakers, you did a wonderful job of pulling together the key account team members, collaborating with the coordinators on the customer side and helping organize the team, presentation and content elements to ensure everyone was fully prepared. We just left that session and it was a fantastic success. I just saw a note from one of the key sponsors saying that all of the survey results scored 4.5 or 5 out of 5. Thank you for all your help in not only making this happen but being respectful of the customer relationship and the team that services them as well. Thank you!\n\n245#Together We Can for J&J|Together We Can!! Together We Can!!! Let's scream and shout for Chris, Samar, Jay, Amy and Sarah who inspired and delighted the Global Educators Group at J&J today! Amy, when Jennifer Parungao from J&J's Global Educators Group contacted you about participating in their Learning Series and bringing recognition expertise to this session, you jumped on it with a YES!! From there, this WH team collaborated to create an amazing Action Series - Celebrate, Reward, Recognize and Engage session!   What a ROCK STAR session this was with over 150+ participants who were hanging on your every words - Samar, Chris and Jay - participating in the polls and behind the scenes sending text messages to our contacts telling them how inspiring the content is and jotting down the learning moments. After the session, loads of glowing emails from Sara Derousse SVP, Jennifer, and Philip wrapped up the sentiment of the audience \"Thank you! This was a team effort and again a huge thank you to Samar, Jay, Chris, Traci & Amy!  The content in your engaging presentation was relevant and amazing!  I was getting communications near the end and after of how informative it was and how leadership wants to drive the empowerment of their employees.  Also the survey results are all 4.5 / 5 stars and above so far.\" HIGH Praise and ratings for this session. Plus, they're eager to have us participant in future sessions! Sarah, thank you for your creative skills with the Zoom background that tied into the look/feel of the presentation slides and putting our WH stamp on what an extraordinary, engaging learning session looks like! I'm INSPIRED by you all and can't wait to see where J&J's program will go in 2021! You are shining examples of how human-centered companies are changing the future of work and the world! YOU ROCK!!\n\n246#Speaking of Speakers ...|Jill, Amy - fantastic collaboration and agility this week to secure two prominent personalities that will surely help us achieve our WHL goals. You effectively navigated the crooked and - at times - circular process that is speaker securement. I really appreciated how you acted with a sense urgency and definitiveness. Keep it going as we round out our talent for the event this upcoming week. -C\n\n247#Partnership|Amy - congrats on your newest hire! I'm so excited to have Reid joining the org, and wanted to take a moment to thank you for your partnership throughout this process. Your quick replies/actions and your active participation in the search made all the difference. It is always such a joy to work with you and I look forward to more opportunities to help you build out your amazing team!\n\n248#Supportive Leadership|Amy, Thank you so much for all of the support you provided to ensure a smooth internal transition for me. When you learned about the opportunity I had to get back into HR, you were understanding and onboard. In our subsequent check-ins, we discussed everything on the calendar, what I would see through and what you could begin to transition. We left each meeting with next steps, and were ultimately able to March 1 work - in large part due to your willingness to work together and determination to make it happen. I'm excited to continue my journey here in a new role, knowing that I will have the opportunity to collaborate closely with you and your growing team. And I am truly grateful for your support.\n\n249#THANK YOU FOR THANKING|Thank you all for your video submission for Employee Appreciation Day! While this day provides a wonderful reminder for all of us to reflect on the efforts and innovation that each of our humans bring to the table - we all know that our spirit of recognition and celebration is one that lives on all year long. There is no greater example of this in action than the recent call for video submissions from people leaders for an Employer Brand campaign. When we asked for some videos from people leaders thanking their team members, we were OVERWHELMED with video submissions - much more than we could incorporate into one or two snippet videos!  Your videos will remain live for all your team mates to see (see slack for link). Thank you all so much for taking the time to show your gratitude and enhancing our culture further. Even in this remote world you are all creating moments that matter, so thank you.\n\n250#Give and take|Amy - thank you for your candid conversations and perspectives. It helps me formulate my support for you and others. I appreciate our partnership and collaboration.\n\n251#Thank You for Making My Job Easy|In honor of Employee Appreciation Day (yes I am aware that none of you are \"employees\" of mine), I wanted to thank each and every one of you for not only making my job easier but making it fun. Working with you all is such a pleasure and together, we have created a strong foundation for our digital marketing initiatives. Thank you all for all the tireless work you do, and I am so exciting to keep building with you all.\n\n252#Creative discussion partners!|Team, thank you for your participation, creative discussion and investment in our process of defining Marketing KPIs as we envision our plan for development. I was inspired and motivated by your expertise and feedback during our session yesterday. This has truly been a team effort held up by all humans involved! I'm excited to see where our imagination and determination take marketing analytics.\n\n253#Energy + Passion = Contagious|You were on our eComm call today you did a presentation where your energy and passion for the brand is very apparent. Being a very new hire it was exciting to see and be a part of. Thank you!   Also, the notion of loud kids is something I relate to the core.\n\n254#Workhuman Listens|All,  It’s been such a pleasure to talk to you all over the past weeks, and to hear how much the voice of our customers matters to you! Over the coming months, we will help you create surveys to tap into the wealth of great things our users have to say about our products, how positive their experiences are… how they feel using the platform!! We have distilled the conversations we have had into a roadmap, which we will share with all of you next week. Over the past year, we, the EXM team, have seen some heartwarming testimonials from users, and I have no doubt that we are about to open the floodgates of thanks! I recall about a year ago, when we did our first proper ‘Periscope’ that the resounding response was a 72% ‘Just plain THANK YOU’  and the remaining 28% had some really encouraging and helpful feedback to offer, which we can use to make our product even better!!  All we need to do is listen!  I am excited to start working with you, and encouraged by your enthusiasm for the program.  Let’s build Workhuman listens!    Brian, EXM team\n\n255#Caring Matters!|Z and Amy, Thank you for organizing this Marketing team during our most recent meeting.  Everything was clear, the topics were key priorities and everyone participated.  And you demonstrated how you are about each of us. Thanks you for your exquisite leadership!\n\n256#Partnership|Amy, Thank you for your ongoing partnership with the customer acquisition team. Over the last few months, we’ve had multiple conversations ranging from how our teams can work together more closely, how to leverage PR and influrncers in specific markets, where agencies can plug in, what research we need and how to use it, and how to evolve demand gen to support new content directions. Not only do you listen and provide guidance, you take quick action to support the business. I’m grateful for your dedication to collaboration, alignment, and results!\n\n257#Team Data Grows|Adding more humans to the Thank you, for spending time this week outside of your current workload to provide data to help inform decisions for our future event work. I appreciate your time, dedication to teamwork, and quick responses. Cheers!\n\n258#The one with ALL the answers!|Amy, thanks (yet again) for dropping everything and helping me out in a pinch today. I was 100% sure you were heads down on many other key initiatives going on, yet we were able to figure out a solution to a mini fire drill in under 5 minutes. I know I can always count on you to either: A) have the answer I need, or B) happily offer to hunt down the answer in record time for us. I continue to be amazed by your contagious work ethic, your team-first mentality, and the speed you consistently operate at without sacrificing quality. Thank YOU!\n\n259#Right message. Right place. Right time.|Z, Amy, Moe! On behalf of Patti and myself, I wanted to highlight and say thank you for re-imaging our Marketing Communications approach. You correctly anticipated that what should follow our new brand reveal is a communication template that keeps in lock step with its style guide. Great example of cohesion, and pivoting to a more scannable, mobile friendly, info-graphic\"ish\" approach. Well done and thank you. With gratitude, -C\n\n260#Problem Solving Wizards|Thank you for all of your help solving the technical issues that can arise when working with media outlets.   I know that there are so many variables and details to manage when booking interviews on behalf of Eric.  Amy,  you are always there to jump right in to find solutions, work with our schedule, and be a trusted team member.  Thank you, Simone, for your ability to pivot and find creative solutions to making this process as seamless as possible.   Ray, thank you! You are always there any time, day or night.  It is such a pleasure to have you on our team to solve any problem, big or small, with a smile and a laugh.   It is such a pleasure to work with you guys, thank you for all your support.\n\n261#ONE TEAM.|Amy - Thank you for your partnership and collaborative approach. Every day your actions and words show your commitment and respect for ALL. You just reached out with a meeting request to a cross functional marketing group to proactively form a brain trust around WH IQ. \"How do we unlock all that good data and get ahead of it?\" Then I went to Slack and you had just shared an HR.com article with an interview with Steve P that you thought would be useful to our team. In our Monday standup yesterday, you took time to ask the right questions to ensure we were all aligned and properly supporting the Product Marketing on the upcoming Community Celebration launch. Not only are you clear, focused and confident, you are consistent with your ONE TEAM approach - and we'll be a better team thanks to all that you do. I see you and appreciate the positive impact you have on all of us.\n\n262#Rowing in the Same Direction|Thank you for always being strong advocates for Employer Brand! I appreciate you taking the time to review upcoming campaigns that are happening on the corporate side, and thinking about how Employer Brand can align to these themes as we engage our candidate audience - so our corporate and employer brands are both rowing in the same direction. As we look to make Workhuman a household name - aligning our messaging and themes when speaking to both prospective clients and prospective employees is essential for us to show the whole picture. Appreciate all you do!\n\n263#Team Updates|Amy - Quick note to say thank you for continually pushing us to be better, even with something like our team updates. You gave everyone a chance to weigh in on how we could improve the format and topics during our last meeting of 2020. Then followed up during holidays. And then, a third time, gave us a final chance to weigh in via. email during this first week back in the New Year. I know we're still semi transitioning to this new format but, it was a great first meeting of the year and I'm looking forward to testing out new ways of communicating. And making this year great with the best team ever!\n\n264#Vision, Clarity, and Collaboration...|Z and Amy - this award is long overdue. In the past several months, you both have taken the reigns on major marketing initiatives, goal planning, directors meeting agendas, leadership alignment... the list goes on and on. You've supported each of us by pushing ideas, clarifying objectives, and keeping us all focused in the same direction. This is the glue that holds all of our teams together, and helps our our marketing efforts (and ultimately our brand) become greater than the sum of its parts. This is NO SMALL TASK. And my words here don't do it justice. I'm writing this, on day 2 of the new year, where I'm already seeing a further increased level of clarity with our team meetings and objectives, and its so great to kick the new year off this way. Thank you both for everything you have already done, and will no-doubt continue to do.\n\n265#Putting in the work|Team - on behalf of Patti and myself, we wanted to say, \"Thank you\" and recognize the teamwork, collaboration, and effort you've collectively put in to moving our Pulse Survey action plans forward from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021. Together, we've made great quarter over quarter progress due to your efforts. This is an \"above and beyond\" initiative you've stepped up to lead. In doing so, you are each playing a leadership role for your marketing colleagues and peers - and - making a meaningful contribution to Patti and myself in building an amazing employee experience. This type of work is not the kind you can do \"every so often\" or \"sometimes\" and expect to achieve progress. It takes ongoing focus, a solutions-based outlook, courage and candor to build and sustain a great employee experience. Thank you for putting in the work - we look forward to continued advancements as we turn the page to 2021! With gratitude, -C\n\n266#Trailblazin'|“Our chief want in life is somebody who will make us do what we can.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson  Amy, as we wrap up the year I would like to recognize and thank you for our continued partnership.  I really like this quote, and while you don't MAKE me do anything, your perspective and guidance INSPIRES me to do everything I can to make an impact at this organization.  Thank you for the early opportunities to do cool video projects, current opportunities unfolding, and the unknown to take shape in 2021.  You make everyone around you better and I am grateful to be along for the journey.\n\n267#Dream Team|Team- what an incredible ride we have had this year!  When I think about all of the work we have done together, all of the groundwork we have laid, as a team, to create the iconic brand we know we are - I am in awe.  Each of you has stretched yourselves, tried new and intimidating tasks and responsibilities, and have never lost your grace and humanity. I am proud to work alongside you and to call you my friends.  Happy Holidays to you all.  Here's to an even better, out-of-this-world 2021!!\n\n268#The Holiday Spirit|Amy, thanks so much for organizing a team holiday (virtual) get together. I loved making the flower arrangements and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts through Christmas. Also setting up deliveries for 10+ people with all different goodies to go all over the state sounds exhausting! I appreciate you taking the time to tailor these fun surprises to each person plus the holiday activity. Thanks again and happy holidays!\n\n269#On Wednesdays, We Meet, We Talk, We Think, We Act.|And then we do it all over again the following week. I am grateful for your commitment to our Marketing Leadership call week in and week out. Sure, we might not have 52 weeks on the books for 2020, but we MOST DEFINITELY have twice that many hours and then some between our regular weekly meetings and our virtual offsite time together. Focus group of 1 here, but I find the time we spend together immensely valuable - hearing about what various teams are working on, gathering different points of view, discussing ways we can work better together, learning from each of you as subject matter experts and awesome marketers and humans...and last but not least, strengthening the connections between us even though we have been working apart since the early days of March. Enjoy a couple weeks off and we'll assemble again before you know it! THANK YOU!\n\n270#Have time for a phone call?|Amy, thank you so much for the amazing collaboration this week. With new folks on your team and an evolving content team; I was concerned about the 2021 goals and ensuring we keep momentum. No hesitation, you made time for a call during your morning routine time to collaborate together and walk through concerns, talk through different perspectives and offer some actionable next steps. Thanks for being so willing to partner and just talk it out, you are an awesome colleague and friend!!\n\n271#Continuing to set the standard for greatness|I wanted to thank all of you for the amazing work you've done honing our message and user experience on the Workhuman Certified website. As we move forward with this initiative we are gaining so many insights through our data collection and market testing, and having an agile team ready to respond to these learnings is vital to our success. Each of you has shined in so many ways under a tight timeline to get this site ready for re-launch, not to mention having a major holiday right in the heart of our development timeline!\n\n272#Grateful for all you do!|As this time of thanks rolls around, I wanted to express sincerest gratitude for you. Having worked together on recent projects I have seen how you go above and beyond for every task, which shines through the end results. Have a wonderful, happy and safe Thanksgiving. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you in the rest of 2020 and beyond!\n\n273#Fearless Captain|I am so thankful for your mentorship, leadership and direction. Things move quickly here and you're always available to answer questions, provide feedback and give guidance. I'm constantly learning new things from you and I am so grateful for everything you do. Thank you.\n\n274#Fearless Planning!|Z and Amy - thank you both so much for the amazing work putting frameworks from Patti and Chris into action in our marketing planning process. This has been an immeasurable amount of work, and being remote without whiteboards and flip charts makes it all the more difficult. You both have taken this on and helped us all prioritize and make the time, all while developing a process that keeps us engaged, collaborative AND productive! I'm so thrilled for the alignment and stoked to see what comes in 2021 as move into hypergrowth-mode. Cheers to you!\n\n275#Lights, Audio, Action on the Big Stage!|Kevin, Amy, Jenna, and Jon - the Brene Brown webcast is a tremendous win for all of us.  The stage this represents for our brand is global and beyond the walls of industry.  The conversation topics are so right on and do a magnificent job of telling our brand story, starting with our founder. There is no better B2B tech company on the market than us.  You and your teamwork are instrumental in paving the path to let everyone know what it means to Workhuman!\n\n276#Stepping up our PR game|Jenna and Amy, Amazing work in identifying 3 potential new PR agencies that can get us to the next level of brand exposure.  Your respect for urgency without losing your sense of value, perfection, quality, and raising our game is so appreciated. PR is the hardest of all Corp Comms jobs and it's only getting harder.   The two of you do the work of a team of 5. You help us learn and get better every day.  As a result, you are setting a solid foundation from which our brand will propel and excel.  THANK YOU!\n\n277#Boston Chamber of Commerce Rock Stars!!!|All, I just wanted to express my gratitude and extreme pride in our performance as a panel for the chamber’s All in For Advancement program.  I am always proud of WH but it never ceases to amaze me what superstars we have as employees, how we are all aligned in what we feel is important and the warmth and authenticity we bring when we describe our mission as a team.  Terrific work all!\n\n278#Congrats Workhuman Live Team!|Team – A HUGE shout out to each of you for helping deliver a fantastic event yesterday. It truly was amazing! Your hard work and dedication to excellence have set a NEW example for everyone in our organization. I’m inspired by the ingenuity and creativity of everyone’s contribution – planning, marketing, storytelling, vendor management, customer support, technical execution, and so much more. Your efforts have allowed us to create a new conversation in the marketplace. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to help every organization bring people closer together. None of this would be possible without YOU. I extend my heartiest congratulations on achieving a fantastic milestone. Well done ALL!\n\n279#I'm not scared anymore.|Let it be known your presence is real. I remember thinking...I'm kinda scared of her. Not sure why. Maybe it was your ability to be so calm when everything is chaotic around you. Now I realize that is who you are.....when the there are 50 things flying around...you trust your team to get it done. I love that about you. Thank you for all the strategy, determination, and thoughtfulness you put into so many projects, efforts, life.\n\n280#Office Hour Owners!|Amy & Jess, It's been so helpful to attend the recurring office hours you've both scheduled! Thank you for fielding everyone's questions (including a number from me:)) and ensuring we all have a good understanding of the book KWH book, WH Certified, and the new brand positioning! Love working with you both and look forward to continuing to see you at office hours!\n\n281#Leading the Way to Certified Launch|Where would Certified be without you, Amy and Brian? Not launched today, that’s for sure!   Heaps and heaps of gratitude to you from me and Melanie for making this the success we know it will be. We appreciate that you both took this project so seriously from the start, believed in what it could be (showed us just how big it could be at times), and poured your hearts and souls into it. You’ve worked tirelessly for months on this effort almost exclusively. For us, you’ve been anchors, guides and champions at every turn.   We imagine that taking a new product to market might normally be equal parts product and marketing. With the nature of Certified, it’s fair to say that the scales might’ve been tipped a bit in your direction. In truly unorthodox fashion, we even leaned on Marketing to help build part of the product itself, and you had the added nuance of stepping us through our first-ever go-to-market experience. I didn’t even know what GTM stood for when we started! We’ve both learned so much from you and it’s been an absolute pleasure sharing the journey. The volume of tasks you’ve managed, hurdles overcome, strategies brainstormed and executed, priorities juggled, stakeholders accommodated, and hours put in – too many moments, too much output to mention, where your immense talent and commitment made good things happen. You guys are really, really good at what you do. Workhuman and the Certified team are fortunate to have you.  This has felt like a true partnership where we’ve all been playing on the same team, aiming for the same win. We’ll miss our 8:00 am Tue/Thu routine (or maybe not?). Thank you for being a highlight of the experience for us! Congratulations, Amy and Brian, on the launch of Certified!\n\n282#GTM elevated to a new standard|Team, to say I am proud of each and every one of you for the work you did to bring Certified to market - well,  it would be an understatement.  In bringing this program to market, your commitment to success, to each other, and to our customers was visible. You drove never-before practiced approaches including taking integrated launch to a whole new level of collaboration and stakeholder management, you delivered incredible market research, a beautiful web experience, and so much more.  Congratulations to you.   I will miss our 8 am's!\n\n283#Great virtual offsite!|Thank you for planning and managing a great virtual offsite yesterday. I know you all invested a lot of energy into making sure it was a good use of our time, and you created a great agenda for the day. It was informative, productive, interactive, actionable, and fun!  Looking forward to the next one!\n\n284#Offsite virtually, but totally productive day IRL!|Team – Thank you for your active participation in our 2nd planning “virtual” offsite. The energy level was high and the level of engagement and strategic thinking was strong. Patti and I are excited about the united approach to not only long-term marketing planning, but building a strong culture for the entire Marketing team where different points of view are embraced and we are continually testing new ways of working to optimize our contributions to overall business results. I’m genuinely excited to build on this shared momentum to bring our 2021 plans to life. With gratitude – C.\n\n285#New hire tips that resonate|Amy- I just wanted to tell you, that you new hire tip the other day about getting dressed for your work day really stuck with me. One of the hard parts of coming out of maternity leave into a WFH world is that its been harder to feel like ME again - without getting dressed and out of the house, and socializing in the office. I never left the comfort of sweatpants, that comes from being on leave with a newborn. I've started to make more of an effort to trade in my sweats for jeans (pre-baby jeans that FIT!) and hoodies for cardigans recently, and I can definitely feel a difference. Thank you for inadvertently helping me navigate through the identity crisis that comes with becoming a mom!\n\n286#IBEC Diversity Forum|I wanted to thank you for taking the time to secure me a spot on the IBEC Diversity Forum. I know this can be very competitive, and I appreciate your support and endorsement. I 've already had my first meeting and chatted to key contacts. This was on my to-do list for 2020, as they have a great program with wide-reaching membership. Its a superb opportunity to showcase our thought leadership and innovation in this space. Thank you x\n\n287#Best bandmates, evah|Brian, Amy, and Brenda, thank you for your partnership and collaboration as we work to bring all the moving parts together with an aim to change workplaces for good with the launch of Workhuman Certified in less than a month. Day in and day out, through the multiple meetings, emails, slack messages and hard work, your respect for teamwork - and good natured laughs and smiles - are unwavering. I couldn't ask for better bandmates. Now, fingers crossed we've got a hit record on our hands!\n\n288#Momentum is Building!  Charter of Workplace Rights|Thank you all for your enormous contributions to making the Workhuman Charter of Workplace Rights a reality!   Over various starts (well over a year ago), pauses (CV-19) and re-directions, today was truly a unique moment where so much great progress and momentum was on display at our steering committee!    The logo, design standards, tone of voice, advertising styles, landing & welcome pages, application forms, why now, double clicks for more details by type, FAQ’s, links to the HUB, messaging live in the field being tested, a go-market-plan with dates set, 3 customers locked for interviews and certification celebration…and more!   On so many fronts, I see the momentum building and its building FAST!  This was always going to be a rush to the finish line as Covid upended all best laid plans!   But I sense we’re close… more to do yes, but a final push now, and we’re ready to start charging the world of work for good, and our societies will be changed for the better too.  Thank you all for your role in this important mission!\n\n289#Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine.|What a week!  You both did an outstanding job, against A LOT of odds, to get some really good national coverage last week despite so very many limitations.  Thanks to you, not only is our brand name getting more and more play, we are also learning a tremendous amount about where we can really start to maximize our story to break into the news cycle.  Go team!  We have only just begun!\n\n290#Setting up camp on the Moon|The biggest of shout outs to this group of badass teammates! Talk about taking Moonshots! Each of you came together to influence directly, support, and create an lane for us to present the WHCE movement directly to the most senior executives at some of our most influential customers. While we have certainly had opening in the enterprise communications groups at customers over the years, I believe this opportunity/offer to amplify their employee brand with Workhuman is being met in a very different way in 2020. The reactions at Board level executives is 'absolutely!'. While some of their calendars could not support the October timeframe, I believe they will be clamoring to participate in on-going events. We're going to have to start reading up on Beyond the Moon Shots! We have created incredible relationships with Executive Communications leaders through this process...relationships that will make us unstoppable. Thank you for your collaboration, support, all-in attitudes, and LEADERSHIP! To the Moon and Beyond!\n\n291#Do you sleep?|Amy, this appreciation moment is for you being a wealth of support at all times and hours. While I prefer not to Slack you or reach out after normal business hours, it happens and you’re always available. I greatly appreciate you taking the limited time you had today in between calls to walk through the flow of a deck with me only to rejoin the conversation once your calls wrapped for the day. Thanks for making the time.\n\n292#Supporting the AWS Analyst call|Thank you all for the support, answer edits and keeping me between the lines on the AWS Analyst call.\n\n293#Hello Workday!|Thank you for being an early adopter of Workday and for completing your scavenger hunt by the end of our first day officially live!!\n\n294#The book is here!|Thank you, Amanda and Amy for quickly connecting with me to get the word out to employees about the book being out in the world and ready to share. You both quickly reacted and helped get a message ready to share with employees. Many thanks to you, Amanda, for collaborating in record time and posting the news to employees. As you can see from the reactions, a happy bit of news that people were excited to hear! Thanks so much.\n\n295#Leading the way forward|Amy, your efforts around the Making Work Human book launch have been impressive to witness first hand! I admire what a good leader you’ve been as I was onboarded to the project, which was full steam ahead! This launch isn’t to be taken lightly. There are dozens of moving parts and you’re on top of it all! I googled what it means to be a good leader and felt this was very fitting for you. Thank you for continuously providing clarity, being decisive, keeping everyone informed, being responsive, putting your trust in myself and the team, and doing it all using good energy which fuels others in a positive way.\n\n296#7 Habits –Framingham Graduates –Class of June 2020|“MOTIVATION is what gets you started. HABIT is what keeps you going.\" - Jim Rohn.   To appreciate and recognise our Framingham based humans' commitment, hard work and valuable participation, please join me in congratulating each of them for investing in their personal development and successfully completing ‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People’ programme this week.  On a personal level, it has been a genuine privilege to have guided you all through this course and I wish to THANK YOU for your determination, innovation, collaboration and above all, the kindness you showed to one another and to me.  In turn you helped create and nurture a positive environment of trust and respect, where everyone’s uniqueness was truly valued.   Habit 7 - YOU are your single greatest asset so continue to invest in your 'Four Dimensions of Renewal' because when your Body, Mind, Heart and Spirit are nourished, all four will flourish!  Thank you FRAMINGHAM :) Donna\n\n297#Virtual Offsite - but 100% Productive IRL|Team - On behalf of Patti and myself thank you for a tremendous Q3 strategic planning and execution offsite last week. Both presenters and discussion partners excelled in their roles to communicate and strengthen existing plans. Your engagement and participation was locked in for the full session. And it's exciting to see this team rally around a new way of working that is oriented toward connecting business results to the strategic objectives of all our 2H initiatives within Marketing and across partner stakeholder teams. Thanks for leaning into the process - it's becoming a difference maker for us and helping us cut through our own noise! -C\n\n"
"298#\"Recognizing promise and progress\"|Teamwork makes the dream work. There’s no \"I\" in team. Together everyone achieves more. The cliches are all true! Brenda and I heartily thank you for your tremendous partnership these past several weeks as we worked through and finalized the go-to-market assessment and integrated marketing plan for Workhuman Certified. While a tough process at times, you all persevered to ensure we had the right answers to why are we doing this; why should others care; why now; and the most important of all: is what we are doing really ready for prime time? The three of you have truly been the driving force, asking the right questions, choosing the right words and setting us down the path for success. I know our work is far from over, but we’ve achieved a major milestone that will pave the way for so many other work streams to begin. Thank you your collaborative spirit and respect for teamwork. Brenda and I look forward to continuing this journey with you to help change the workplace for good!\n\n299#With colleagues like you...|Z, Amy, and Chris - thank you for your leadership, preparation, and delivery of the amazing first Marketing Leadership Team offsite.  The agenda, format, pace, and time keeping kept us all focused on what is important: cutting through the noise so we can grow our customer base, our share of wallet, and our brand. Your dedication to our team and our mutual and individual success is inspiring.  Thank you for all you do for us.\n\n300#Always willing to lend a hand!|Amy, you're always willing to make time to give advice, listen to ideas, help with questions and ensure we're putting our best foot forward. Your guidance is extremely appreciated and valued!\n\n301#You are Certifiably AWESOME!|Team, this award could be given under any one of the Workhuman values. Despite set-backs presented by COVID-19, the mixed levels of Workhuman institutional knowledge, and with the advent of new GTM and Integrated Launch approaches, each of you lended your passion, your insights, and your voice to the holistic GTM Assessment phase.   The world's best and most innovative teams truly do Workhuman!  Onward!!!!\n\n302#Yang to my yin|In Chinese Daoist thought, the yin and yang are used to think about how seemingly opposite forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent. The yin embraces the moon, the passive, the emotional, and creativity while the yang represents the sun, the active, the rational, and planning. In a workplace, yin is all about learning, knowledge, discovery, and playing with ideas while the yang is brilliant with establishing markets and putting strategy and structure in place. Working more closely with you over the past few weeks I've seen how critical you are to taking the ideas and putting them into a structure that makes sense. You are the yang to my yin and I’m truly looking forward to our continued partnership to take all the ideas and learnings to the next level.\n\n303#For supporting the IASA Web Summit|Thank you so much guys for all the help in promoting the IASA global conference. Public speaking at industry tech events is so important for everyone, and your support and guidance makes it 100 times easier.  Thank you for the social posts, the copy and all of the help and advice.\n\n304#Measurement for success|A bit late but I wanted to thank you all for your dedication, collaboration, and teamwork as we solidified measurements for Awareness, Perception and Preference. Learning and listening to each other through every meeting, I saw such great passion for accuracy and full transparency in the unknown. We worked together to present solid recommendations, and received great feedback. With our next steps to operationalize, use Q1-Q2 2020 as litmus on measurements, and prepare for QBRs together we'll create the best measurable Brand marketing we've ever had. I couldn't be more proud of this team.\n\n305#Listening Post|Amy, I wanted to recognize months of collaboration.  I know in your role as one of of the MSOs, you hear many voices every day. With that in mind, you take time to reach out and ask for input. (Even when you probably think I won't agree with you!)  I'm sometimes not the loudest voice in the room (call?) and sometimes I don't speak, even if I think I have something valuable to contribute.  As I continue to find my voice, your approach makes me feel valued, respected, and helps build the confidence I know I need to bring to everything I do.\n\n306#The future is now. The future is working human.|Team - this group has been the nucleus for \"what's next.\" You've ripped up and thrown away the rule book for what was. You've embraced the freedom, liberation and inspiration that comes from having a blank sheet of paper to operate from. Yes, we've been grinding the last two weeks, but we are on the precipices of exciting concepts that will propel our brand and business forward. Keep pushing, we're nearly there. With gratitude, -C\n\n307#Pioneers Unite!|Team - Thank you for your unyielding focus and energy in our \"first ever\" digital planning session for 2H '20 and Oct WHL-S initiatives. This was an epic-ly long virtual offsite that uncovered and unlocked critical new and innovative thinking for representing our solutions as \"essential\" and \"compelling\". Thank you for 100% commitment to this session and the ensuing outcomes. Lots of powerful thinking and actionable next steps to fuel our high growth, marketing making, and bleeding edge tech company and brand. With gratitude,  -C\n\n308#Smooooooth transition|Katie, Amy, and Dario - thank you for making the transition of paid social to Customer Marketing so seamless.  You came together to create a solid plan that sets us up for continued success and exponential growth.  Although our structure is now different, our opportunity to grow together and create magic in our market is better than ever before because of the three of you.  THANK YOU for all you do.\n\n309#Such a great partner!|Amy, thank you for looping me in early on the momentum press release and for getting me up to speed on all that was happening. You were a great collaborator with me in finalizing the internal comms plan to share the news. I'm thankful for your review, advice, and support in finalizing all the messaging. And, for all the laughs along the way!\n\n310#Press Coverage|What a great first week of the Momentum release! Congrats to you all for an incredible level of coverage and interest. It certainly feels like a real breakthrough in the Irish media. We’ve never had this level of recognition and depth of coverage. We also covered all the basis with meangingful coverage in all the right online and offline publications, subscription services and radio stations. Well done!\n\n311#Cutting through the noise|PR Team,  I am so proud of the work you have done for the transaction.  Your maturity, persistence, and commitment to excellence despite the many speed bumps and challenges that we know as the reality of PR, demonstrates perfectly that imagination, determination, and resulting innovation that is so critical for our amazing brand. The sky is the limit for what we can do together.  Thrilled with your work and honored to work with each of you!  Congratulations on a great release week!\n\n312#A to Z and back again|Amy - this has been a long time coming but I wanted to say thank you for your partnership. I value the collaborative relationship we've built over the last several months as we have linked arms to lay the foundational groundwork for our MSO functions. We still have a long way to go but I am grateful that I have the opportunity to be in this role with you by my side. It feels good to know you have my back and I have yours and when we can't both be involved in a meeting, project or task, we can count on each other to \"cover\" and run with it. I had a rough April with two major losses in my family and you were there for me...checking in to see not only how I was feeling but asking what you could take off my plate, insisting that I lean on you so I could heal. I can't tell you how much that meant to me. As we start to put more disciplined marketing planning in place, we constantly ask ourselves, how can we streamline the process, become more efficient, tell a more cohesive story, future proof our programs? I appreciate the iterative approach we're leading together and am genuinely grateful to have you as a partner and friend. Thank you!\n\n313#M-S-Oh ... My!|Amy, Z - Thank you for leading an outstanding Marketing Strategy and Ops discussion today. I know Patti and I are excited to have your leadership and organizing skill set to help drive transformation. By anchoring around KPIs, Key Initiatives, and a Prioritized Marketing Calendar you are helping us build necessary rigor and discipline to unlock the full potential of our world-class Marketing engine. Thanks for leading from the front. Excited about what's to come. With gratitude, -C\n\n314#Doing Great Things|Amy - There is so much I want to say in reflecting over the last two weeks of getting to work with you but, I will focus on this: YOU ARE AWESOME!! Thank you so much for taking the time to listen, to learn, and above all else to guide me in the right direction with a growth mindset. I've already learned so much from you and feel empowered to do things.. GREAT things that will take our social media presence to the next level while contributing to business objectives. Looking forward to the future and so grateful to have your support and leadership!\n\n315##WeWorkhuman|Amy, thanks so much for putting together an eventful team day on Friday. We started off with a strategic meeting to align on priorities and metrics as a newly formed global comms and social media team. We ended the day with a (global) scavenger hunt that allowed us to get outside. With kids, parents, and pets in tow we discovered and shared our most scenic views and more. During my adventure, I even found a community garden that I had no idea existed. I guess that’s what happens when you get outside and explore! On behalf of the entire team, thanks for an impactful day!\n\n316#A calendar a day...|... Might not keep the doctor away, but does help us be organized as a leadership team! Amy, Z - thank you for being relentless in your pursuit of our shared marketing calendar for town hall today. This is the critical example of discipline and organization we need to accelerate progress and balance smart trade offs in the ever-evolving market we exist - thank you for leading the way and setting a great example for the team. With gratitude, -C\n\n317#Valuable Leaders Share Knowledge|Amy, I wanted to say thank you for all of the knowledge you've shared with me over the last few months. Even as we transitioned to remote working, you never missed a beat to identify areas where you can lend support. You’ve taken my 6:30 p.m. calls to help review work even though that’s vital time with your family and girls. You have shared media interview tip sheets and training so I can ensure important conversations stay on track around our messaging and main points. You always keep an eye out for interesting speakers and call for papers forms to send to me. There are too many examples to list but thank you for always sharing your knowledge and experiences so that we can all continue to grow.\n\n318#Telling a Cohesive Story!|Amy and Z - wanted to thank you both for the great work you do each week to roll up the director updates into a thoughtful and cohesive story for Chris and Patti to share with the larger leadership team. It's not easy taking all that content and weaving it together quickly and efficiently; making it look easy!!!! Thank you for all you both do!\n\n319#Shepherding Thank You Healthcare|Amy - You have done a wonderful job steering the Thank You Healthcare program, developing cross-functional plans with all of our marketing stakeholders. The program has been a unique one, targeting consumers for the first time in Workhuman history! This has not deterred you and you see the opportunity in every turn. Thanks for your leadership!\n\n320#Supporting external speaking engagements|Amy and Rob. Thank you both so much for the support you have given in both presenting and helping prepare me for external speaking engagements in the last month, both with Atlantec Festival and the upcoming opportunities in Dublin.\n\n321#Fierce commitment to urgency|\"We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there IS such a thing as being too late. This is not time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.\" - MLK JR.   Team, since I started just over a month ago, I have heard from many of you and our stakeholders who have talked about the misfortune of joining Workhuman during a global pandemic that has changed every thing about how we live: from how we interact, to what we spend our time and money on, what we value, and how we work.  The truth is, there was no better time for me to be able to witness the magic that is Workhuman. We already know what is important and that is human connection. What you have demonstrated is humanity during a time of extreme urgency - a rarity in life and certainly in business. Thank you for your passion for your and your commitment to each other and our stakeholders.  I am honored to work alongside each of you.\n\n322#Moodtracker Launch success!|Team – Thank you for delivering our brand new Moodtracker product. Thank you so much to everybody for the amazing work on the Moodtracker product. Hard to believe this was just an idea at the beginning of January. Since then a team has formed, the product designed, architected, built, tested, branded, communicated, marketed and launched. Whew. The speed at which the groups collaborated is a tribute to the sense of camaraderie and positivity we have at Workhuman. The energy, imagination has shone through in every way. This coupled with the determination to deliver a world-class product means that today we have a sixth edition to our Workhuman Cloud suite. Welcome Moodtracker. On behalf of all of the humans in the company, thank you. Eric.\n\n323#The Social/PR Powerhouse behind Moodtracker GTM|Amy, Jenna, Katie, Holly, Max, Roshni and Dario, this was my first chance getting to work with a lot of you, and I can’t thank you enough for the amazing work you’ve done getting our message out to the world for Moodtracker and the Workhuman Livestream post event strategy. I feel like I learned a lot from each of you about the process and best practices for getting these ads into market on a variety of platforms, and I’ve been so impressed with your creativity and professionalism during these campaigns. I know this is only the beginning, but I can’t wait to see what we’re able to pull off in the weeks to come!\n\n324#Our Survey Says - You are Fantastic!|Colleen, Amy & Niall, I wanted to thank you all for all of the support you gave me recently with my dissertation research. I really appreciate you taking the time to review the survey, it was great to get all of your input, and and I'm really thankful for all your help in getting this approved. Thanks again :)\n\n325#Leadership, Guidance, Support|Amy - I am grateful for your leadership, especially over the past weeks. Thank you for checking in with me every week and for bringing the team together to make sure we all stay aligned. You've managed to keep us all informed as priorities shift, you've kept it real and kept it positive - which I appreciate. Most recently, you provided helpful guidance to help me navigate a couple of challenges I was facing and provided a helpful bigger picture as well. I know it can't be easy leading others while balancing so many big initiatives, but you've stepped up to that challenge and I'm so appreciative. Thank you!\n\n326#Making us stronger together - every single day|Team - what a week! I am blown away by your collective and individual innovation. These are the experiences that can give us the best learnings and insights - not only in terms of skills, but more important, learning just how much awesomeness we are capable of bringing to the world. Thank you. Onward!\n\n327#All systems go!|This group rallied mid week in an incredible pivot from soft launch to just LAUNCH within hours. I cannot thank you enough for the commitment to urgency for launching media campaigns.\n\n328#Quick Response Team!|Amy, Dianne and Lauren - thank you all so much for your quick work helping out with some content for the customer launch of Thank You Healthcare! You all have the fullest of full plates and still sprung into action to help the customer team. The content for the message was excellent and just what we needed to help the team get messages out quickly. You are all awesome teammates!\n\n329#Lifting us all as you rise|Without batting an eyelash, you both jumped in with your hearts, your brains, and your brawn to create an integrated plan to help us elevate the spirits of the healthcare community while giving each of us an opportunity to share our deepest thanks.  Watching you each lead, bring out the best in each other and the rest of us - it is a thing of beauty that is making a huge difference.\n\n330#A Warm Welcome and A Supporting Hand|Amy, thank you for all you've done in the past couple weeks. You've answered every one of my questions, helped me prioritize activities and gave me space to complete onboarding. Even though starting a job from home isn't ideal, you've made sure I'm in the know and connected to the all the right people and are doing a great job supporting me as I navigate this new role. I could not be happier to work for you.\n\n331#Checking In, Checking Success!|Amy, Dan, and Katie - Every morning at 9 since we've been at home due to COVID-19, we've checked in together with our video calls.  You've shared not only amazing ideas and suggestions but also worries and concerns as we navigate so many interesting paths as a company, culture, and team. Thank you for your willingness to be so open, as it's a critical ingredient for trust and ultimate success.  And boy, has there been success!  Incredible achievements across PR, content, and social.  Anyone looking at our social feeds can see your work and leadership on a daily basis and see how it's propelling our brand and company higher and higher. Thank you for all of your work (and teamwork) as we continue to show how Workhuman can help elevate human connections across the world!  Kevin\n\n332#X-Team GTM Collaboration Success|If you would have asked me at the beginning of March if we could bring a new product to the market in a few weeks I would have laughed. If you told me we'd all be doing it remotely because of a global pandemic I would have told you that you were crazy. Despite all the challenges this team was able to rise to the occasion and do what I would have thought was impossible. Coordination is always challenging, but this team managed to do it all in sweatpants (I hope we've all given in) on Zoom, which is remarkable. Thanks for the amazing work team!\n\n333#Delivering the Human Touch|When the COVID-19 pandemic began to accelerate, our marketing instinct immediately went to providing a human face on our content. There is no more powerful thought leadership than humans speaking with humans – sharing experiences, emotions, and best practices on how best to craft a path forward in these unprecedented times. That was the inspiration for the daily video series, “Keeping Work Human,” which launched last week amid the flurry of everything else we are working on. James and Matt – you stepped up and deftly handled the logistics of turning a Zoom video conference call into usable, shareable video. Pam – you project-managed the overall logistics, setting up the invites, and showing agility when we had to pivot. Amy – you immediately energized your team to schedule guest speakers. Mike – you were at the ready to transition the videos to Workhuman Radio podcasts. Sarah and Jess – you stepped up to write the question frameworks and provide a content resource. John and Diane – you saw what was happening and introduced better discipline and process. Jen – you were our first guest and dazzled our viewers with unique leadership best practices to manage remote teams. And Steve – our host – your ability to set the tone, and keep our guests at ease with your authenticity and humble heart, is what makes it all work. We’ve only just begun – and we have a busy few weeks ahead – but I couldn’t be prouder of this team and the messaging we are bringing to market.\n\n334#It’s a Balancing Act|Amy, I wanted to shout out your incredible leadership during these ambiguous times. I’m not sure how you fit as many meetings into the day as you do but at the same time you’re helping to keep the rest of us afloat. You took the time to understand how each of us prefers to communicate and receive feedback prior to the COVID-19 crisis. This started with “how I like to work” probing questions you provided to the team as early as Ignite. Fast forward to now where remote working is the standard but luckily we’re not starting from scratch. I feel 100% supported and in the loop on all new projects even if I’m not directly involved. You’ve checked in daily to get a pulse on my workload and how I’m feeling in general. While these are challenging times for everyone, it also brings out the best attributes in people. Thank you for your support, transparency, and leadership. You’re a master balancer of all the things!\n\n335#It's Go Time!|Team - I wanted to first say thank you for your rapid response to the business's need for a COVID rapid response campaign. I also want to acknowledge that working at this pace and with a level of uncertainty may be new and/or uncomfortable, but that has not stopped this group from leaping into action, mobilizing, and being agile and responsive to rapidly evolving priorities - including stopping existing work, pivoting planned content, and being open-minded about new ways of working team together and team apart (as we leverage remote technology for the next while). Still lots to do, and I'm confident with the cohesion demonstrated this week we will do great things that help our current and future customers navigate uncertain times and that we will unlock new approaches and agility as a cross functional team. Thank you all. With gratitude, -C\n\n336#A tough day, a great team|Each one of you exhibited all of our values today but I chose Respect for All because we had a lot of decisions today that required us being in agreement and with a path to move forward very quickly and everyone did it in a respectful, efficient way. This was not a fun meeting - we all love WHL and are dedicated to it being perfect. Today, though we were taking it apart, was no exception. Everyone concentrated on the right message for our audience, thoughtfully went through all affected segments, and delivered a great plan. I'm so proud to work with each one of you and hope we are back together very soon planning '21!\n\n337#Team Corona|Coronavirus.  Covid-19.  A giant headache.  We all call it something different – especially because the situation with it has been changing minute by minute and making our decision making process so challenging.  When we made the decision to create new content and FAQ’s for our Workhuman Live site and audiences at 8PM on a Friday night, I crossed my fingers we would be able to activate.  We needed to get information out to our audiences that was clear, consistent, and valuable to ensure they felt informed and at ease.  No surprise – every single one of you stepped up.  Dianne was slacking me almost immediately with project set-up details and timelines.  Lauren had copy in my hands before 6:00 AM (you actually sent it at 1:30!?!)  Chris and Amy were both there to review, edit and get on the phone to talk it through.  Jon had site pages staged and new pop-up functionality built and staged Saturday morning.  Jen and Anthony had layouts and content ready to deploy.  Jill was providing copy strategy and reviews.  Holly and Anne were standing by ready to act as needed for our audiences.  And Lauren – our guiding light and champion of strategy supporting the whole process was as responsive as ever with reviews and feedback.  This is such an evolving and fluid situation, but the team never ceases to amaze me.  You gave up family and weekend time to help ensure our customers had the information they needed, when they needed it.  Your continued dedication and respect for customers, urgency, quality, and teamwork is amazing.  Thank you – and Cheers to Team Corona.\n\n338#First Class Collaboration|Team! I wanted to say congratulations and celebrate the collaboration that infused our FY20 Marketing Strategy Board. As of this past Friday we have an aligned, crisp, and clear plan for Marketing's focus and KPIs that sits perfectly between the Company's goals, objectives, and major priorities. I also want to recognize the diligence that went into to making this be a plan that effectively spans Customer + Brand Marketing and reflects alignment with our key partners (SLT, CS, CX, and Finance). It is metrics driven to ensure accountability and through it's more streamlined nature, now infinitely more shareable with our teams and partners. Look forward to rolling this out to the teams through all hands these next two weeks and continuing to revisit it for focus, alignment, and relevance to the business's needs as our business evolves. Love to see the positive momentum and teamwork modeled to produce this output - lets keep it going. With gratitude, -C\n\n339#Action and a Plan|Z, Amy - I wanted to recognize your rapid response to the needs of the business and the people needs of our marketing team. The new approach you brought to our wkly Dirs+ meeting was powerful. I found it to be agenda-driven, aligned with our FY20 goals, and hyper-focused. Thank you for quickly evolving away from \"old ways\" of doing things and demonstrating leadership around taking a new approach while being open to feedback and continuing to iterate as we fine tune the format. Keep up the great work - it's making a difference that matters. With gratitude, -C\n\n340#Now that... is a meeting|Amy and Z - I am so impressed by the work you both have done to get our directors meeting into a really great place. We had an awesome agenda, kept on time, the team was focused and we all walked away with good info. Collaboration at its finest. Thanks so much for taking this on and making it the best meeting I have had all week! Cheers to you both!\n\n341#Last minute ask|On top of your day jobs, I asked each of you to present in our weekly marketing directors+ meeting today - without a ton of notice. You produced slides, shared great content, and kept the team engaged during your sessions. Thank you for embracing the new format for our weekly meeting which we tried for the first time today, and contributing to what felt like one of our best meetings to date!\n\n342#Helped me find my voice, quite literally!|Publishing my first article in Forbes was big moment for me and ironically, all the things I shared quite literally were a part of how this came together. Amy, thanks for the steady push to share my voice. You have been a staunch supporter guiding with a firm yet gentle hand. Lynne, you got the ball rolling, talking with me, helping make sense out of my myriad thoughts and seeing a story, putting them in writing in a great cohesive way. Dan, you steadily provided guidance and resources. Dave, you leaned in immediately when you heard my frustration, rolled up your sleeves and channeled my voice through rounds 4, 5 and 6. Sarah, you are just magical with your editing style. You took version 6 and over the weekend edited for crispness and polished in a way that made me feel eloquent and clever. I am grateful for this agile team that came together to ironically help me find my voice in print! Thank you all for helping me take my own darn advice: taking that first step. Here's to many more!\n\n343#November 21, 2019|Assuming Outlook is accurate, November 21, 2019  was our first official \"Marketing Directors meeting.\" Sixteen weeks later, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank each of you for ALLLL the time and energy you've invested in our time together. We've been meeting on a weekly basis  to establish more visibility, create more alignment across functional teams, collaborate on short and long term planning, negotiate budgets, brainstorm core marketing themes, discuss better ways of working together...the list goes on an on. And while I know we all cringe at the thought of another meeting on our calendars when we are starved for time, I strongly believe if we come together on a regular basis and focus on the right things, we'll all be smarter for it. I have so much gratitude for each of you! Thank you and see you next Wednesday!\n\n344#Thought Leadership Excellence|It’s one thing to discuss thought leadership and it’s another to deliver it – which each of you has done with editorial aplomb. “The State of Humanity at Work” not only showcases results of a provocative survey of 2,613 full-time workers, but takes the data and brings to life some of the uncomfortable issues that companies are facing in the new decade. Core human needs like safety, fair pay, work-life harmony, growth, inclusion and belonging, and recognition are covered here – with startling results.  Sarah – your storytelling ability is outstanding, humanizing the data in a way that brings the issues to life. Greg – our resident Einstein – your data-carving skills and guidance to ask the questions in the right way set the tone. Carrie – your design ability is always worth pointing out. The report is simply elegant. And Amy – you had the idea to go beyond the annual report and deliver research in time for Employee Appreciation Day – leveraging our agency to augment internal efforts. Well done to each of you and thanks for your commitment to outstanding thought leadership.\n\n345#Constructs for success|A few weeks ago we took on a herculean task, gathering a small cross-functional team to create a rubric for consistent messaging heading into 2020. 19 core narratives, from themes to products, and the building began. Each of you played a part, both large and small and we are off to a such a strong start! Next steps are culling these down even more to get them over the finish line but I couldn’t have done any of this without your help and support. GO TEAM!\n\n346#Interview dream team|A sincere THANK YOU to all of you for your participation in interviews over the past few months, for our Director of Product Marketing. Someone of you met with 5 candidates - which adds up to a LOT of time out of your schedules. Some of you only met with a couple of finalist candidates, but helped us to wrap up the search and make important decisions about who we were hiring. Overall, you all were so responsive, flexible, open-minded and just a pleasure to work with throughout this process. Thank you so much for the part you played in getting this fill across the finish line!\n\n347#Umbrella gratitude|Thank you all so much for your collaboration with our Dublin based Umbrella project. From the messaging to the design, you were always there to help and enthusiastic to lend a hand wherever needed. Thank you all.\n\n348#HIRED!|Amy - thank you so much for your partnership on the PR Manager search! It took longer than we anticipated, but I so appreciate your flexibility, candor, and timeliness throughout the entire process. You were always quick to reply which is so important in a tough market like Boston - and you were always quick to offer words of encouragement - even when things weren't going our way. Thanks for sticking it out with me, and congrats on your new hire!\n\n349#The dream team does it again|Before too much time gets away from us, I wanted to thank each of you for your incredible work on Ignite Dublin. Within one week there were a LOT of moving parts. LIKE... TONS. And never did this team flinch. Everyone stayed focused, helped in any way possible and kept on top of those million details to deliver an incredible event (with handwritten notes being adjusted just in time... I'm looking at you Mrs. Grady!). Such an awesome undertaking and I loved working with you all on it!\n\n350#High Scores for Content|Amanda & Amy, during today’s Evanta lunch & learn, the representative from Gartner showed a slide that shows Workhuman speakers at Evanta events score higher than their average session score. That shows firsthand that the messaging and presentations you're putting together are truly resonating with the c-suite audience. As always, great work!\n\n351#Great panel questions!|Thank you so much for your excellent questions for the panel.  Very thoughtful questions each, thank you for representing the audience so well!\n\n352#MSO for the win!|Amy & Z - Thank you for taking ownership over the Thursday Marketing meeting. Under your guidance, the meeting went from scattered and jumbled to organized and productive. I appreciate you both stepping up to drive the agenda and the meeting!\n\n353#Certifiably Great Marketing Deck|Amy - great job on your work around the marketing plan for Workhuman Certified. An initiative involves a great many ideas and people. It also involves strategic thinking - with an eye towards what will be most impactful for the business. It also involves pushing for the right elements and ensuring alignment across a team.  It can often seem like an uphill climb but the progress is quite evident to all involved in the project. There are great things ahead in the market.  Thank you for all your efforts!\n\n354#Content team rockstars|Can you be our team on every project? Seriously, MJ and I had the dream team of collaborators when it came to working on the content for our ambitious agenda. Amanda – we really don’t know how you do it, you’re some magical unicorn of creative genius mixed with speed and quality, and always quick with a smile and a joke to keep us all humming along. You created the on-screen visuals for a huge portion of the event. From all of Derek’s material to the awards, and both Alice and Jesse’s presentations, you were a force! Thank you for the incredible work. Amy, Clare, and Kristen – a huge thank you for being there at every turn with “how can I help?”, “what can I do?” and then making things happen. From helping select and assign panel questions to supporting our main stage speakers and breakout session leaders, creating and delivering desk drop surprises, and sharing great feedback on the event, you played a critical role in what was a great couple of days in Boston. Next, on to Ireland! Thank you for everything!\n\n355#Taking the workhuman rocket to new highs!|Amanda, Colleen, Mary Jo & Amy, I am fortunate and proud to work with you this past few weeks.  Congratulations on the part 1 of 2, great success that you delivered in Boston this week!   You were the foundations to my presentation and mc work.  Without your guidance, direction, ideas, detailed content, slides, notes, cards…. I certainly could not have done it!  With great appreciation for being right there at all the stages (sitting beside me too!), it’s a real honour to work with such professionals, and a high performance team as you all are.\n\n356#Keeping marketing leaders on task for 2020|Amy & Z - Shout out for shepherding the marketing leaders along the 2020 planning process. It's hard to create a format which can fit everyone and everything we do. There are always nuances. But you listen to feedback and make wise decisions as to what is needed and what is not needed to build a well-structured plan. This is especially difficult since there are 2 new VP leaders on the horizon. You've stepped in to fill the need!\n\n357#Hidden Heroes, Team Focus|All - I wanted to thank you for all of your collective work on an upcoming keynote announcement for Workhuman Live 2020. I greatly appreciate your focus and diligence to getting the package complete and ready for speaker approval. As we all know, approvals can often take more time than we'd like - but your ability to get this package done in a timely and high quality way is amazing. Well done to all of you and thank you for your efforts. Can't wait to see it out in market!\n\n358#A New Horizon|Thank you for taking the lead to get us together in Dublin, updating us on the latest thinking as to how the brand strategy is evolving, and for exploring opportunities for how we capitalise on that in the local market. We are big supporters of the work you and your team are doing, and keen to be advocates for brand alignment. Thanks also for turning us into fantasy characters, in order to build new skills and awareness.  I really appreciate the trust and openness you show towards us, and how you listen to our needs, which incorporate the local market, and the cultural differences between Ireland and the US. I'm very excited about the potential and benefit to be derived from stronger partnership between the Marketing and Technology teams.\n\n359#What we are all about|Amy,  from Oran, Niall, Rosana, Rob, Shane and myself- \"THANK YOU\" for today.   Your session was informative, insightful and very helpful.   You took what could have been a tough topic and helped make it fun and engaging.  I have never seen such active participation in role play :) and it is attributable to the quality of your training.  We are all incredibly glad that you practiced to your taxidriver audience,  despite him almost driving you to an alternate venue where you might receive the help you need :) I leave you with famous words(slightly altered)  that sum up how we all feel  \"...Watch and you'll see....Some day we'll be....Part of your world\"\n\n360#Perspective|Amy - I wanted to let you know that I value your support in helping to develop the next wave of leaders here at Workhuman. You have taken many people under your wing (both at the direction of the HR team and on your own) and provided them with a valuable lense on the organization, how to manage through it, operate in it, and how to grow themselves. Even though this work is focused on developing others it does come with learnings for you as well, both good and bad. The work you're doing is important. Keep it up.\n\n361#Giving it your all|Amy - I’m recognizing your for all the work you put into this year’s holiday card email. From the initial brainstorm, to charities, to expanding this year’s card beyond customers only, to gathering feedback from Alice, Kevin, Kristen, Eileen, Pam, Jill, Mark, Anthony, Stacey, and the list goes on and on to ensure the execution covered all parties appropriately. We realized the benefit of versioning it out for prospects and set it up through Yesware for reps to send individually which allowed them to personalize it just as customer success did the year before. The customer list needed to be reviewed and cleaned up and you stayed right on top of it! You shared feedback from the reps about how great their experience has been utilizing the email rather than handwriting cards that people throw away. This is a gift that keeps on giving! Thank you for truly owning this and working so hard to make sure it went off without a hitch!\n\n362#Bite-sized marketing updates, Buffet-sized results|Great job all on your collective sharings and updates during our full marketing team meeting this week. There is so much goodness happening in marketing right now and each of you showcased the strategic thinking, approach, and results in a very concise way. And...you also stayed on time! This shows how each of you respect each other and the full marketing team. It also ensured that everyone had an opportunity to share their work and create greater alignment across the entire group.  Thank you!\n\n363#28 this quarter!|28 humans. That's how many people assisted in one way or another with the Q4 year-end, last meeting of the decade and for each and every one of you, I am grateful! It's pretty incredible to think about the village that comes together to make this meeting happen. From confirming our speakers, creating slides, providing content, answering my many questions, testing and testing and testing (yes, 3x) the technology to provide a great experience for all, to ringing the gong - each of you receiving this award was integral to the overall success of the meeting.\n\n364#Tech champions support|I am deeply grateful for the support I received from each of you in preparation for speaking at Dublin Tech talks Meetup recently. From help with slides, distilling the many topics in my head down to something digestible, to help with my LinkedIn profile..You made a huge difference. Thank you\n\n365#You did it!|Earlier this week, our speaking proposal was accepted for the 2020 Recognition Professionals International (RPI) Conference. While that might seem like a no brainer to some, for years, the style and message of the conference didn't fit our brand, so years ago we stopped going. Chris & Corinne, you both kept it on your radar, and listened when future customers talked about it, and pitched reasons for us to relook at going. You both committed to do field research, and came back with feedback that not only should we have a presence there, but we should be speaking. Amy, you openly took in their feedback and experience and pursued it, put the the presentation proposal together with Corinne committing to speak and here we are, Success! Each of you maintained an open mindset for change and went the distance to make it happen, Congratulations!\n\n366#The value of leadership|Amy, while selecting the value for this award, I was wishing there was one specifically around leadership, because that’s the one you deserve. I’ve been waiting to write this recognition for some time because it’s been clear in the months after your return just how impactful, insightful, and inspirational you are as a leader, colleague, and friend. You approach every project with a strategic lens, logic, calmness, and humor. You intrinsically see where people’s strengths are, what value they can add, and you empower them to do it with a mix of resolve, positivity, and kindness that’s truly motivating. To say I’ve enjoyed working with you and benefitting from your guidance would be a gross understatement. You are, in a word, a powerhouse. And this place is so lucky to have you as one of its leaders. Thank you for all you do.\n\n367#For some amazing hand holding, prep and more!!!|Amy, you are an amazing partner in all of our outreach and I certainly have leaned on you these past weeks.  You have all the details to hand and are always a consummate professional.  I am extremely grateful that you are part of our team!  Thank you!\n\n368#2020 Digital Prep|Amy - Thank you for taking the time to meet with me to discuss the Digital/SEO/External Comms strategy in 2020. It was a great conversation, and it gave us both action items to accomplish goals both in the short term and deeper into the new year.  With what we were able to in just a few short months in 2019, I know we'll be able to raise Workhuman's web presence even more so in 2020.\n\n369#For a LinkedIn 101 1 on 1!|Hey guys. Thank you so much for the work with me on the thought leadership platform. It has made a tremendous difference and it is so reassuring to have experts like you both as supports as I navigate Social Media 101 material\n\n370#For lending an ear|Amy, thanks for taking the time to touch base not just today but on a weekly basis. Upward and onward!\n\n371#MA Conference for Women|Hi Amy - thank you so much for stepping in and helping with the Mass conference for Women while I'm out with the baby. Through every twist and turn over the past week, it's been great to have a rock like you available to pinch hit, and keep everything running smoothly. Thank you!\n\n372#A True Global Content Team for Executive Forums|I wanted to commend all of you for your teamwork and diligence chronicling the key insights and learnings from the executive forums in the fall.  These insights are an important element for our ability to continue our thought leadership and communication touch-points with this high level audience. It will also help us internally - to ensure we - as a collective team - are out in front of emerging HR and people trends. Special shout-out to Sarah for the writing of the whitepaper (the final version which is coming soon!) and Dan for his foresight and strategy behind the people coverage of the forums, ensuring each one had a content lead to roll-up into the whitepaper output.\n\n373#Cyber Monday!|As I sit here looking back on the past 2 ½ days, I am in awe at what this team has just pulled off.  It's one thing to think about rolling out a massive multi-day / multi-touch / multi-channel campaign with weeks of planning … but we decided to do so much more.  In just these 2 ½ days, we have managed to launch housing to all audiences, which included segmented email deployments, multiple site updates, platform updates, rebuilding every confirmation email, design, social, and more!  Buy why leave it at that?  We also pushed out the Justify your Trip content.  Custom letters by audience, site updates, design changes, functionality tweaks.  And even took the time to redesign and rebuild Eric’s Keynote page.  On top of all this – Cyber Monday went out the door today.  I started doing the math on the executional elements we have for this one campaign, but ran out of fingers, toes, and strands of hair to count on.  We basically crammed week’s worth of work into just two days, like it was nothing.  But it was everything!  This was no small feat, and every one of you played a role in pulling it off (almost) seamlessly.  The results are not in (yet), but this could not wait because we have completely set ourselves up for success thanks to all of you.  I so appreciate your focused commitment to the success of Workhuman Live.\n\n374#Interview Prep|Thank you so much for the interview prep sheet for our Irish Times interview this morning. It was so great to have all the numbers, customers and announcements to hand for quick reference! Of course, in the actual interview it veered into all manor of topics, but having the brief enabled me to quickly get us back on track! Well done and Thank You!\n\n375#Thanks to the data nerds|Thank you to everyone on this award for taking time to review questions and provide input for the upcoming full-time U.S. employee survey. What started out as a \"mini\" survey outside of the annual international survey has turned into quite a robust assessment of the employee experience in the U.S. We're tackling some sensitive issues such as harassment and discrimination and I really appreciate the thought each of you put into additional questions and answer options and getting the wording just right. I'm looking forward to seeing the results come in and using this data to build a compelling report that will drive leads and media inquires.\n\n376#Great experience!|Just wanted to thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to arrange time for me to get to observe and experience what you guys do on a daily basis. I was only in the Framingham office for a short period of time but I feel like I've obtained and learned a lot which is so beneficial to me. Your knowledge, talent and overall dedication to your work is extremely evident, thank you for the experience\n\n377#Team creativity|Thank you for your help collecting and sharing insightful, relevant information for our Q4 customer acceleration meetings.  With your contributions, we were able to identify marketing opportunities and generate new ideas for delivering value to these important accounts.  Looking forward to continued collaboration and the wealth of innovative ideas that will result!\n\n378#Finance work|Amy, thank you for all the creativity and passion you are bringing to helping us pursue the finance persona.  Whether it is the executive finance event, team briefings or market testing of messaging, you are at the forefront leading the charge. This is a new area for us and requires the courage to try new things, be bold and basically operate completely out of our comfort zone at all times.  But that is the kind of effort required to change the world.  We have to always do things that have not been done. And we have to take risks.  I wouldn't say endure failure but rather learn from all our experiments.  Bravo for stepping up to take on this challenge and for helping us learn a new approach.  So far so good!\n\n379#NewCo Lighthouse|Thank you for giving me and Christina the opportunity to run with the NewCo event and playing a role in building up our relationship with Mass TLC. Through planning this event we’ve been able to build and strengthen relationships with different departments, while getting to experience how to be more successful with these types of events in the future. Your guidance on execution and recommendations of who and what to tap into helped to give us the confidence we needed to pull everything off! Thanks for your strong leadership, your confidence, and your support!\n\n380#GPTW Ire|Maeve and Amy, Thank you both for your help getting me the information on our top media pieces in Ireland and all of the great speaking engagements we've had this year. This information is going to be a great addition to our interactive submission this year, showing how we've raised our profile in the market! Thank you so much for your quick and thorough help.\n\n381#Campaign and Testing Progress!|Incredible job with your recent presentation on our campaigns.  Amy – as the quarterback you have displayed great agility, fine-tuning and advances our approaches, new test ideas, and more. We are in the midst of a transformation within marketing – from both a conceptional and executional standpoint. You were able to show the progress made to date, share key learnings, and demonstrate new opportunities in a very articulate way.  Katie – you added tremendous value on the social media side and have already made an impact to the campaigns – to ensure we are mindful of new testing methodologies as well as visual approaches that should increase our impact.  Thank you both for your great efforts!\n\n382#Adjustments on the fly|Team, It was only four business days ago that we sat down and talked about our experiences from the first few executive forums and re-envisioned what it could be. In the ensuing days, I know that you all worked tirelessly to create the new experience that we had in mind. Today’s session was amazing and light years ahead of where we were this time last week. It’s because you had the courage and energy to take those ideas and make them real earlier this week. Thank you, and well done!\n\n383#Bringing it all together|I started over a month ago and after getting very behind on my inbox, I wasn't exactly looking forward to another onboarding session. However, I truly enjoyed your presentation and really appreciated hearing hopes and visions for the future of Workhuman after mostly retrospectives and demonstrations. Not only did you call out and encourage participation and feedback from the group, but you were the only presenter (if memory serves) to describe how your role and department interacts with every one of us. In my mind, that's what onboarding should be. I look forward to working with you. Thanks!\n\n384#The happiest and most helpful humans of all.|Z and Amy, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your help on some recent projects. Regardless of your workloads, regardless of how fragmented the asks, you are ALWAYS in my corner to help me navigate through all the things, help pick up the pieces and push on to a glorious and thoughtful end result. Thank you both for the awesome-ness, thoughtfulness and being AMAZING partners in crime. I don't know what I would do without you!\n\n385#agile tour presentation - Supporters!|Maeve, Amy and Jessica, thanks for all your support with my preparations for my presentation at the Agile Tour Dublin.  From the initial group training set up where the idea of presenting came about, to the individual training your arranged for me, the help with preparing the presentation and the on-the-day support with the Workhuman desk and raffle organisation; it all helped make this a success.  All this investment and preparation really worked and I received great feedback on the presentation at the event. I was really glad to have taken part in this new initiative and I look forward to my next presentation (or to attending one of your presentations! )\n\n386#Moments that matter in presenting!|Amy, thank you for offering your speaking engagement coaching expertise in preparation for the HR Tech presentation(s). I so appreciate your advice and honesty in how I can personally enhance my presentation style and approach. I took your feedback to heart and most definitely applied it during the real thing! Gratitudes, Amy!\n\n387#Bringing the Humanity at HR Tech|Dan, Amy, Mike, and Max - Wonderful work at the HR Tech conference in Las Vegas. Shows like this are an incredible opportunity to influence the market - through key influencers, analysts, customers, and more.  There are countless items that play into the strategy - from social presence to meetings to sessions to dinners to drinks to content. It's a constant flurry of activities that show who we are as a company and people. Thank you for the passion you brought, the eagerness to learn and make new connections, and all the great relationship building along the way!\n\n388#It takes a village.|I'd like to express my gratitude to this group of Workhuman superstars. Each of you stepped up in the last few weeks to contribute a post on the Workhuman blog. None of you are full-time writers, but each of you helped bring new stories and perspectives to our readers this month. From event recaps to personal gratitude stories to showing the business value of investing in recognition, these posts add to the rich fabric of thought leadership content our readers expect. Thank you for patiently working with me on rounds of edits and providing all those extra details like headshots, bios, and other images. Looking forward to more posts from you in the future!\n\n389#Off to a great start|Amy - this was a bit overdue, but now I have more to add! Thank you for being so open minded and enthusiastic about our new job kickoff process. Our meeting was the first time I had put this new process into play, and it was so energizing to have it so well-received by you. Not only were you willing to do a deep dive into all the things, but you came to our meeting SO well prepared - to discuss so many different aspects of your open position, your vision for PR, and the recruiting process. Since then, you've also taken the time to review resumes with me, and have stuck to your commitment to SUPER quick turnaround on candidate feedback. Thank you for such a great recruiting partner. I am truly looking forward to filling this job with you!\n\n390#Championing our Tech Community Champions|Ladies  ... I love the energy and passion you've both brought to this initiative!!  You've really led from the front, encouraging ideas and input and being super supportive to all. It's great to see the structure, supports, the encouragement and showcasing each individuals contribution and journey. Really well done, excited to see how this progresses .... super excited about our SWERVE lightening showcase!!\n\n391#It Takes an Army|I want to extend a special thank you to everyone involved in bringing together the Taste of Workhuman Live event series. Amanda/Amy for pulling together graticards, gratitude journals, speakers, coordinating content, setting up briefing meetings, and keeping everyone on track. Jess/Jen/Mike for the execution of campaign materials numerous operations requests, and fast turn-around timelines. Lynette - for being the rockstar that I knew you would be speaking at our events. Thanks for your constant energy and passion you bring to everything that you do. Also, for helping set up at Raleigh and Atlanta. Mark - for stepping up, helping research and cover for me while I was on vacation. Mike - for coming in last minute and saving the day with Laurie Ruettiman to speak at our events. Everyone made these events successful and spectacular. Thank you all!\n\n392#Exec Forum Powerhouse Partner|Amy - It was great to start off the Exec Forum fall tour with you by my side. You've been a powerhouse behind the scenes in securing executive speakers, managing changes on the fly, and helping to develop the messaging and content for the events. And your attitude and effort was no different on the ground - helping to set up, prep our speakers, welcome guests, have lively conversations, move tables, and take copious notes all along the way to capture the dialogue, discussion, and insights taking place in the room. I appreciate all that you bring to the table - and the forums - and I look forward to the future growth of the program with you on the team!\n\n393#The Workhuman Social Media Era Is Here|Amy, I wanted to say how much I appreciate how you have led Max and I these past few months. The social media team forming together is such a great opportunity for Workhuman and in some ways we were building it from the ground up. Lots of actions were already in place, but developing a whole new team is no easy feat! You always made it clear that you were available by any means. You helped guide us through all of these changes. You were able to provide your level of expertise to what we were doing to help us learn from you. You provided us support when we needed it. You are our #1 cheerleader. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are in a much better spot with your guidance and support. Excited to continue to partner and work with our new teams together! Thank you so much!\n\n394#MetroWest Women's Conference|I want to take a moment and thank you all for attending yesterday's event for the MetroWest Women's Conference. It was an successful event because we had some great leadership representing Workhuman as there lead Sponsor! Sarah, you were a true rockstar on stage! The recruiting team killed it at the table when people came running to see what jobs we had open after Sarah's keynote during breakfast! Kevin, Amy, Julia, and Miguel thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to represent Workhuman! It was a great day and I can't wait to partner with MetroWest again next year!\n\n395#aaaaand feedback on the fly!|Amy, thank you so much for giving me some super valuable feedback on the fly after my presentation at the conference yesterday!  I truly value your input and I am so looking forward to more opportunities for critiquing in the future! and.. and..and...and....... Luda out!\n\n396#For Immediate Release: Amy Rice is a PR Superstar|Amy, working with you for the last month or so on Workhuman's PR and external comms efforts as well as competitor research has been so great. Thank you so much for seeking me out and getting me involved where you saw/see fit. We have a great process for how we handle our releases and articles and that's only going to continue to get better.   Also, thank you for being an advocate for me and my work. I have a tendency to dive into the deep end on projects, and you let me figure things out then suggest areas to look into that I might not have thought about. You also are more than accommodating when I have a question or a finding. It seems like you might have like 15 minutes a day when you're not in meetings so I really appreciate you taking a couple minutes to listen to things that I found.    I'm really looking forward to our continued partnership, and I think you and I can accomplish a lot of awesome things for Workhuman with our joint efforts.\n\n397#Two four six eight who do we appreciate!|Only fitting that during the first week of the football season we recognize our very own QB1.    Thank you for your hard work and determination in proving out this new process.  It’s a grind.  Sometimes it’s just three yards and a cloud of dust.  (Not sure what that has to do with it but I’m sticking with the football theme) It’s not always flashy but you make it work.  So pull back and launch that Hail Mary because we are about to win this game!  It is a joy to be have you leading the team!\n\n398#For a fantastic Tech Communication Training|Thank you, Amy and Maeve for setting up and running the technology communication training. This was a very high quality session and is an important part of building out our employer brand in the Irish Market. Thank you for putting so much work into making the session meaningful. I got a lot from it and I know from being in the room that the attendees did.\n\n399#Paving the Path for Program Success|Amy - It’s seems quite unbelievable that you’ve only been back now a couple of months. In that time, you’ve tackled a lot. A whole lot!  PR, campaigns, social, a new thought leadership/speaker platform strategy, and more.  These are huge initiatives that involve many people across the company (and many details behind the scenes). And many of them are entirely new approaches for marketing. Each and every time, you jump right in with enthusiasm, focus, and passion to achieving success for the company (you’re also unafraid to try anything new).   A high growth company like ours takes that type of mindset and leader. Thank you for your continual strong efforts!\n\n400#Let's do this thing.|TEAM! Super inspired after our meeting yesterday. I love where this is going and am appreciative of all the hard work, thought, preparation and leadership in completely changing the way we are approaching this company-wide initiative. I'm excited to be involved and be a part of something so much bigger than just one project or one department. Way to innovate and lead the charge. Times are a changin' and I am HERE for it!! Well done! #gratitag\n\n401#In the trenches!|Amy and Lauren - I cant begin to express how much I have enjoyed working with you both on our various campaigns and programs this past month. You are both so talented and I love that we almost immediately were in sync. It’s been so refreshing working alongside each of you and I love that we have found a way to collaborate without stepping on each other’s toes. Amy, your ability to build a framework and program around abstract creative ideas is excellent. Lauren: your ability to craft messaging and tell stories is what brings colors and picture to life. We won’t get everything right, (eh, we’re human) but it’s great to know that we have each other’s back and will figure things out together. :)\n\n402#The Gratitude Effect|I am SO excited about where we are headed for our Gratitude Effect campaign. As a core team, we are learning what hasn’t worked and trying our new improved approach for this one. We are off to such a strong, strategic and efficient approach, I can’t wait to reveal it with the larger team tomorrow. In true test and learn fashion, let’s see if it works but even if it doesn’t, you were all so willing and open to trying, what more could I ask for? I’m so grateful for you!\n\n403#Partnering to push things forward|Thank you to this team for helping push things forward to secure a c-level speaker for the upcoming Evanta Summit. Kevin - Thank you for suggesting we schedule a meeting with Amy's team to discuss opportunities to partner in the future - and including this speaking engagement in our conversation. Stacey - Thank you for answering the many Evanta questions that Amy's team had in a timely manner (late on a Friday), so Amy's team had all the information they needed to position this opportunity to Amy. Amy - Thank you for taking the reins, especially as I was stepping out on vacation, to get this secured, schedule a prep meeting, and finalize the details. I'm grateful for your partnership!\n\n404#Flexible as Gumby...|Big thanks to all of you for your quick replies today, and your willingness to flex your schedules to accommodate an interview next week. Trying to book any interview is no easy feat, but especially when multiple calendars look really packed. You all replied to my call for help in a flash, and gave me the flexibility I needed to be able to get a schedule in place. Thank you so much for your commitment to recruiting efforts, and to adjusting to the currently market conditions. I appreciate you!\n\n405#GPTW company content|Thank you Kevin, Amy, Janna, and Greg for your help with firming up some answers for the company portion of our Great Place to Work submission. We could not have finished this up with the same quality without your eye and keystrokes contributing. Thank you for jumping in to help. Much appreciated!\n\n406#She is back!|Amy- Since you’ve been back, I’ve come to you with multiple requests...can you secure a speaker for this? How do I use you and your team? Can you come to our team meeting? Then last week, you reached out to me with a creative idea for #wethenorth, you built a team AND attended SHRM. And to think you’ve been back from MAT leave 3 weeks??!! What are you doing for everyone else? Total rockstar!! So excited for things to come!\n\n407#Is there a better example of teamwork? Nahhh|TEAM! I cannot express enough how much I appreciate you all jumping in to help me reel a candidate back in. I wish I could say that this was the first time in my recruiting career that a finalist candidate emailed me to say they were withdrawing from the process. And it certainly won't be the last. However - this was the first time I had multiple people on the interview team immediately jump in and offer their assistance in trying to save the day. With your help - we are back on track with this candidate. Regardless of whether or not this ends in an offer, I want you to know how much I appreciate your support in making this happen. You are all true partners and I'm so lucky to work with you.\n\n408#Relationship building and more at SHRM 19|Great job at SHRM Annual Conference this week!  This conference is a great relationship building opportunity – for us to continue to leverage the relationships we have and make new ones.  All with the intent of creating new business and thought leadership opportunities.  Mike – excellent work with the SHRM Foundation.  This year’s format was different than past years – but it remained a great way to connect with industry leaders and show Workhuman as a brand that cares. And the dinner with Cy Wakeman was amazing fun!  Dan – great job in leveraging the show to get competitive intel, industry information to help our content strategy and new ideas to help our future messaging. Amy – this was your first SHRM conference but you jumped right in!  You spent time at the booth, got some great media interviews and made new connections for Workhuman. Can't wait to see what comes of all of them. Well done all!\n\n409#BSI Event Security Presentation|Thanks for your swift work to turnaround the Security presentation updates for me. With Workhuman Live upon us and without much time to the event date you pulled out the stops and got me a finished product in doublequick time. Many Thanks\n\n410#Comms & Content Mastery at Workhuman Live|Wow. This team rocked Workhuman Live. It is truly an immersive adventure - with hard work and focus leading to \"our water\" - an incredible experience that will empower and enrich our leaders. On the content side, Dan - incredible leadership. You support and lift your team when they need it most - and spearhead so many other initiatives, particularly the post-show content strategy. Lauren C - words cannot fully describe your enormous impact on the event in managing our speakers and tracks. So many details - you get it done with poise, class, and determination. Sarah - your efforts leading our blog strategy has resulted in another step up for our on-site thought leadership. The bar has risen again! Lauren B - your creative approach continually up-levels the words that our attendees see throughout. And at the event, you were a huge part of the blogging efforts. Aaron and Lynne - fantastic job blogging at the conference, finding the right insights to help our attendees take back key learnings to help their organizations grow. Jess - while you were not able to join us at the event, you were invaluable leading up supporting so many writing needs (and your editing skills rock too!). For internal comms, Colleen - fantastic work leading our strategy this year, helping our company \"feel\" the event better than ever. Kristen - your creativity & determination brought it to life internally, plus your support on social was huge! Clare - loved your timely updates and great ideas. Your idea to ask Kat for an internal video was genius! For external comms, Mike - masterful job with our influencer community once again. Their engagement was incredible! 20 interviews including some of our keynotes with Workhuman Radio (your baby). Just amazing! And Amy, while you couldn't be there, your impact on our PR coverage was huge with some fantastic pieces and more to come. Thank you to the best comms and content team the event world has ever seen. Grateful for all of you.\n\n411#Rescue!|See that picture - that's you, jumping out of the 'copter to \"save\" me. In the lead up to the big event there is a lot going on. You've been a great teammate, offering to help at every turn. I am so very appreciative of you taking on the briefing book and getting it in such great shape while I was focused on other things this week. Thank you for all the great work you did and for continuing to say \"what else can I do to help?\" You're awesome!\n\n412#The Great Communicators of Workhuman|I am grateful for your collective amazing work on the brand evolution in the past couple of weeks. Each of you stepped up in different, very important ways to ensure we announced it to the wider world (and internally) in an effective, meaningful way. There were twists, turns, changes - but you rolled with it and focused on the larger objective. And of course, as big projects tend to do, the time needed to get everything done crept into evening hours (and sometimes early morning hours given our global needs). And yet, you were all undaunted and got it the timing and the messaging right.  Well done team!\n\n413#Making a Big Impact Immediately|Amy -  I am so very grateful that you joined the team. I have been so impressed and amazed by your work since coming aboard just a few weeks ago. You started during an incredibly busy time (even by our standards!) and have never been fazed. Even as we announce our brand evolution, you stepped right in to help bring it to market very successfully in both the US and Ireland. You continually ask the right questions, probe on the right topics, and are curious about the right areas of opportunity.  We have incredible momentum ahead for the company and brand, and your experience and knowledge has already paid dividends.  Cheers to the bright future ahead!  Kevin\n\n"
