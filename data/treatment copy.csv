Once these policies were in place, it took some time for older versions to age out. Now that the aging process has completed, the results have been remarkable: Storage usage dropped from over 7 TB to just over 1 TB. The previously largest site is now the 6th largest.

From the first pre-promotion touchpoint to the moment attendees walked into the space, to the content creation, the live on-site execution, the speaker curation and delivery, to the last-minute signage changes and the seamless video production—you owned it all. And you did it while managing thousands of humans moving through a complex environment, aligning every detail to our theme, our purpose, and our mission.  You brought Eric’s keynote to life with vision and thoughtfulness. You made sure our content tracks were cohesive, our speakers prepared and impactful, and our message loud and clear across every stage, room, and moment.  This was more than a flawless event. This was a defining moment of brand leadership—something only Workhuman could do, because of you.  I’m phenomenally proud of this team. Let’s carry this momentum into Orlando 2026.

After a 29-month cycle, I am extremely excited to share that they are the newest member of the WH customer family adding 50,000 more users to our platform!  It was a win that required significant effort and strategy led by Sameer with support from so many WH team members along the way to ensure we had a positive outcome.  During the course of the process we had more than 70 documented meetings and every engagement and deposit made was very intentional. This included having several key Qualcomm executives at WHLive, many “moments that mattered” (YOS videos, Birthday videos, delivering WH golf balls/shirts, even a video from Snapdragon stadium which is sponsored by Qualcomm), a strong ABM campaign (Custom demo, microsite, mood video), and lots of customer storytelling to create unparalleled levels of credibility.  This sales process was a rollercoaster ride with lots of twists and turns resulting in a head-to-head competition with Augeo who promised the world at highly aggressive prices. But at the end of the day Qualcomm realized that our level of experience, product capabilities, and strategic value we provide are hands down the best in the industry and we became the obvious choice.  This would not have happened without the tireless work of all involved including Hari Date, Nuvs, Erin Avery, Cam Torre, Martina Campbell, Jason Gori, Meisha-Ann Martin, Larry Dennison, Alessandra Fagone, Brian Moore, Brian Kennedy, Owen Cooney, Christopher Claude, Julia Towle, Emily Smith, Hillary Mahoney, Chuck Labovitz, Rich Sorrentino, Rahul Srinivasan, Nick Eng, Ekaterina Kim, and Nina Reichert.

The journey began in 2022 when the Daily Batch Revenue Recognition Project kicked off, upgrading from a previous monthly run. The was released in June 2023 and laid the building blocks for the production of Quicksight Revenue Reports, with daily data population. From there Fin Dev and Finance worked together to explore opportunities for various reporting requirements across Revenue and Awards. We have had countless workshops, meetings, messages, emails exchanges and much more to share ideas, requirements around source data, content, definitions, calculations, format, structure, visuals, improvements, the list is endless. I’m delighted that we have now released the first two reports to Production, with a number more in development. The benefits of the automation of these reports include time saving efficiencies, quality control, removal of risk of manual error and the ability for daily refresh. The building blocks in the development of the domain and core models also opens the door for endless opportunity and efficiencies in further report development.

Cam & Kev, as you may recall, we held a call on that fateful to discuss. We knew our agreements allowed us to charge clients ""for additional Users above the designated Quantity"", but we also knew that due to a lack of process & data transparency, our Humans could not ably act on this claim, leaving meaningful unbilled dollars on the table each year. By the meeting’s end, we crafted a vision, including mining data with Product to display via QuickSight, developing user reporting for our teams & our customers, defining what “valid” users are, and establishing overage thresholds. We did not lack inspiration, but lamented we were not organizationally ready for the discipline & insights needed to execute.  Apr 2024 - My sincerest thanks and congratulations to ALL of you business stewards, for assembling your talents to redefine the term “shared success partner”! After a 2+ year business transformation journey, you have successfully launched a thoughtful, 1st generation invoicing solution grounded in that Feb ‘22 vision. This month 55 clients were intentionally billed for their Q1 user overages, resulting in tens of thousands of revenues being realized for valued products & services – and this is the first of many quarters where this will routinely occur.  I laud your varied contributions that now benefit our company.

First, on Monday night at the Austin Taco Project, you were the only one who thought to offer me the chance to take a break from checking in speakers. It allowed me to mingle with them, which made such a difference in my interactions with them the rest of the week. Your inclusion made a significant difference, and I cherished that time.  Secondly, being included in Issa Rae's meet and greet backstage was unexpected and incredibly appreciated. As a newer member, I didn't anticipate to be included backstage at all. Your decision to invite me, even though you could have excluded me, was so thoughtful. It led to a memorable experience and a team moment in that photo opportunity with Issa that I would have missed otherwise.  Lastly, during Andy's book signing, you ensured I didn't miss a special moment when everyone headed to the room where Richard gave a ""cheers"" to our group. Your thoughtfulness in including me left a lasting impression.  So all of that to say, I just want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your genuine thoughtfulness as a leader. I've always been in roles that often go overlooked by supervisors and members of leadership for some pretty cool opportunities like the three I mentioned here. And the fact that you were aware and thoughtful enough to include me, when you didn't have to, and when nobody else would have, is something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It truly means more than you'll ever know.  I feel incredibly fortunate to work for and alongside you. Thank you for everything you do.",2024-04-23

I certainly couldn't have created or foreseen the impact this would have on so many and I am grateful that you trusted me to shepherd your vision out to attendees.  thank you so much for what you've done which is to create for everyone there last week the experience and feeling I had at my first Workhuman live.

All in the matter of hours at that! While Biogen is reducing the value of those large value cash awards, it is still a massive win to have 77% of what was invested last year in cash awards to now be non-cash, especially during a time when Biogen was looking to cut back in non-cash initially! This team came together to talk about the challenge we were faced with, review data quickly to make an informative and clear decision on a strategy, get a call scheduled in less than 24 hours and deliver a pitch that resulted in an email from the customer less than an hour later asking us to move these cash awards to non-cash.

Check, check, and check! Fast forward, you continue to lead all of the GE businesses through the strategy with the first one being, GE HealthCare! How? You lived their tagline every day be extraordinary, be curious, be bold! Now that GE HealthCare isn't tethered to a universal GE program, you are showing Ruth Nash, Kristin Hart, and Tatsuki Matsuyama all that's possible with the platform. The demo this week was SPOT ON! Getting them to imagine everything from a new program name to signal a change, to a new look/feel, experience, new features, making recognition easier, simpler, less steps and meaningful - the full power of the WH Cloud in action! It was thrilling seeing their eyes light up, the high level of engagement, questions and holding the attention for the full hour. That's hard to do with a group like GE HealthCare but not with you at the helm. Super impressive work! And what's more? This strategy is being played back to you as GE HealthCare is in the final stages of signing a renewal agreement in the next 60 days with a $10M annual investment that's going to be so much more in the months and years to come as they freely make decisions around program design, investment and high wattage of program communications.

Let's see, for Merck, you coordinated and led their semi-annual account review and made sure all the appropriate parties involved were on point with our messaging to the Executive Sponsor and program team.  Gathered the team to make sure we delivered 2 important 'Moments that Matter' to Merck.  And to cap it off, you've been deep into a renewal where we can finally see light at the end.   For Organon, there's too many items to list, but leading a successful QBR, coordinating countless meetings to discuss their product enhancements, bi-weekly check-ins with their exec sponsors, and another challenging renewal are just a few things going on with them. And let's not forget GE.  You're on top of everything we need as they prepare to spin-off into 3 different companies.  Your quarterly outreach to key stakeholders has brought a lot of energy and engagement into the program which has led to a number of gratitude summits.

An initiative code-named Project Aristotle studied hundreds of Google’s teams to better understand why some stumbled, whilst others soared. Google’s extensive research corroborated the importance of Amy Edmondson's coined phrase, discovering that Psychological Safety is a paramount component of High Performing Teams.   ⚠️ Building a fearless organization that truly embraces psychological safety will leverage the benefits of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), attracting and retaining a diverse environment of talented individuals, in addition to promoting innovation, connection, and a sense of belonging (DEIB).   🚀 Spark Director+ is a self-discovery journey within an overarching Leadership Learning Track, offered to Directors and Senior Directors who manage teams of all sizes.   📢 Please join me in applauding our enthusiastic Workhuman Executive Leaders who participated in this month’s Psychological Safety module: Adam, Amy, Andrew, Colleen, Jason, Jeff, Laura, Linda, Martina, Michelle Drozdowski, Michelle Lane, Michelle McDaid, Niall, Rich, Tyler, Varun, and Zhennaa, thank you for your valued partnership as Psychological Safety Ambassadors.

Amanda - there were so many special touches you facilitated from the Tunde Oyeneyin cameo, signed book, the caricature, the video, it all came together in a big way. I can't say it better than Christopher himself:   ""On the drive home from my offsite today, I phoned my wife to tell her how much I could not wait to share the video you all sent to me.  She told me that two packages had just arrived for me.  We opened them together when I got home and honestly, she said to me, “Wow, they are so thoughtful and really seem to know you well!  I am blown away!  I am really digging the caricature full of images of things I enjoy so much – to cook, homemade pasta, Trader Joe’s, my little pooch Maya and a nice glass of wine!  The new pasta machine is over the top!  I hope one day we can all get to make some together – I would love that opportunity!  You all really made today very memorable for me!   Throughout the video, your words of appreciation and gratitude really made me blew me away.  The photos of moments that represent highlights of our work and fun together were awesome too!   I had Olivia and Dale watch the video with me and they felt so proud of and for me!  It really was an incredible moment to share with them!  My Olivia was so surprised and excited at Tunde’s message to me in the beginning only to freak out at the callout to her personally toward the end.  I cannot even describe Olivia’s reaction to the personalized message/signed copy of Tunde’s book – off the chart!    Thank you all so very much!

This is an extremely difficult task to meet from both ends but they do this with ease. The partnership between Customer Success and Finance has grown significantly and I know I can always count on both of them for assistance/direction with understanding the customer's current situation; and their additional context is helpful with drafting new order forms and contractual conditions that fulfill customer immediate needs & WH policies and procedures simultaneously which ultimately renders greater cash flow, revenue recognition and overall profit to WH as a whole.  Additionally, their knowledge and continued support with communicating team awards (which tends to be more popular in the last year) and providing finance with the correct documents to properly review and approve these team awards have created a more efficient and effective internal request process. Above all, they also understand the finance, revenue and legal implications when proposing a new customer request to finance which is quite admirable.

You have so much knowledge of the business and how it operates at various level (from finance to commercial to operational) which helps me greatly when determining how best to approach a project or task to ensure my methodology aligns across the various functions (e.g. from a tax, finance, commercial and operational perspective). On a personal note, since joining remotely you and the rest of the Finance Team have made me feel very welcomed and part of a team. You have helped build a Finance Team which are friendly, helpful and strive for quality and a great reflection of what Workhuman is all about. I really enjoy working here and thanks for giving me the opportunity.",2022-01-04

You have led the external comms team through some massive wins this year. Creating new functions, huge media hits, onboarding agencies, moving away from processes that no longer serve us, adopting new ones, and always–ALWAYS–focusing on communicating with the team as much as possible. I have never worked with a leader who is more open to share information across the board as you, all in the name of keeping us informed for the better of the business. Something you've taught me since I first began reporting to you, last year and when I started reporting to you again this year (LOL), was to write down when you are trying something new. ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it"".  This Ferris Bueller quote comes to mind when I think of your advice here, because it's true. We move so fast in our day to day, that if we don't take the time to stop and look at where we are compared to 1 month or even a year ago, we will never recognize and appreciate the growth. It's a simple exercise that has a huge impact on confidence and appreciation for the journey. Thank you for an incredible year of growth, connection, and support. Grateful for all you do!",2021-12-16

You all have been facing in impending RFP for quite some time and due to all of your determination and perseverance, have made it look easy for Phil Morgan to say, “I’m Happy and lets just sign for another three years… just send over the paperwork”.  Each of you has played an integral role in keeping this longstanding, not so easy to please mega customer engaged with Workhuman.  You have worked hard to continue to build incredible trust, restore happiness and inspire a bright future together in the partnership.  2020 brought so many ups and downs across different businesses at GE and you all maneuvered through it all with remarkable grace and fortitude.  This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Vincent Van Gogh, “Great things are done by a series of small things brough together”. In GE’s case, small things brought together include Strategy Sessions for their 4 IFGs, getting leadership to see the importance of recognition, regaining momentum, supporting GE’s tough eCommerce requests, aligning the IMPACT program to key IFG initiatives like Leadership Principles and building executive relationships with the likes of Laura Cococcia, Head of HR Strategy and Program Management, who’s partnering with us to build out GE’s HR development forums. She’s using words like “It would be impactful to have Eric and Kevin (CHRO of GE) do a fireside chat on the future of work.” These are game changing statements and only possible through all of the small things, initiatives, sweat and tears over the years! I’m so proud of each and every one of you for making an IMPACT on GE, our company and our movement! It takes a village and the Workhuman villagers are unstoppable!!",2021-05-21

This is a feature that we, despite being Survey design and Insight wizards, completely forgot about! We agreed that it was a great idea to personalise the question and subsequent benchmark analysis showed that personalisation can increase response rates up to 2.5 times!! This means a) faster data collection and b) smaller audiences can be targeted within our surveys leading to more agile and versatile Insights. This story shows the importance of working together. We shouldn't over rely on your knowledge and experience... People that wear different hats than us, can bring new ideas outside of our comfort zone yielding better quality and more customer centric outputs.

I wanted to call out specifically how artfully the crossover between these two influential clients crystalized in two distinct moments this week, due to the your strategic guidance.  First, a lot of careful preparation was needed for Merck's annual review meeting this week as we faced a time crunch and a delicate balance of focusing on Merck's program performance while also acknowledging the Organon attendees. You worked through the right approach with our team and outreach to Peter, and what resulted was a jam-packed meeting where Jeff and Aaron as executive sponsors spoke highly of our partnership and impact of INSPIRE, with Aaron telling how how powerful he found it and the reason he  wants to focus on it to stand up the culture at Organon. The other Organon attendees chimed in and spoke glowingly of our relationship and understanding the ""art of the possible"" with their new program. Second, we had a financial overview meeting with Organon today to go over contract costs as well as the costs associated with adding new cloud elements. Not the most exciting meeting topic on the surface but I was blown away when Peter kicked off the meeting for a recognition moment FOR US! He congratulated us on hosting a great meeting, and called out specifically how pleased Jeff and Aaron were. Mariel added that not all parts of Organon's implementation are going well but working with Workhuman is ""optimal,"" ""what teamwork looks like,"" and that our hard work ""is very much noticed"". Two pleased executive sponsors (and new CHRO)? Check. Two pleased PMs? Check! Two pleased project teams that were shown in the best light in front of their leaders? Check.  Soon to be launched client trusting our advice and actively seeking to implement new products? Check. No limits to what you can achieve? Happy Check Ten!",2021-04-17

Our team is often under pressure to deliver quickly and to do only what is necessary, but you challenged us to go beyond that and to imagine a unified fee solution, and then you gave direction, encouragement and time for that vision to formulate and evolve into a solution. You also got ahead of the Accenture shockwave to allow us to prepare and to calmly work through the complexities without the familiar time-constraints and pressure to size work with lots of uncertainty.  You demonstrated great leadership and you lead by example in accepting the possibility that Accenture might sign contracts, and the redemption fees are now a core part of our business, not just for one or two clients, and you took responsibility for that in making time for us all to prepare. I believe we have all seen the benefit of your foresight and leadership in the comprehensive, thought-out, low-risk solution that we have prepared, and it is also reflected in the calm confidence and pride across the whole team in approaching this work.

But as is the case with Producers, you stay behind the camera, racing to manage other things instead of pausing for a photo op.  The reason Workhuman is able to have Cy in the May event is because of the professional relationship you've built over the past few years. She knows you, trusts you, and respects you as the leader of our events. Thank you for bringing your expertise and mindful approach to all of our events. ",2021-03-18

During one our most challenging years ever, you both double-down on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion with some of our largest customers - Merck, GE, Eaton and Corning, to name a few.

Imagination was lived as you embraced moving beyond traditional ways of doing things, creating new relationships with Chief D&I officers, DEI ERGs and continually demonstrating your ability to inspire others, pivot when needed and ultimately get to victory! Determination was lived as you stayed focused and composed in stressful situations. WH didn't always have all the answers, ""flying and building"" out these capabilities at the same time, learning and taking constructive action to navigate difficulties all for the betterment of what WH and customers could achieve together! Innovation and delivering on ""moonshots"" is now here. Merck will launch the new Inclusion Awareness capabilities on March 17th to an ""early access"" group. Eaton has said ""Let's Do."", Corning is ready for the next meeting and GE is primed and future meetings getting set-up.

You’ve worked tirelessly for months on this effort almost exclusively. For us, you’ve been anchors, guides and champions at every turn.   We imagine that taking a new product to market might normally be equal parts product and marketing. With the nature of Certified, it’s fair to say that the scales might’ve been tipped a bit in your direction. In truly unorthodox fashion, we even leaned on Marketing to help build part of the product itself, and you had the added nuance of stepping us through our first-ever go-to-market experience. I didn’t even know what GTM stood for when we started! We’ve both learned so much from you and it’s been an absolute pleasure sharing the journey. The volume of tasks you’ve managed, hurdles overcome, strategies brainstormed and executed, priorities juggled, stakeholders accommodated, and hours put in – too many moments, too much output to mention, where your immense talent and commitment made good things happen. You guys are really, really good at what you do. Workhuman and the Certified team are fortunate to have you.

We hadn't been able to speak with Justin and other key stakeholders for quite some time, and the hard work you put in enabled us to deliver the key data and ideas that will grow Biogen's already high-performing program. Sheri, you expertly laid the foundation for the day's discussion by allowing Justin & team to communicate their 2020 people strategy, and then layered that into your outline of our current insights and solutions. Traci & Maggie, as always you impressed with your convincing content and enthusiastic approach towards explaining the philosophy of working human and how it's changed (and continues to improve) the way we work. Erica, your Biogen-specific insights around turnover and how organic recognition has seen some positive post-pandemic growth was crucial to the meeting, and clearly caught Justin's attention. It's data like this that will help us keep a strong foothold with him and drive our initiatives forward - running deeper analyses, refreshing/relaunching their site and then hopefully adding items such as Life Events and Service Timelines.

In particular for 606, you guided us as team through a 2 year long project that has now crossed the finish line. Your vast knowledge of the US GAAP process was a key contribution to making sure the model operated correctly, you constantly challenged us in terms of the whys and potential gaps, supported us with clear guidance, and kept us in check for timelines and milestones throughout. You allowed the space for us to step away from other areas, which was key to ensuring we had the capacity to make sure this was executed to plan.

This level of success took thoughtful planning, decisive and quick action, creativity, and relentless outreach to secure exceptional guest speakers, high profile customer stories, and new sponsorships. There was clear demonstration of teamwork, resilience, grit – and quite a bit of “good cheer” across this group. It was an example of Workhuman at our best.

When Erica presented some insightful results into what WHARI is telling us which sparked the topic about building back trust and empowering employees to own the culture by nominating more frequently but encouraging the smaller awards, you could hear the AHA moment in the room where the HARMAN team simply stated we have to use this budget even more so based on some of those findings that WHARI highlighted!!! It was great to hear Lori (HARMAN’s VP Reward) make those comments and openly ask for our guidance and how we best execute a 2020 plan of action that includes a turbo boost in comms, manager training, educating division leaders on the fact that Be Brilliant is an investment and not a spend, holding leaders accountable to nominate more frequently!! And there was more, with great interest with the PENDO project, thanks Erin for bringing them through this impressive initiative which they really liked and can see the benefits of it to help improve further adoption. Finally, thanks to you Sheri for making the trip down to Stamford to be the face for Workhuman and for making sure we addressed all the topics we prepped for!!   It’s always a great sign the meeting was a success when you get an email from the client saying ""just left the meeting feeling energized and ready to bring BE BRILLIANT to the next level’! Roll on 2020!! ""Well done everyone!!",2019-11-14

Wow, I feel like I just finished a Master's Class in advanced Business Strategy and Execution thanks to you! Talk about formulating a strategy, changing perspectives on what's possible, and aggressively mapping steps to clearly accelerate program growth and sustainability in the most challenging times ... you nailed it! GE has been in the news for years with headlines like 'Will GE Survive?, Will GE Ever Bounce Back?"". In true Sheri fashion you saw this as an incredible opportunity to help GE rethink the power of recognition to transform culture, boost morale, increase engagement and keep employee's feeling their work had a purpose and is valued.   You put your strategy into motion! First, creating connections with senior leaders/decision makers. You secured a half-day slot for WH at Kosta's HC HRLT meeting to share the Future of Work, what's possible through recognition, and how to invest properly to achieve desired talent and business outcomes. They quickly understood the value of increasing peer to peer recognition moments, lower value awards given more frequently and embedding this mindset change into communication strategies and tactics for managers and individual contributors. Kostas even stated ""We need more recognition happening daily. There is enough budget to spend $10-15M on this program this year"".    Second, you urgently brought WH thought leadership to all GE's Businesses - HC, Power, Aviation and Renewables - knowing investment next year will be decided at this level. You relentlessly pursued setting up Design Labs with decision makers, strategized on 'Quick Wins' and Long-Term Goals. This resulted in 30+ new connections, renewed excitement about social recognition, mindset of more peer recognition and lower value awards given more frequently and how to fund. 1st 10 months of 2019 vs. 2018, GE's spend increased by $6M, or 27%. Can't wait to see what 2020 brings with the new foundation in place! You Rock! #MakingImpact. ",2019-11-07

The level of trust and respect in the room is a testament to the close partnership that's been cultivated over the 2+ (really 3+) years by you three. Some of the magical moments that come to mind: Jeff, their SVP of Global Compensation & Benefits, congratulating us on a successful launch of their ""peers"" J&J, and telling us that it's a close-knit community in human health sciences, so word spreads fast when things go well.  Aaron, another executive program sponsor, telling us, ""This partnership has made this company better. We've been able to touch clients' lives in a positive way."" Michaela, our program manager, describing our common sense of purpose and symmetry in our businesses, we both focus on humans. Erin, your involvement at both ends of the Merck journey, as LSM and now the critical linkage to Product has been invaluable. As Jeff states that he's asked Outlook integration every year, and he's going to ask for it for the third time, it was perfect timing to turn to you and have you be able to provide a glimpse of things to come.

At the end of their full day Learning Expedition, I had asked them to think back on the day and share an inspiring moment(s) that resonated deeply with them and think about what they can take back and action in their organizations. With regards to the experience, here is what they had to say ""One of the things that we can learn from this Learning expedition is that we should invest more in the human experience and how impactful that is. What a fantastic day this has been from the very beginning even before we arrived. From the hotel room drops, to the hand written notes, to the welcome party, the thoughtful gifts of resources and the charger in the reusable tote bags and charges as well as the personal videos that brought the voice of our employees to us... such incredible attention to detail... We need to do a much better job at thinking about this and putting the human equation into the experience"". All the hard work and coordination and putting humans in the forefront has made such an impression and has inspired 39 SE Executives and their CHRO to aspire to emulate what we do! The infinite ways in which we thought about the details has brought about admiration in a way we never thought we would actually heard vocalized so explicitly and sincerely! They didn't just say this once either! So many thank yous with similar elaborate specifics were shared by the likes of the CHRO of NAM, VP of HR, SVP of Talent, SVP of Global Rewards and their Global CHRO! To think that this was our very first one and with 39 Executives from all across the globe too!! Cheers to you team and I cannot wait to see how much more we will learn and grow from this fantastic kick off!                           ",2019-06-05

Yesterday we had the chance to sit down with both the core program team and our executive sponsors and review the last 18 months of Inspire.

They also said the data itself shows they hit an unmet need and proves that Merck has truly created a culture of recognition. Aaron couldn't stop talking about the amazing anecdotal feedback he has received all across the globe. These praises are a true testament to the hard work you each put into this program every day. Jay- you are the glue that keeps everything together. You go above and beyond to keep Merck happy, and have truly earned their trust at all level. It's not every day an executive sponsor says he's not worried about the spend... Joyce- your ongoing communications continue to help Merck capitalize on areas of opportunity. You have worked hard recently to help them target managers and increase their manager reach. Not to mention you always bring the human element, whether it's celebrating Cheryl's birthday with a cake or bringing gigantic Whoopie Pies to celebrate a 30 Year Anniversary. Sheri - it's clear that you have gotten executive buy in across the organization and the team was so impressed with your suggestions on utilizing WARI.

Gulfstream missed that the Timelines digital award messaging was not exactly what they wanted and they had no approval to use the CEO's name on the tool - a serious issue for them. This meant we had over 500 awards to cancel...and reprocess. Due to their extremely custom mgr pack process, we had a lot of systems pieces to work out. Jillian, when I texted you the heads up that I'd need assistance early, you replied with ""Not a prob-we'll get it done!"". You worked the test WBAU with an assist from Nicholas and created the new WBAU that I needed their approval for within an hour of coming in; this included multiple tests of the new award msg. Bill/Amanda/Gavin, we had to figure out how to reprocess all these awards without triggering add'l orders to Allied - thank you for taking the time to work through this very important piece together! We vetted out the scenarios, found the best option and I was able to configure as needed. Cam, as always, you supported through the entire process. While this was a ton of work internally, to the client it did not appear that way; they were happy/appreciative that we could have 500+ awards tested, processed and confirmed within the same business day. I could not have done this without your collaboration, time, effort, support and willingness to get it done. Amazing team effort - thank you, thank you, thank you!",2018-08-21

Each and every one of you contributed significantly to help me manage this and I can’t thank you enough. Throughout the past 3 weeks, there have been 80 Jira tickets opened in relation to their UAT – slowness in Sandbox, award highlighting issues, translations galore, static drive updates, invoice updates, email template problems, transformation rules, privacy language changes, login errors, escalations… the list goes on and on. As if everything I just listed wasn’t enough work for you, all of this was going on through ADL issues, general sandbox issues, and releases. A special shout out to Stephen and Yuliya for joining daily calls and helping sift through all the tickets and ensuring the right ones were looked at with urgency. The team has seriously stepped up to resolve all these tickets to help get Dell through UAT. With your help, they are slated to officially sign off on UAT this week!

Joyce, thanks for running with all of Harvard Pilgrim's requests. For such a quiet client, they had lots of questions while I was out, and some of them were completely unrelated to comms. You still jumped in, followed up and made sure they got the answers they needed. Sarah - as always, the yin to my yang with our many launches. DJO was in the best of hands, and you re-scheduled meetings, fielded questions, followed up on outstanding items, and kept the project moving while I was out. Do you even need me anymore?!? And Cam - thank you for stepping up to answer the launch related questions my clients had while they were out.

With some bumps in the road in their crazy custom mgr packs, you stayed on after we launched to guide the process, support the technical processes and ease the clients mind - all equally important pieces. You have also proactively done work (setting up the Retirement program in Sandbox so I could demo next day for 1 example) without being asked, which was just plain incredibly kind of you and allowed me to focus on the bigger issues at hand. On top of that, during our handover meeting, we discussed the standard items (unusual processes, relationship knowledge, etc) but also highlighted areas of interest for them that I can now use as I manage the program - coming at it from an account management perspective! This blew me away; proactively knowing these areas of interest means I can add those metrics to the other areas I would normally watch and include in account reviews. Sharing info at this level is priceless for me as the CSM.

Your insight on how to approach the award levels discussion with them, using the budget tab in the project plan, suggesting two different tracks on how they could structure and having a third to fall back on was HUGELY helpful.

With Phase 1 of their pilot complete, we took the opportunity to go onsite for a debrief of the program and discuss the strategy as we look to begin Phase 2.  Fannie Mae had previously held focus group sessions with their pilot teams and this was a great chance for us to learn from them on what employees thought of the program.  There was a lot of great feedback collected that we can now use as we move forward.  Although Fannie Mae took more of a ""hands off"" approach during Phase 1, they now realize that the key to success will be ""Prescription and Accountability."" They even suggested themselves that for Phase 2, they will make a bigger splash in communicating the launch as well as continuing the communications throughout the pilot.  It's always great to have a customer come to these realizations themselves which means we are all on the same page moving forward.  Although they still have some final decisions to make internally with both Phase 2 and beyond, this was another big step in moving our partnership forward with the Conversations team.  Thank you all for your efforts and continued support through Fannie Mae's Conversation journey, I greatly appreciate it",2018-05-10

Thank you so much for jumping in to support me on an amazing opportunity that I am working on for MasterCard. We have the attention of their EVP of Global Total Rewards right now to grow their recognition program to possibly 1-2% of payroll, and we needed to build a business to tell this story in less than 6 slides...and to do all of this within a 2 day turnaround  I had over 10 decks up on my laptop when trying to figure out the right slides to include here, but needed some help organizing my thoughts. You got on a call with me, listened to what the opportunity was/ a background on the account, and somehow turned around an amazing story in less than 2 hours! You then helped me craft a meaningful message to send in addition to the slides, which was just perfect! In just a few sentences, we were able to demonstrate how strategic recognition not only reinforces the values of a company, but also has been found to be one of the least expensive levers to make an impact on an employee's experience at work. Only two days after sharing this information, my main contact, the VP of Total Rewards, Rosanne was able to secure a meeting with the EVP of Global Total Rewards & the Business Financial Officer of HR. During this meeting, Rosanne's goal is to use this data to not only secure additional funding for this year to support the activity levels that have far exceeded their budget thus far for 2018, but to set up the proper investment for 2019. When I asked if she thought we were going to have any pushback in getting additional funding for 2018, the VP said absolutely not! In fact, she is thrilled to kick off a partnership with WorkHuman Research Institute Team to further build the case with their own data. All of this is possible because of you, and your support in this crucial time. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",2018-05-10

Your expertise and judgment helped as every step of the way and you served as a great partner to many across the team- inside marketing, creative, sales, customer success and of course, finance! There are so many highlights for a project that started before WH 2017 ended: the RFP process that led to the selection of a strong and capable agency partner, many behind-the-scenes coaching sessions to ensure their success, a methodical approach to breaking down and planning different experiences and ensuring every key voice felt heard, and, importantly, managing critical relationships across the Austin Convention Center and hotel partners. You also were on top of every penny of the budget and promptly went into problem solving mode when faced with challenges-- for example, when we realized there was a very real chance the Fairmont might not open, you had a plan B in place immediately to compensate for the loss of 800 hotel rooms and the venue for multiple evening events!

Thank you for scurrying around over the last week to assist vetting out options and gathering up available sleeping room and conference space at the JW to ensure we deliver a cohesive customer experience and avoid this possible risk!  We now have a great back up option at the JW that should confirm today (fingers crossed) and 2 possible alternative back up plans in the works also!

Teva is going through an extremely tough time financially right now, with lots of unknown factors about where the organization is going and whether or not many of them will even have jobs in the new year. When Teva nearly canceled our account review due to these factors, you convinced them of the value meeting with us could bring, as we can help arm them with resources and research to help defend the program, should it come down to that. They not only agreed to keep the meeting, but the executive sponsor was present for the entire session, and found the research and data we had to share very compelling and helpful. Due to your convincing presentation, we will hopefully even be able to get their annual performance data to help run an ROI analysis on high performers and ensure they are kept happy and engaged throughout the difficult times ahead.

The Customer Lunch the next day, same thing! Every chair filled with laughing and smiling clients. So much detail goes in to each and every single hour of these events and we would not have pulled it off without you.
